Because of this, Spain is divided into 17 autonomous communities (''comunidades aut\\u00f3nomas''), plus two autonomous cities. As a result, some even describe Spain as a \\\"federation without federalism\\\". Some of the autonomous communities\\u2014notably the ones which have other official languages alongside Spanish\\u2014have been recognised as \\\"historical nationalities\\\" that have a unique historical identity.

There is everything from lush meadows and snowy mountains to huge marshes and deserts in the south east. While summer is the peak season, those who wish to avoid the crowds should consider visiting in the winter as not only is it normally mild and sunny, but attractions such as the Alhambra Palace in Granada and La Gran Mezquita in Cordoba will not be overcrowded. However the ski resorts of Sierra Nevada do get very crowded. The Mediterranean climate that predominates in Southern and Central Spain is noted for its dry summers and (somewhat) wet(ter) winters, so visiting in the winter or spring brings the added benefit of the vegetation looking much more healthy. Northern Spain (e.g. Asturias) on the other hand gets quite a bit of rain year round and is ripe with lush green vegetation even in August.\\n\\n===History===\\nSome of the earliest known remains of ''Homo'' of any kind ''in Europe'' have been found in Spain. Spain is also thought to have been the last refuge of the Neanderthals, and one of the few places that were inhabitable and inhabited throughout the ice ages.\\n\\n====Early Spain and Roman Era====\\n{{see also|Roman Empire}}\\nThe earliest inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula we have any profound knowledge of were Iberians, Celts (related to the Gaulish, Britannic and Central European Celts in language and culture) and Basques. As most of these groups had little to no written records we only know of them due to the descriptions of the Greek, Punic and later Roman settlers and conquerors, who colonised Spain from the South starting in the 3rd century BC. [[Latin Europe|Roman culture]] lasted on the peninsula for roughly half a millennium, when in the age of migrations the Visigoths conquered the Roman province of ''Hispania''.\\n\\n====Visigoth Spain====\\n{{see also|Goths}}\\nMost inhabitants of the area kept speaking Latin or rather Latin-derived languages/dialects and only a handful of Germanic words entered the Spanish language (''\\\"ganso\\\"'' being the most commonplace). Soon after their conquest, the Visigoths formed a number of rival \\\"kingdoms\\\" and petty noble states in almost constant conflict in ever-shifting shaky alliances with or against one another, giving rise to constant wars.\\n\\n====Muslim conquest and \\\"al-Andalus\\\"====\\n[[File:Alhambra palace and surrounding area.jpg|thumbnail|Alhambra and the city of Granada]]\\n{{see also|Islamic Golden Age|Al-Andalus}}\\nIn 711 one Visigoth ruler apparently called for the Umayyad Muslims to help in his fight against a rival. (Which one is unclear, as the historical records for this era in Spain are scarce and there are for example no contemporary Muslim sources whatsoever.) This proved more successful than he could have imagined, and by the end of the 8th century most of the peninsula was in Muslim hands. While the almost 800 years of divided rule by Christian and Muslim rulers on the Iberian peninsula was by no means peaceful, the modern narrative of a somehow concerted effort to \\\"regain\\\" the \\\"lost lands\\\" for Christendom was never the first, second or any priority for the majority of the Christian rulers. As a matter of fact, many times Christian rulers entered into alliances with Muslim rulers against other Christian rulers and vice versa. While the situation for Muslims in Christian lands and vice versa and Jews in either depended very much on the mood of the ruler and could lie anywhere on a range from benevolent ignorance to murder and expulsion, religious minorities had it a lot better in Spain than in most of the rest of Europe at that time. In fact the Sephardi Jews (named after the Hebrew word for Spain) were at that time not only one of the most important groups inside Spain in terms of science and education, but also dominant among the [[Judaism|Jewish people, worldwide]]. During that time an estimated 90% of Jews were Sephardi. (In the 19th century, on the other hand, roughly 90% of Jews were Ashkenazim [German and Eastern European, and primarily Yiddish-speaking].)\\n\\nHowever, this period ended when through conquest and marriage the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon as well as a couple of minor Christian lands were united and their rulers started a war of conquest against the Muslim rulers. The union of the numerous Christian kingdoms is commemorated in the modern Spanish coat of arms, which is an amalgamation of the coats of arms of the four main kingdoms prior to the union, namely the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Le\\u00f3n and Navarre. In the process of re-conquering Spain, many of the great mosques and synagogues were desecrated and converted into Christian churches.\\n\\nSome of the most glorious historical attractions in Spain date from the period of Muslim rule, including '''The Mezquita''', built as the Great Mosque of [[C\\u00f3rdoba (city, Spain)|C\\u00f3rdoba]] and the '''Medina Azahara''', also in C\\u00f3rdoba and now in ruins but still visitable as such and built as the Madinat al-Zahra, the Palace of al-Andalus; and the '''Alhambra''' in [[Granada]], a splendid, intact palace. There are also two synagogues still standing that were built during the era of Muslim Spain: '''Santa Mar\\u00eda la Blanca''' in [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]] and the '''Synagogue of C\\u00f3rdoba''', in the Old City.\\n\\n====Reconquista and Imperial era====\\n{{seealso|Age of Discovery}}\\nThis so-called \\\"reconquista\\\" was completed in 1492 with the fall of Granada, and all Jews were forced to leave Spain or convert that year; by 1526, all Spanish Muslims had suffered the same fate. 1492 also marks the point when Spain started to become the world's strongest empire with territories in [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], [[Africa]], and the [[Philippines]] (named after Spanish king Felipe II). The \\\"new Christians\\\" as they were called were often not sincere in their largely forced conversions and to ensure religious \\\"purity\\\", the notorious Spanish inquisition was set up. <!-- which nobody expected!--> Genetic studies made in modern times suggest that a large percentage of modern Spaniards have at least partial Jewish and/or Muslim ancestry, which might surprise some, as the concept of being a \\\"true Christian\\\" (rather than a \\\"converso\\\") soon began to get hereditary overtones, with the expulsion of all the descendants of forced converts from Islam in 1609.\\n\\nUnder the House of Habsburg, Spain became a personal union with the [[Austrian Empire]], and reached its height of power in Europe during the 16th and early 17th centuries, controlling much of [[Benelux]] and [[Italy]]. Spain was weakened as the House of Habsburg lost the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1648. Spain was further weakened by ineffective governance, religious intolerance that drove out the erstwhile prosperous and productive Jewish and Muslim minorities and hampered free inquiry and - paradoxically - Latin American gold and silver that devalued the currency and still couldn't cover war expenses. The Spanish Habsburgs - prone to marrying inside the family, thus accumulating inheritable diseases - died out when Charles II was unable to produce an heir, which like many of his other afflictions was likely a result of incest. Most powers of Europe fought for the possibility to put one of their own on the Spanish throne, with the House of Bourbon doing it. The Bourbons would attempt a reform of their many domains gaining some successes but enraging those who had held onto old privileges of local autonomy or feudal rights.\\n\\nThe colonisation of Central and South America and of [[Mexico]] was particularly profound, with the deaths of millions of native people through disease, war and outright murder as the Spanish sought riches in these 'undiscovered' lands. Today many of the countries in this area are defined by Hispanic language and culture (Spanish is today the world's second most spoken native language after Mandarin and before English, and Catholicism dominates throughout the former Spanish colonies).\\n\\n====Crises of the 19th century====\\nWith the death of Charles III in 1788, Spain lost its last monarch with will, energy and capability for a long time at a crucial juncture - the French Revolution would break out the next year. His successor Charles IV tried at first to maintain some of his father's policies but ultimately saw more fun in hunting than politics. Soon politics in Spain would come to be dominated by Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy who was rumored to have an affair with the queen. Meanwhile, Charles' son, Ferdinand VII was chomping at the bit to replace his father as king, which earned him the contempt of the latter. In 1808 Ferdinand seemed to have briefly succeeded in replacing the hated Godoy and his father but Napoleon Bonaparte invited the two quarrelling kings to Bayonne under the pretext of mediating but forced both to abdicate in favor of his brother Joseph Bonaparte. Many among Spain's elites were having none of it and set up ''Juntas'' to maintain a government nominally loyal to Spanish monarchy. The liberal constitution of Cadiz 1812 was drafted in those years and as Ferdinand was willing to promise everyone everything to return to the throne, he came to be known as \\\"the Desired One\\\", with high hopes that he would rule as a liberal citizen-king under the constitution of Cadiz. Ferdinand never intended any such thing and his heavy-handed policies brought the wrath not only of his Spanish subjects but even of those ''Juntas'' in Latin America that had been set up without making up their mind whether to support a restoration of Bourbon rule or independence - only certain that they would oppose Napoleon and his regime. When Ferdinand died in 1833 he left a nominally absolute monarchy with an unhappy population which had lost most of its colonies to a not-yet three year old Isabella II. Immediately some hyper-conservative elements but also those in the Basque country who wanted back the old ''fuero'' autonomy refused to back Isabella's claim on account of her being female, giving birth to the \\\"Carlist\\\" movement.\\nThe 19th century saw independence movements fight back against the kingdom of Spain, with leaders such as Sim\\u00f3n Bol\\u00edvar and August\\u00edn de Iturbide successfully creating new independent nations throughout Latin America. By 1898 Spain lost the majority of its remaining territories during the Spanish-American War: it lost [[Cuba]] and then sold [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Guam]] to the [[United States]]. The war of 1898 was a huge shock to Spanish culture and shattered Spain's self-image of a first-rate power, and it thus inspired a whole literary movement known as the generation of '98. For much of this time, Spain was not really ''one'' realm so much as ''several'' realms which shared a monarch. While the monarch had broad powers, there was no such thing as \\\"absolute\\\" monarchy in Spain and the various regions - notably the Basque country - had numerous special privileges and autonomies granted either to \\\"the people\\\", a local lord or \\\"free men\\\". This proved complicated to resolve when Spain became a Republic and it is still an issue with which Spain is grappling in the 21st century.\\n[[File:Sagrada Familia Eixample from Montjuic.jpg|thumb|Sagrada Familia, the Gaudi masterpiece in the [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]] region of [[Barcelona]]]]\\n\\n====The 20th century====\\nSpain experienced a devastating civil war between 1936 and 1939 that killed half a million Spaniards and ushered in more than 30 years of dictatorship under Generalissimo Francisco Franco. The civil war began from a mostly failed coup in Spanish North Africa (today part of Morocco) against Spain's left-wing republican government supported by the popular front (a popular front was in those days a regime including communist, socialist, liberal, Christian Democrat and even conservative parties and originated in France as a response to fascism, though the parties in power in July 1936 were Izquierda Republicana and Uni\\u00f3n Republicana, two centre-left wing republican parties, supported by PSOE; the communist party had just 17 seats). The fascist side was led by a group of generals; however, some of them soon died in plane crashes or were pushed to the side by Franco. Although the League of Nations (a precursor of today's United Nations) attempted to make intervention impossible, Mussolini's Italy and Nazi Germany ignored this by aiding the nationalist (Franco) side, while the Soviet Union and to some extent Mexico provided aid to the Republican (popular front) side. The Republican side called for volunteers in the so-called \\\"international brigades\\\", and around 20,000 Brits, Americans, Frenchmen and even Germans joined the fight on their side. However, the Republican side was plagued by lack of weapons and ammunition (some of their rifles were produced in the 19th century), by infighting between communists and anarchists, and by Stalinist purges ordered by the super-paranoid supporters of Republican Spain in Moscow. As many people of that generation fought in the Spanish Civil War or covered it as \\u2013 often blatantly biased \\u2013 war correspondents (including George Orwell, Ernest Hemingway and later German chancellor Willy Brandt) there is a lot of well-written literature (and some films), which while not always historically accurate, manage to perfectly capture the spirit of vain idealism that made many of the interbrigadistas go to Spain in the first place. Just as the [[American Civil War]] gave a breakthrough for photojournalism, [[World War I]] for news radio and World War II for the newsreel, the Spanish Civil War made its mark on journalism, literature and arts. The Reina Sofia museum in Madrid has an exhibition for artistic expressions of the war, with Picasso's ''Guernica'' \\u2013 produced for the republican Spanish pavilion at the 1937 world exhibition in Paris \\u2013 as its centrepiece.\\n\\nThe war was won for Franco through superior fire-power and with military aid from the Nazis (including the war-crime of bombing [[Guernica]]). Franco managed to unify the not at all homogeneous nationalist forces behind his less-than-charismatic leadership and hold onto power through the [[World War II in Europe|Second World War]] (in which he stayed neutral) until his death. He was succeeded by King Juan Carlos. The Spanish Civil War is still in some sense an open wound as it was hardly ever talked about during the days of Franco's regime. To this day, conservatives and Catholics (the Republicans were pretty anti-clerical) are sometimes apologetic about Franco and the \\\"necessity\\\" of the war. Franco's legacy was that the historically important regional identities and languages (such as Catalan and Basque) were brutally suppressed and a policy of strong national identity under the Spanish/Castilian language was promoted. Many Republican soldiers and supported continued fighting until the mid 50s in the so-called maquis, in 1944 there was even an attempt to invade Spain from France through the Vall d'Aran in 1944 which was quickly suppressed by the Guardia Civil. Violent groups such as ETA (see below) started their activity in the 1960s during Franco's time, there was also an increasing protest movement in the last years of franquism. Franco oversaw Spain's rapid economic expansion with its industrialisation in the 1960s. Spain's messy divorce from its African colonies in the last years and days of Franco's life is also one of the reasons for the conflict in [[Western Sahara]], a former Spanish colony.\\n\\nFranco named Juan Carlos as his successor in 1969, with Juan Carlos being crowned king shortly after Franco's death. Shortly after King Juan Carlos \\u2013 to the surprise of many \\u2013 insisted on the country becoming a parliamentary democracy with a figurehead king as nominal head of state, right-wing generals tried to overthrow the nascent democracy on 23 February 1981 in what is now known as 23F. One of the most striking images of the coup was the general Tejero storming into the Congress of Deputies at the head of 200 Guardia Civil members and interrupting the vote to replace centre-left Adolfo Suarez with centre-right Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo for Prime Minister. The coup failed mostly due to lack of popular support and because the king \\u2013 in his capacity of commander-in-chief \\u2013 appeared on television in full uniform to order the soldiers back into their barracks, thus throwing his lot in with democracy. This resulted in a lot of support for the king personally even among otherwise republican-inclined Spaniards for most of his reign. However, the monarchy is rather unpopular among the autonomist or independist movements of Catalonia or the Basque Country. Spain entered NATO (though not the EU or any of its predecessors) in 1982, which Calvo-Sotelo. The ruling centre-right party UCD under Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo badly misjudged the Andalusian desire for regional self-government and thus lost the 1982 election, in one of the biggest popular vote landslides in any modern democracy, to the leftist PSOE. This led to the formation of Partido Popular (PP) from the rubble left behind by the temporary collapse of the centre-right. PSOE was led at that time by the relatively youthful Andalusian Felipe Gonz\\u00e1lez and enjoys a strong basis of support in Andalusia to this day.\\n\\nWith the peaceful transition to democracy after Franco's death, the restrictions on regional identity were lifted, with autonomy granted to several regions, and the regional languages gaining co-official status in their respective areas. The nature of the transition meant that there was little justice for those who had suffered under the Franco dictatorship and divisions still remain.\\n\\nThe Basque Country in Spain's north that had begun violent resistance in 1959 against Franco continued its campaign of bombings and assassinations into the democratic era with the terrorist ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna; Basque for Basque Country and Freedom) group, despite the region having been provided with a high degree of autonomy. The group declared a ceasefire in 2011 and the armed struggle appears over for the time being. Even in the \\\"democratic\\\" 1980s, (under longtime Prime minister Felipe Gonz\\u00e1lez [PSOE 1982\\u20131996]) the Spanish government responded with methods that are now known to have included \\\"death squadrons\\\" to combat terrorism.\\n\\n====21st century====\\nIn the 2000s there was more economic expansion and a housing price boom that subsequently collapsed, leaving Spain with high unemployment and economic difficulties. The economically important Catalan region has become louder in its demands for independence. In 2017/18 this conflict erupted as the central government had worked to annul key aspects of a more extensive statute of autonomy while parts of the Catalan parliament held an independence referendum, deemed \\\"illegal\\\" by opponents of independence. The central government cracked down heavily on the independence movement and several people involved in the referendum were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.\\n\\n====Migration====\\nSpain holds a historical attachment to its neighbours on the Iberian Peninsula, [[Andorra]] and [[Portugal]], to its former colonies, to former citizens and their descendants, and to a special category of former citizens, namely Sephardic Jews.\\n\\nThe population of Spain is growing in large part due to migration by people from relatively poor or politically unstable areas of Latin America, such as [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]] [[Nicaragua]], [[Peru]] or [[Venezuela]]; other parts of Europe, especially Eastern Europe; and Africa and Asia, particularly areas that have a historical or linguistic attachment to Spain. There is also an important segment of immigration that consists mainly of retired people, and people running businesses for them and foreign tourists, coming from wealthier European countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Benelux]] and the [[Nordic countries]], established all along the Mediterranean shore, especially in the [[Costa Blanca]], [[Costa del Sol]], the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Balearic Islands]], particularly in the summer months.\\n\\nInternally there have always been migrations from poorer rural areas (such as Andalusia) to the cities and to jobs in construction and tourism. Due to the economic crisis of the 2000s and 2010s, youth unemployment has risen to unbearable levels in the 50% range and quite a number of young people have semi-permanently fled the country to other European Union countries such as Germany to study, work or do internships either until things get better in Spain or forever. In the latter half of the 2010s there were tentative signs of economic improvement with some economic emigrants returning to Spain.\\n\\n===Tourist information ===\\n* [https://www.spain.info/ Tourist information website] of the Spanish government.\\n\\n==Talk==\\n{{see also|Spanish phrasebook}}\\n\\n{{infobox|I'm so pregnant|Many English words have their origins in Latin, which makes it easy for English speakers to guess the meanings of many Spanish words.

Many people, especially outside Castile, prefer to call it '''Castilian''' (''castellano'').\\n\\nHowever, there are a number of languages (Catalan, Basque, Galician, Asturian, etc.) spoken in various parts of Spain. Some of these languages are dominant and co-official in their respective regions, though most people will be bilingual in their local language and Spanish. Catalan, Basque and Galician are recognised as official languages according to the Spanish constitution. With the exception of Basque (whose origins are still debated), the languages of the Iberian Peninsula are part of the Romance family and are fairly easy to pick up if you know Castilian well.\\n\\n* '''[[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]]''' (Catalan: ''catal\\u00e0'', Castilian: ''catal\\u00e1n''), a distinct language similar to Castilian but more closely related to the Oc branch of the Romance Languages and considered by many to be part of a dialect continuum spanning across Spain, France, and Italy and including the other langues d'oc such as Proven\\u00e7al, Be\\u00e0rnais, Limousin, Auvernhat and Ni\\u00e7ard. Various dialects are spoken in the northeastern region of [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], and [[Valencia (region)|Valencia]] (where it is often referred to as ''Valenci\\u00e0''), east of [[Aragon]], as well as neighbouring [[Andorra]] and southern France. To a casual listener, Catalan superficially appears to be a cross of Castilian, French and Portuguese and though it does share features of all three, it is a separate language.\\n* '''[[Galician phrasebook|Galician]]''' (Galician: ''galego'', Castilian: ''gallego''), very closely related to Portuguese, Galician is spoken in [[Galicia]] and the western portions of [[Asturias]] and [[Leon (Spain)|Le\\u00f3n]]. Galician predates Portuguese and is deemed one of the four main dialects of the Galician-Portuguese language family group which includes Brazilian, Southern Portuguese, Central Portuguese, and Galician. While the Portuguese consider it a dialect of Portuguese, Galicians consider their language separate.\\n* '''[[Basque phrasebook|Basque]]''' (Basque: ''euskara'', Castilian: ''vasco''), a language unrelated to Castilian (or any other known language in the world), is spoken in the three provinces of the [[Basque Country]], on the two adjacent provinces on the French side of the Spain-French border, and in Navarre. Basque is considered a language isolate unrelated to any Romance, Indo-European, or even any known language, save for a weak theory that Basque could be related to Aquitanian.\\n* '''[[Asturiano phrasebook|Asturiano]]''' (Asturiano: ''asturianu'', Castilian: ''asturiano'', also known as ''bable''), spoken in the province of [[Asturias]], where it enjoys semi-official protection. It was also spoken in rural parts of [[Le\\u00f3n (Spain)|Le\\u00f3n]], [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]], [[Salamanca]], in a few villages in Portugal (where it is called Mirandes) and in villages in the extreme north of [[Extremadura]]. While the constitution of Spain explicitly protects Basque, Balearic-Catalan-Valencian under the term Catalan, Galician, and Castilian, it does not explicitly protect Asturian. Still, the province of Asturias explicitly protects it, and Spain implicitly protects it by not objecting before the Supreme Court.\\n* '''[[Aragonese phrasebook|Aragonese]]''' (Aragonese: ''aragon\\u00e9s'', Castilian: ''aragon\\u00e9s'', also known colloquially as ''fabla''), spoken in the north of [[Aragon]], and is not officially recognised. This language is close to Catalan (specially in [[Benasque]]) and to Castilian, with some Basque and Occitan (southern France) influences. Nowadays, only a few villages near the [[Pyrenees]] use the language vigorously, while most people mix it with Castilian in their daily speech.\\n* '''[[Aranese phrasebook|Aranese]]''' (Castilian: ''Aran\\u00e9s'', Catalan/Aranese Occitan: ''Aran\\u00e8s''), spoken in the Aran Valley and recognised as an official language of Catalonia (not of Spain), alongside Catalan and Castilian. This language is a variety of Gascon Occitan, and as such is very closely related to Proven\\u00e7al, Limousin, Languedoc, and Catalan.\\n\\nIn addition to the native languages, many languages such as English, [[French phrasebook|French]], and [[German phrasebook|German]] are commonly studied in school. However, Spaniards are not known for their proficiency in foreign languages, and it is very rare to find locals conversant in foreign languages outside of tourist establishments or major international hotels. Most establishments in Spain's important tourist industry, however, have staff members who speak a decent level of English, particularly in popular beach resorts such as those in the [[Costa del Sol]] where you will find people who are fluent in several languages, the most common ones being German and French. As [[Portuguese phrasebook|Portuguese]] and [[Italian phrasebook|Italian]] are closely related to Spanish, if you speak either of these languages, locals would be able to puzzle you out with some difficulty. German is spoken in some areas frequented by German tourists, such as Mallorca. In general, people who speak two national languages (e.g. Basque and Castilian or Catalan and Castilian) are more likely to speak a foreign language than monolingual Spanish speakers.\\n\\nCastilian Spanish differs from the '''Latin American Spanish''' varieties in pronunciation and grammar, although all Latin American varieties are easily understood by Spaniards and vice-versa. While the differences in spelling are virtually non-existent, the differences in vocabulary and pronunciation between Castilian Spanish and \\\"Latin American Spanish\\\" are arguably bigger than those between \\\"American\\\" and \\\"British\\\" English.\\n\\nFrench is the most widely understood foreign language in the northeast of Spain. The Basque region and northern Catalonia in particular have sizable populations that speak French.\\n\\nLocals will appreciate any attempts you make to speak their language. For example, know at least the Castilian for \\\"good morning\\\" (''buenos d\\u00edas'') and \\\"thank you\\\" (''gracias'').\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===Entry requirements===\\n{{infobox|Minimum validity of travel documents|* EU, EEA and Swiss citizens need only produce a passport or national identity card that is valid on the date of entry.\\n* Other nationals must produce a passport that is valid for the entirety of their stay in Spain.\\n* More information about the minimum validity of travel documents is on the [http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/MIAMI/en/InformacionParaExtranjeros/Pages/RequisitosDeEntrada.aspx Spanish government website].}}\\n{{Schengen}}\\n\\nIn addition, citizens of [[Andorra]] may enter and reside in Spain indefinitely without a visa.\\n\\nEU, EEA and Swiss nationals who enter Spain on a national identity card, who are under 18 years old and travelling without their parents are required to have written parental consent.\\n\\nCitizens of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Seychelles are permitted to work in Spain without the need to obtain a visa or any further authorisation for the period of their 90-day visa-free stay.

From neighbouring European countries, a drive with the car or a train ride is feasible; from a number of Mediterranean countries more or less [[Ferries in the Mediterranean|regular ferry connections]] are available; visitors from further away will probably be using air travel.\\n\\n===By plane===\\n[[File:Torre de control de Madrid-Barajas - 01.jpg|thumb|Control tower of [[Madrid\\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid-Barajas]]]]\\nSpain's flag carrier is '''[http://www.iberia.com Iberia]''', and its two other main airlines are '''[http://www.vueling.com Vueling]''' and '''[http://www.aireuropa.com Air Europa]'''. There are many airlines connecting from most European countries, Africa, the Americas and Asia. Virtually all European low cost carriers provide frequent services to Spain including: [https://www.tui.co.uk/flight/ '''TUI Airways'''], '''[http://www.easyjet.com EasyJet]''', '''[http://www.ryanair.com Ryanair]''', '''[http://wizzair.com Wizz Air]''' and '''[http://www.jet2.com Jet2.com]'''.\\n\\nThe busiest airports are [[Madrid\\u2013Barajas Airport]], [[Barcelona El Prat]], [[Palma de Mallorca#By plane|Palma de Mallorca]] and [[Malaga#By plane|Malaga]], followed by [[Seville#By plane|Seville]], [[Valencia#By plane|Valencia]], [[Bilbao#By plane|Bilbao]], [[Alicante#By plane|Alicante]] and [[Santiago de Compostela#By plane|Santiago de Compostela]].\\n\\nFor mainland Spain, Madrid Barajas ({{IATA|MAD}}), Barcelona ({{IATA|BCN}}) and Malaga ({{IATA|AGP}}) are your most likely ports of entry, as they have by far the highest number of international flights. For the islands, you will most likely directly arrive at an airport on the island, without connecting through another Spanish airport. If your destination does not have a direct flight, you can make use of Iberia's [[rail air alliance]] with Renfe. Searching for your destination directly on the Iberia website will give you flights with a connecting train service automatically.\\n\\nYou can also enter Spain by using an alternative airport not far away from the land border:\\n\\n* To the mainland's west: [[Porto#By plane|Porto]] ({{IATA|OPO}})\\n* To the mainland's south-west: [[Gibraltar#By plane|Gibraltar]] ({{IATA|GIB}}) and [[Faro#By plane|Faro]] ({{IATA|FAO}})\\n* To the mainlands's north: [[Biarritz]] ({{IATA|BIQ}}) and [[Perpignan]] ({{IATA|PGF}})\\n* To [[Ceuta]]: [[Tangier#By plane|Tangier]] ({{IATA|TNG}}) and [[T\\u00e9touan#By plane|T\\u00e9touan]] ({{IATA|TTU}})\\n* To [[Melilla]]: [[Nador#By plane|Nador]] ({{IATA|NDR}})\\n* To [[Lanzarote]]'s south: [[Fuerteventura#By plane|Fuerteventura]] ({{IATA|FUE}})\\n* To [[Fuerteventura]]'s north: [[Lanzarote]] ({{IATA|ACE}})\\n\\n===By train===\\n{{see also|rail travel in Europe}}\\n[[File:AVE in spain.jpg|thumb|AVE in Spain (Spanish High Speed)]]\\n\\nThe train system in Spain is modern and reliable, most of the trains are brand new and the punctuality rate is one of the highest in Europe, the only problem is that not all the populated areas have a train station; sometimes small towns don't have one, in those cases you need to take a bus. Another issue with the Spanish Rail network is that the lines are disposed in a radial way so almost all the lines head to Madrid. That's why sometimes travelling from one city to another geographically close to it might take longer by train than by bus if they are not on the same line. Always check whether the bus or the train is more convenient. The Spanish [[high speed rail]] system is, however, more reliable than that of - say - Germany, because the gauge of traditional and high speed trains is different and thus high speed lines are only used by high speed passenger trains meaning fewer delays due to congested lines or technical problems. All lines that cross the border into France have either a break of gauge (thus making changing train or a lengthy gauge change necessary) or are high speed, thus making the high speed trains the vastly preferable option to cross the border. Trains between Barcelona and France are operated jointly by '''SNCF''' and '''renfe''' and both sell tickets for any international train on that route. Spain has numerous rail links with neighbouring Portugal, none of them high speed. There are only three rail links with France, one at [[Hendaye]] on a traditional line requiring a break of gauge, a connection used for local traffic near Latour de Carol (this is the closest rail line to [[Andorra]]) and one near [[Figueres]] for high speed trains. The former two see the occasional [[sleeper train]] while the latter sees the vast majority of passenger travel and all high speed trains. The former link through the Pyrenees near [[Canfranc]] has been abandoned but the former border station at Canfranc is still served from the Spanish site and worth a visit if you're a railway enthusiast or history buff.\\n\\nLike many European countries there has been a separation between running trains and running infrastructure (including stations). The infrastructure company is called [https://www.adif.es/inicio adif] and their website has train operator independent information about their stations including platform and departure times. They also have a more travel focussed smart-phone app. Note that local trains and regional/longer distance services are listed separately.\\n\\n===By bus===\\n\\nGerman player [http://www.flixbus.de Flixbus] offer international routes to/from Spanish destinations. Spanish operators with international connections include [https://www.alsa.es/en/our-destinations/international Alsa] and [http://www.linebus.es/ Linebus]. Generally speaking the buses will be reasonably save and may even have WiFi or electric outlets at your seat, but if your main concern is anything but cost, opt for a train or plane instead as the former is both vastly more comfortable and faster and the latter is still a lot faster and can even be cheaper, if you manages to travel on carry-on only. Buses generally have greater luggage allowances than the airlines, but then again, you'd have the same advantage taking the train.\\n\\n===By boat===\\nSpain is a popular Cruise destination being some of is main cruise ports: [[Barcelona]], [[Bilbao]], [[Valencia]],  [[Palma de Mallorca]] or [[Malaga]]\\n\\nFrom the UK, [http://www.brittanyferries.com/ Brittany Ferries] offers services from [[Portsmouth]] and [[Plymouth (England)|Plymouth]] to [[Santander]] and from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Bilbao]].

Long-distance trains always run on time, but be aware that short-distance trains (called ''Cercan\\u00edas'') can have some delays, from ten to twenty minutes.  To be safe, always take the train before the one you need. It also runs former FEVE narrow-gauge trains which mainly run near the northern Atlantic coast (from Ferrol to Bilbao). Buying tickets online with a foreign credit card is usually possible, however, those with a PayPal account may find it easier to pay using the website. Renfe also operates the '''AVE''' [[High-speed rail|high speed trains]], whose network radiates out of Madrid to the major cities along the coasts - Spain boasts the second-longest high speed network (behind [[China]]) and has constructed a lot of new lines until the economic downturn at the end of the 2000s. The AVE is easily the fastest option wherever it goes (faster even than flying in most cases) but can be on the expensive side. '''Intercity''' trains are slower but often substantially cheaper, and much more comfortable than the bus.

You can also see what is all available on [http://www.movelia.es Movelia.es] or see \\\"By bus\\\" under \\\"Getting in\\\" or \\\"Getting Around\\\" in the article for a particular autonomous community region, province or locale.   It is usually not necessary or more advantageous to book tickets in advance as one can show up and get on the next available bus. Most bus companies can be booked in advance online. however English translation on their websites is patchy at best.\\n\\n===By boat===\\nRegular '''ferries''' travel from mainland Spain to the [[Balearic Islands]] (3-7h) and [[Canary Islands]] (36-40h).

The Canaries are served from [[Huelva]] and [[C\\u00e1diz|Cadiz]].\\n\\nWith a '''private yacht''' you can enjoy gorgeous scenery and distance yourself from the inevitable crowds of tourists that flock to these destinations. May is a particularly pleasant time to charter in the regions of Costa Brava, Costa Blanca and the Balearic Islands as the weather is good and the crowds have yet to descend. The summer months of July and August are the hottest and tend to have lighter winds. There is no low season for the Canary Islands, as the weather resembles springtime all year round.\\n\\nIf you would like to bareboat anywhere in Spain, including the Balearic or Canary Islands, a US Coast Guard License is the only acceptable certification needed by Americans to bareboat. For everyone else, a RYA Yacht Master Certification or International Certificate of Competence will normally do.\\n\\nAlthough a skipper may be required, a hostess/chef may or may not be necessary. Dining out is strong part of Spanish custom and tradition. If you are planning on docking in a port and exploring fabulous bars and restaurants a hostess/cook may just be useful for serving drinks and making beds. Extra crew can take up valuable room on a tight ship.\\n\\n=== By car ===\\n{{see also|Driving in Spain}}\\nIn major cities like [[Madrid]] or [[Barcelona]] and in mid-sized ones like [[San Sebastian]], moving around by car is expensive and nerve-wracking. Fines for improper parking are uncompromising (\\u20ac85 and up). Access by car has been made more difficult by municipal policies in Barcelona and Madrid in the 2010s. The positive effects on the urban fabric of those policies have proven widely popular, so expect more of this.\\n[[File:Red espa\\u00f1ola de autopistas y autov\\u00edas2.PNG|thumb|Spanish network of motorways]]\\nHaving a driving map is essential - many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable).\\n\\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to move from one city to another every other day, ideally if you don't plan to park overnight in large cities. It also doesn't hurt that the scenery is beautiful and well worth a drive. With a good public transport network that connects to (almost) all points of interest for travellers, you might ask yourself whether driving is really worth the cost and the hassle, as you are often much faster by train than by car.\\n\\nThere are two types of highway in Spain: ''autopistas'', or motorways, and ''autov\\u00edas'', which are more akin to expressways. Most autopistas are toll roads while autov\\u00edas are generally free of charge. In some autonomous communities whether a highway is tolled depends on whether the central or regional government built and operates them. To a foreigner the system can seem rather confusing. <!--is there signage at least?--> Tolls often work out to \\\"odd\\\" Euro amounts leading you with a lot of copper coins if you pay cash. Speed limits range from 50&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph) in towns to 90&nbsp;km/h on rural roads, 100&nbsp;km/h on roads and 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph) on autopistas and autov\\u00edas. Starting from May 2021 all roads with only one lane per direction inside built up areas will have a blanket speed limit of {{kmh|30}}.\\n\\nSpaniards are somewhat notorious for seeing traffic infractions such as speeding, second row parking or red light infractions as \\\"minor\\\", but the government is increasingly cracking down on this kind of behavior and police will have a field day writing a ticket to a foreigner who doesn't speak the language.\\n\\nGasoline/petrol costs in the range of \\u20ac1.60/L in Dec 2023, and diesel costs \\u20ac1.55/L.

Sometimes you can wait many hours. Try to speak with people at gas stations, parking lots, etc. They are scared and suspicious, but when you make them feel that they don't need to be afraid, they gladly accept you and mostly also show their generosity.\\n\\nIn the south of Spain, in and around the Alpujarras, hitchhiking is very common and it is also very easy to get a ride. As long as you can speak a bit of Spanish and don't look too dirty or frightening, you should be able to get a ride moderately easily.\\n\\n=== By bicycle ===\\n[[File:Bicisvalenbisi.jpg|thumb|Bike rental station in Valencia]]\\n\\nSpain is a suitable country for cycling, and it is possible to see many cyclists in some of the cities. Cycling lanes are available in a large part of North-Easter Catalonia, and elsewhere in mid-sized and large cities, although they are not comparable in number to what you can find in for example central Europe.\\n\\nDepending on where you are in Spain, you could face a very mountainous area. Much of central Spain is very flat, though elevated, but towards the coast the landscape is often very hilly, especially in the north. Consider using an E-bike if your visit involves going by hilltops and you aren't used to that kind of biking or don't like the effort needed.\\n\\nThere are several options for touring in Spain by bicycle: guided or supported tours, rent bicycles in Spain or bring your own bike, or any combination. Supported tours are ubiquitous on the web. For unsupported tours a little Spanish helps a lot. Shoulder seasons avoid extremes of temperature and ensure hotel availability in non-tourist areas. Good hotels are \\u20ac35\\u201345 in the interior, breakfast usually included. ''Men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' meals are \\u20ac8\\u201310 eating where the locals eat. Secondary roads are usually well paved and have good shoulders, and as a rule Spanish drivers are careful and courteous around touring cyclists. Road signs are usually very good and easy to follow.\\n\\nMost municipalities in Spain, towns and cities are modernising their streets to introduce special lanes for bicycles. Bike share systems with usually quite reasonable prices are also being installed in cities throughout the country.\\n\\n=== By e-hailing ===\\nSeveral cities in Spain are covered by Uber, Cabify, Bolt, Free Now and Pide Taxi{{go|lastedit=2024-05-19}}\\n\\n=== By taxi ===\\nAll the major cities in Spain are served by taxis, which are a convenient, if somewhat expensive way to get around. That being said, taxis in Spain are more reasonably priced than those in say, the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Japan]]. Most taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign languages, so it would be necessary to have the names and/or addresses of your destinations written in Spanish to show your taxi driver. Likewise, get your hotel's business card to show your taxi driver in case you get lost.\\n\\nAll taxis should have a visible fare table. You may be offered a fixed price to go from an airport to a city, but in most cases, the taxi driver will be earning more money than with the metered fare.\\n\\nMany taxi drivers will demand a tip from foreign customers and for airport drives. The tip is in no way mandatory. You may round up to the nearest euro though, see also [[#Tipping|Tipping]] below.\\n\\n==See==\\nThe most popular beaches are the ones along the Mediterranean coast, in the Balearic Islands and in the Canary Islands.

The country thus is blessed with a fantastic collection of historical landmarks \\u2014 in fact, it has the second largest number of UNESCO Heritage Sites and the largest number of World Heritage Cities of any nation in the world.\\n\\nIn the south of Spain, Andalusia holds many reminders of old Spain. '''[[Cadiz]]''' is regarded as one of the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in western Europe, with remnants of the Roman settlement that once stood here. Nearby, '''[[Ronda]]''' is a beautiful town atop steep cliffs and noted for its gorge-spanning bridge and the oldest bullring in Spain. '''[[Cordoba (city, Spain)|Cordoba]]''' and '''[[Granada (Spain)|Granada]]''' hold the most spectacular reminders of the nation's Muslim past, with the red-and-white striped arches of the Mezquita in Cordoba and the stunning Alhambra palace perched on a hill above Granada. '''[[Seville]]''', the cultural centre of Andalusia, has a dazzling collection of sights built when the city was the main port for goods from the Americas, the grandest of which being the city's cathedral, the largest in the country.\\n\\nMoving north across the plains of La Mancha into Central Spain, picturesque '''[[Toledo]]''' stands as perhaps ''the'' historical centre of the nation, a beautiful medieval city sitting atop a hill that once served as the capital of Spain before Madrid was built. North of Madrid and an easy day-trip from the capital city is '''[[El Escorial]]''', once the centre of the Spanish empire during the time of the Inquisition, and '''[[Segovia]]''', noted for its spectacular Roman aqueduct which spans one of the city's squares.\\n\\nFurther north in Castile-Leon is '''[[Salamanca]]''', known for its famous university and abundance of historic architecture. Galicia in northwestern Spain is home to '''[[Santiago de Compostela]]''', the end point of the old [[Way of St. James]] (''Camino de Santiago'') pilgrimage route and the supposed burial place of St. James, with perhaps the most beautiful cathedral in all of Spain at the heart of its lovely old town. Northeastern Spain has a couple of historical centres to note: '''[[Zaragoza]]''', with Roman, Muslim, medieval and Renaissance buildings from throughout its two thousand years of history, and '''[[Barcelona]]''' with its pseudo-medieval [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Barri G\\u00f2tic]] neighbourhood.\\n\\nBe prepared to have your luggage scanned airport style at the entrance of most museums. There's usually a locker where you can (or must) leave your bags.\\n\\n===Art museums===\\n[[File:Hemispheric - Valencia, Spain - Jan 2007.jpg|thumb|L'Hemisf\\u00e8ric, in The City of Arts and Sciences (Spanish: Ciudad de Las Artes y Las Ciencias) (Valencia)]]\\nSpain has played a key role in Western art, heavily influenced by French and Italian artists but very distinct in its own regard, owing to the nation's history of Muslim influence, Counter-Reformation climate and, later, the hardships from the decline of the Spanish empire, giving rise to such noted artists like El Greco, Diego Vel\\u00e1zquez and Francisco Goya. In the last century, Spain's unique position in Europe brought forth some of the leading artists of the Modernist and Surrealist movements, most notably the famed Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dal\\u00ed.\\n[[File:Museo Guggenheim con el puente de la Salve en primer plano.jpg|thumb|Guggenheim Museum with Salve Bridge in the foreground (Bilbao)]]\\nToday, Spain's two largest cities hold the lion's share of Spain's most famous artworks. Madrid's [[Madrid#Museum Triangle|Museum Triangle]] is home to the '''Museo del Prado''', the largest art museum in Spain with many of the most famous works by El Greco, Vel\\u00e1zquez, and Goya as well as some notable works by Italian, Flemish, Dutch and German masters. Nearby sits the '''Reina Sof\\u00eda''', most notable for holding Picasso's ''Guernica'' but also containing a number of works by Dal\\u00ed and other Modernist, Surrealist and abstract painters. The Prado goes back to the former royal collection and the Reina Sofia Museum is named for King Juan Carlos' wife, in practice the dividing line between the two is largely one of era, with anything made roughly after the birth of Picasso found in the Reina Sofia and everything else in the Prado.\\n\\n[[Barcelona]] is renowned for its stunning collection of modern and contemporary art and architecture. This is where you will find the '''Picasso Museum''', which covers the artist's early career quite well, and the architectural wonders of '''Antoni Gaudi''', with their twisting organic forms that are a delight to look at.\\n\\nOutside of Madrid and Barcelona, the art museums quickly dwindle in size and importance, although there are a couple of worthy mentions that should not be overlooked. Many of El Greco's most famous works lie in '''[[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]]''', an easy day trip from Madrid. ''The Disrobing of Christ'', perhaps El Greco's most famous work, sits in the cathedral, but you can also find work by him in one of the small art museums around town. [[Bilbao]] in the Basque Country of northern Spain is home to a spectacular '''Guggenheim Museum''' designed by Frank Gehry that has put the city on the map. A day trip from Barcelona is the town of [[Figueres]], noted for the '''Salvador Dal\\u00ed Museum''', designed by the Surrealist himself. [[M\\u00e1laga]] in the south is Picasso's city of birth, and is also home to two museums dedicated to his life and works.\\n\\n===Archaeological sites===\\n* Ampurias, excavations of a Greek and Roman town, Roman basilica, temples of Asclepios and Serapis, (between Gerona and Figueras, Catalonia)\\n* Antequetera, La Menga and Viera dolmens,\\n* Calatrava la Nueva, well preserved medieval castle,\\n* Calatrava la Vieja, remains of the Arab town, castle of the order of Calatrava,\\n* Clunia, Roman town with forum, shops, temple, public bath houses and Roman villa,\\n* Fraga, Roman villa, Bronze Age settlements,\\n* Gormaz, Arab castle,\\n* Italica, Roman town with amphitheatre, city walls, House of the Exedra, House of the Peacocks, Baths of the Moorish Queen, House of the Hylas, temple complex (near Sevilla),\\n* M\\u00e9rida, Roman city, Roman bridge, Amphitheatre, Hippodrome, House of the Amphitheatre, House of the Mithraeum with mosaics, aquaeducts, museum\\n* San Juan de los Banos, Visigoth church (between Burgos and Valladolid),\\n* San Pedro de la Nave, Visigoth church (near Zamora),\\n* Santa Maria de Melque, Visigoth church,\\n* Segobriga (Cabeza del Griego), Roman town, Visigoth church, museum (between Madrid and Albacete)\\n* Tarragona, Roman town with \\u201cCyclopean wall\\u201d, amphitheatre, hippodrome, form and triumphal arch,\\n\\n===Sports===\\n====Football====\\n{{see also|Association football in Europe}}\\nSpain's '''[http://www.laliga.es/en La Liga]''' is one of the strongest association football leagues in the world, boasting world-class teams like '''[http://www.realmadrid.com/en Real Madrid]''' and '''[https://www.fcbarcelona.com/ FC Barcelona]''' that play to sold-out crowds on a weekly basis. The rivalry between the two aforementioned clubs, known as '''''El Cl\\u00e1sico''''', is undoubtedly one of the most intense in the world as a result of the long history of political conflict behind it. Other noteworthy clubs include Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid, Valencia, Athletic Bilbao, and Sevilla. The Spanish national team is also one of the strongest in the world, being able to draw the best players from its league. It long had a reputation of always failing to win big games, but this reputation has been pretty much shattered by its wins in the 2008 and 2012 European Championships as well as the 2010 World Cup.\\n\\n====Basketball====\\nSpain also has a strong basketball tradition, with Spanish clubs generally doing well in European competition, and the Spanish national team also being one of the best in Europe. Many of the top football clubs in Spain also have basketball teams, and as with their football counterparts, both Real Madrid Baloncesto and FC Barcelona B\\u00e0squet are among Europe's most successful basketball teams.\\n\\n====Handball====\\n{{see also|Handball in Europe}}\\nSpain is among the most successful Handball nations on earth, although it may not always reach the level of play of some Nordic or ex-Yugoslavian countries or Germany.

There's a tradition in Spain to eat grapes as the clock counts down the New Year, one grape for each of the last 12 seconds before midnight. For this, even small packs of grapes (exactly 12 grapes per pack) are sold in supermarkets before New Year.\\n\\nLa Puerta del Sol, is the venue for the New Year's party in Spain. At 23:59 sound \\\"los cuartos (In Spanish)\\\" some bells announcing that it will begin to sound the 12 chimes (campanadas in Spanish). While sounding \\\"los cuartos\\\", moves down from the top chime of the clock, with the same purpose as \\\"los cuartos\\\" sound will indicate that \\\"las campanadas\\\". That will sound at 24:00 and that indicate the start of a new year. During each chime must eat a grape, according to tradition. Between each chime, there is a time span of three seconds.\\n\\n\\\"Las Campanadas\\\", are broadcast live on the main national TV channels, as in the rest of Spain, people are still taking grapes from home or on giant screens installed in major cities, following the chimes from the Puerta del Sol in Madrid.\\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|Start the New Year in La Puerta del Sol (Madrid)]]\\nAfter ringing \\\"las campanadas\\\", starts a fireworks extravaganza.\\nThis is a famous party in Spain and is a great time to enjoy because show is secured in the centre of the capital of Spain.\\n\\n===Outdoor activities===\\n* '''Canyoning''': see [[Canyoning#Spain|Spain section in the Canyoning article]]\\n* '''Climbing''' in: [[Los Mallos]] ([[Aragon]]) and [[Siurana]] (near [[Barcelona]])\\n* '''Football''' (soccer): The most popular sport in Spain, with both the Spanish league and national team being among the strongest in the world.\\n* '''Whitewater sports''' in: [[Campo]], [[Murillo de Gallego]] ([[Aragon]])\\n* '''Hiking''' in Galicia\\n* '''Downhill skiing''': There are a lot of downhill skiing resorts in Spain.\\n\\nSkiing in the northern region of Spain\\n\\n===Scuba diving===\\nFor a treat, try Costa Brava and the world renowned Canary Islands.\\n\\n==Work==\\nIf you are a citizen of an [[European Union#EEA|EEA]] country, Switzerland or Andorra, you may work in Spain without any restrictions whatsoever (see [[European Union#Work]]). Everyone else requires a work permit to work in Spain.\\n\\nEmployment matters are highly sensitive in Spain, especially for Spanish citizens. The country has a high level of unemployment (13.5% as of March 2022) and for a developed country, Spain's economy is notoriously fragile. The country has long suffered from high levels of unemployment and many Spaniards have emigrated to other countries in search of better opportunities.\\n\\nTourism is the country's most important economic sector, and foreigners may be able to find jobs there, but it was badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nSpain has a sunny climate and is one of Europe's largest agricultural exporters. Farmers are often looking for temporary workers, but this means really hard work and miserable pay.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n===Money===\\n{{Exchange rate euros}}\\n{{Euro}}\\n[[File:Banco de Espa\\u00f1a (Madrid) 06.jpg|thumb|Bank of Spain]]\\n\\n\\u20ac500 banknotes are not accepted in many stores&mdash;always have alternative banknotes.\\n\\n====Money exchange====\\nDo not expect anybody to accept currencies other than euros, or to be willing to exchange currency. Exceptions are shops and restaurants in airports, which will generally accept at least US dollars \\u2013 at a bad exchange rate.\\n\\nBanks are the main places to exchange money. However, some banks may only exchange money for those with an account there.\\n\\nCurrency exchanges, once a common sight, have all but disappeared since the introduction of the euro. Again, international airports are an exception to this rule; another exception is tourist districts in the large cities (Barcelona, Madrid).\\n\\n====Credit and debit cards====\\nCredit and debit cards are widely accepted.\\n\\nSome Spanish stores will ask for ID before accepting your credit card. Some stores may not accept a foreign driving licence or ID card, and you may need to show your passport. This measure is designed to help reduce credit card fraud.\\n\\n====ATM====\\nMost ATMs will allow you to withdraw money with your credit card. There is a fee in addition to what your bank charges you of about \\u20ac2-7 (Feb 2023), except with Unicaja Banco machines. After advising you of the fee, you may choose whether to continue. ATMs are abundant: You can just check the fees of 2-3 ATMs around and pick the one with the lowest fee.\\n\\n* Banc Sabadell - \\u20ac4.5 (2025-02)\\n* BBVA - \\u20ac7 (2025-03)\\n* Caixabank - \\u20ac7 (2025-02)\\n* Ibercaja - \\u20ac0 (2025-03)\\n* Santander - \\u20ac7 (2025-03)\\n\\n===Tipping===\\n[[Tipping]], or \\\"propina\\\" in Spanish, is not mandatory nor considered customary in Spain unless there was something absolutely exceptional about the service. As a result, you may find that waiters are not as attentive or courteous as you may be used to since they don't work for tips.  If you choose to tip, the tip amount in restaurants depends on your economic status, the locale and type of establishment. If you feel that you have experienced good service then leave some loose change on the table - possibly \\u20ac1  or \\u20ac2. If you don't, it is no big deal.\\n\\nBars expect only tourists, particularly American tourists, to leave a tip. They are aware that it is customary in the United States to leave a tip for every drink or meal. It is rare to see anyone other than Americans tipping in Spain. In major resorts tipping may be common; look around at other diners to assess if tipping is appropriate.\\n\\nOutside the restaurant business, some service providers, such as taxi drivers, hairdressers and hotel personnel may expect a tip in an upscale setting.\\n\\n===Business hours===\\nMost businesses (including most shops, but not restaurants) close in the afternoons around 13:30/14:00 and reopen for the evening around 16:30/17:00. Exceptions are large malls or major chain stores.\\n\\nFor most Spaniards, lunch is the main meal of the day and you will find bars and restaurants open during this time. On Saturdays, businesses often do not reopen in the evening and almost everywhere is closed on Sundays. The exception is the month of December, where most shops in Madrid and Barcelona will be open as per on weekdays on Sundays to cash in on the festive season. Also, many public offices and banks do not reopen in the evenings even on weekdays, so if you have any important business to take care of, be sure to check hours of operation.\\n\\nIf you plan to spend whole day shopping in small shops, the following rule of thumb can work: a closed shop should remind it's also time for your own lunch. And when you finish your lunch, some shops will be likely open again.\\n[[File:Gran V\\u00eda (Madrid) 25.jpg|thumb|Gran V\\u00eda of Madrid, is a perfect place for shopping]]\\n\\n===Shopping===\\n====Designer brands====\\nBesides well-known mass brands which are known around the world (Zara, Mango, Bershka, Camper, Desigual), Spain has many designer brands which are more hard to find outside Spain\\u2014and may be worth looking for if you shop for designer wear while travelling. Some of these brands include:\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Custo Barcelona | url=https://custo.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n|lastedit=2023-12-26| content=Headquartered in [[Barcelona]], has stores in [[Bilbao]], [[Ibiza]], [[La Coruna]], [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], [[Le\\u00f3n (Spain)|Le\\u00f3n]], [[Madrid]], [[Marbella]], [[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Salamanca]], [[Tenerife]].\\n}}\\n\\n====Chains====\\n* {{buy\\n| name=El Corte Ingles | alt= | url=http://elcorteingles.es | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Major national chain that can be found in nearly every city.

Spanish food can be described as quite light with a lot of vegetables and a huge variety of meat and fish. Perhaps owing to the inquisition trying to \\\"find out\\\" lapsed ''conversos'' pork (religiously prohibited in both Judaism and Islam) is easily the most consumed meat and features prominently in many dishes. Spanish cuisine does not use many spices; it relies only on the use of high quality ingredients to give a good taste. As such, you may find Spanish food bland at times but there are usually a variety of restaurants in most cities (Italian, Chinese, American fast food) if you would like to experience a variety of flavors. If you are familiar with Latin American cuisines, keep in mind that many Spanish dishes may have the same name as several Latin American dishes, but actually refer to completely different dishes (e.g. ''tortilla'', ''horchata'' and ''mazap\\u00e1n'' refer to completely different things in Spain and Mexico).\\n\\nLike much of Europe, Spain's top tourism destinations are full of tourist-trap restaurants that serve overpriced and mediocre food. If you want a good and reasonably-priced meal, it's generally best to go to restaurants with a primarily local clientele. However, as it is rare to find English-speaking waiters in such establishments, be prepared to have to speak some Spanish.\\n\\n===Breakfast, lunch and dinner times===\\nSpaniards have a different eating timetable than many people are used to.\\n\\nThe key thing to remember for a traveller is:\\n* breakfast ('''desayuno''') for most Spaniards is light and consists of just coffee and perhaps a ''galleta'' (like a graham cracker) or ''magdalena'' (sweet muffin-like bread).  Later, some will go to a cafe for a pastry midmorning, but not too close to lunchtime.\\n* \\\"el aperitivo\\\" is a light snack eaten around 12:00. However, this could include a couple of glasses of beer and a large filled baguette or a \\\"pincho de tortilla\\\".[[File:TapasenBarcelona.JPG|thumb|\\\"Pinchos\\\" in Barcelona]]\\n* lunch ('''comida''') starts at 13:30-14:30 (though often not until 15:00) and was once typically followed by a short siesta, usually at summer when temperatures can be quite hot in the afternoon.  This is the main meal of the day with two courses ('''el primer plato''' and '''el segundo plato''' followed by dessert.  ''La comida'' and siesta are usually over by 16:00 at the latest. However, since life has become busier, there is no opportunity for a siesta.\\n* dinner ('''cena''') starts at 20:30 or 21:00, with most client\\u00e8le coming after 21:00. It is a lighter meal than lunch. In Madrid restaurants rarely open before 21:00 and most customers do not appear before 23:00.\\n* there is also an afternoon snack that some take between ''la comida'' and ''la cena'' called '''merienda'''.  It is similar to a tea time in England and is taken around 18:00 or so.\\n* between the lunch and dinner times, most restaurants and cafes are closed, and it takes extra effort to find a place to eat if you missed lunch time. Despite this, you can always look for a ''bar'' and ask for a ''bocadillo'', a baguette sandwich. There are ''bocadillos fr\\u00edos'', cold sandwiches, which can be filled with ham, [[cheese]] or any kind of ''embutido'', and ''bocadillos calientes'', hot sandwiches, filled with pork loin, ''tortilla'', bacon, sausage and similar options with cheese. This can be a really cheap and tasty option if you find a good place.\\n\\nNormally, restaurants in big cities don't close until midnight during the week and 02:00-03:00 during the weekend.\\n\\n===Breakfast===\\n[[File:Chocolate with churros.jpg|thumb|right|230px|\\\"''Chocolate con churros''\\\"]]\\nBreakfast is eaten by most Spaniards. Traditional Spanish breakfast includes coffee or orange juice, and pastries or a small sandwich. In Madrid, it is also common to have hot chocolate with \\\"churros\\\" or \\\"porras\\\". In cafes, you can expect varieties of ''tortilla de patatas'' (see the [[#Spanish dishes|''Spanish dishes'' section]]), sometimes tapas (either breakfast variety or same kind as served in the evenings with alcohol).\\n\\n===Tapas===\\n[[File:Tapas marte\\u00f1as.jpg|thumb|Spanish Tapas]]\\nThe entry level to Spanish food is found in bars as '''tapas''', which are a bit like \\\"starters\\\" or \\\"appetisers\\\", but are instead considered side orders to accompany your drink; in some parts of Spain, a drink is still accompanied automatically by a free tapa, but in places where it's not, ask for ''tapa y ca\\u00f1a'' to order a beer and a tapa. Some bars will offer a wide variety of different tapas; others specialise on a specific kind (like seafood-based). A Spanish custom is to have one tapa and one small drink at a bar, then go to the next bar and do the same.  A group of two or more individuals may order two or more '''tapas''' or order '''raciones''' instead, which are a bit larger in order to share.\\n\\n===Types of dishes===\\n\\n'''Seafood''' (''mariscos''): on the coast, fresh seafood is widely available and quite affordable. In the inner regions, frozen (and poor quality) seafood can be frequently encountered outside few highly reputed (and expensive) restaurants. In coastal areas seafood deserves some attention, especially on the north Atlantic coast.\\n\\nQuality seafood in Spain comes from Spain's northwestern region of Galicia. So restaurants with the words ''Gallego'' (Galician) will generally specialise in seafood. If you are feeling adventurous,  you might want to try the Galician regional specialty ''Pulpo a la Gallega'', which is boiled octopus served with paprika, rock salt and olive oil. Another adventurous option is ''Sepia'' which is cuttlefish, a relative of squid, or the various forms of ''Calamares'' (squid) that you can find in most seafood restaurants. If that isn't your style you can always order ''Gambas Ajillo'' (garlic shrimp), ''Pescado Frito'' (fried fish), ''Bu\\u00f1uelos de Bacalao'' (breaded and deep fried cod) or the ever-present ''Paella'' dishes.\\n\\n'''Meat products''' are usually of very good quality, because Spain has maintained quite a high percentage of free range animals.\\n\\nOrdering beef steaks is highly recommended, since most come from free range cows from the mountains.\\n\\nPork cuts which are also highly coveted are those known as ''presa ib\\u00e9rica'' and ''secreto ib\\u00e9rico'', an absolute must if found in the menu of any restaurant.\\n\\n'''Soups''': the choice of soups beyond gazpacho is very limited in Spanish restaurants.\\n\\n===Restaurants===\\n'''Water''' (''agua'') is frequently served without a specific request, and is normally charged for, unless it's included in your ''menu del dia''. If you would like free tap water instead of bottled water, ask for ''agua del grifo''. However, not all restaurants will offer this and you may be forced to order bottled water.\\n\\n'''Appetisers''' such as bread (''pan''), cheese (''queso''), and other items may be brought to your table even if you didn't order them. You may still be charged for them. If you do not want these appetisers, politely inform the waiter that you do not want them.\\n\\n'''World-famous restaurants''': There are several restaurants in Spain which are destinations in themselves, becoming a sole reason to travel to a specific city. One of them is ''El Celler de Can Roca'' in [[Girona]].\\n\\n==== Fast food====\\nFast food has not yet established a strong grip on the Spaniards and you will find McDonalds and Burger King only in bigger towns in the usual places. That said, Madrid and other large Spanish cities are often the first place for North American chains to dip their toe into the European market and you'll find Taco Bell, TGI Friday's or Five Guys there but not or only rarely in central European cities. The menu can be a surprise since it has been customised to appeal to the locals and beer, salads, yogurt (primarily Danone), and wine are prominent. Pizza is increasingly popular and you will find some outlets in bigger towns but it can be their own homegrown franchises, such as TelePizza. In spite of beer and wine on the menu, fast food is often seen as \\\"kiddie food.\\\" American franchises generally charge higher prices than in the United States, and fast food is not necessarily the cheapest alternative for eating out.\\n\\n====Service charges and VAT====\\n\\nNo '''service charges''' are included in the bill. A little extra tip is common and you are free to increase that if you are very pleased. Obviously you don't have to tip a lousy waiter. You would typically leave the small change after paying with a note.\\n\\n====Men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda====\\n\\nMany restaurants offer a complete lunch meal for a fixed price &ndash; ''men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' &ndash; and this often works out as a bargain. Water or wine (''vino'') is commonly included in the price.\\n\\n====Non-Spanish cuisine====\\n\\nThings like schnitzel, full English breakfast, pizza, d\\u00f6ner, and frozen fish are largely available in tourist destinations. In most cities you can also find international cuisine such as Italian, Chinese, French, Thai,  Japanese, Middle Eastern, Vietnamese, and Argentinian. The bigger the city, the more variety you can find.\\n\\nUnlike some northern European countries, Spain received very little immigration until after the death of Franco and the 1980s economic boom and as such there may be less variety of immigrant-owned restaurants in small- and medium-sized towns, but this is of course changing with particularly Latin American and Middle Eastern immigration to Spain leaving their mark on the restaurant scene.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n{{see also|Spanish cuisine#Beverages}}\\n=== Tea and coffee ===\\nSpanish people are very passionate about the quality, intensity  and taste of their [[coffee]] (''caf\\u00e9'') and good freshly brewed coffee is available almost everywhere.\\n\\nThe usual choices are '''solo''', the milk-less espresso version; '''cortado''', solo with a dash of milk; '''con leche''', solo with milk added; and '''manchado''', coffee with lots of milk (sort of like the French ''cafe au lait''). Asking for ''caffee latte'' will likely result in less milk than you are used to\\u2014it's always OK to ask for extra milk.\\n\\nRegional variants can be found, such as '''bomb\\u00f3n''' in Eastern Spain, solo with condensed milk.\\n\\n'''[http://www.starbucks.es Starbucks]''' is the only national chain operating in Spain. Locals argue that it cannot compete with small local cafes in quality of coffee and visited only by tourists. It is not present in smaller cities.\\n\\nIf you eat for \\u20ac20 per dinner, you will never be served a good tea; expect Pompadour or Lipton. It takes some effort to find a good tea if you spend most time of the day in touristy places.\\n\\n'''Horchata''' is a milky non-alcoholic drink made of tiger nuts and sugar, and very different from drinks of the same name found in [[Latin America]]. [[Alboraia]], a small town close to [[Valencia]], is regarded as a best place where horchata is produced.\\n\\n===Alcohol===\\nThe drinking age in Spain is 18. People under this age are forbidden to drink and buy alcoholic drinks, although enforcement in tourist and clubbing areas is lax. Drinking in the streets has been banned (although it is still a common practice in most nightlife areas). A \\\"dry law\\\" bans supermarkets from selling alcohol after 22:00.\\n\\nTry an absinthe cocktail (the fabled liquor was never outlawed here, but it is not a popular drink in Spain).\\n\\n===Bars===\\n\\nProbably one of the best places to meet people in Spain is in bars. Everyone visits them and they are always busy and sometimes bursting with people. There is no age restriction imposed to enter these premises, but children and teenagers often will not be served alcoholic drinks.  Age restrictions for the consumption of alcohol are clearly posted at bars but are enforced only intermittently. It is common to see an entire family at a bar.\\n\\nIt's important to know the difference between a pub (which closes at 3-03:30) and a club (which opens until 06:00-08:00 but is usually deserted early in the night).\\n\\nOn weekends, the time to go out for ''copas'' (drinks) usually starts at about 23:00-01:00 which is somewhat later than in North and Central Europe. Before that, people usually do any number of things, have some tapas (''raciones'', ''algo para picar''), eat a \\\"real\\\" dinner in a restaurant, stay at home with family, or go to cultural events. If you want to go dancing, you will find that most of the clubs in Madrid are relatively empty before midnight (some do not even open until 01:00) and most won't get crowded until 03:00. People usually go to pubs, then go to the clubs until 06:00-08:00.\\n\\nFor a true Spanish experience, after a night of dancing and drinking it is common to have a breakfast of ''chocolate con churros'' with your friends before going home. (''CcC'' is a small cup of thick, melted chocolate served with freshly fried sweet fritters used for dipping in the chocolate and should be tried, if only for the great taste.)\\n\\nBars are mainly to have drink and a small ''tapa'' while socialising and decompressing from work or studies. Usually Spaniards can control their alcohol consumption better than their northern European neighbours and drunken people are rarely seen at bars or on the streets.  A drink, if ordered without an accompanying tapa, is often served with a \\\"minor\\\" or inexpensive tapa as a courtesy.\\n\\nSize and price of tapas changes a lot throughout Spain. For instance, it's almost impossible to get free tapas in big cities like Valencia or Barcelona, excluding Madrid where there are several Tapa Bars although some are a bit expensive. You can eat for free (just paying for the drinks), with huge tapas and cheap prices at cities like Granada, Badajoz or Salamanca.\\n\\nThe tapa, and the related pincho, trace their existence in Spain to both acting as a cover (\\\"Tapa\\\") on top of a cup of wine to prevent flies from accessing it, and as a requirement of law when serving wine at an establishment during the Middle Ages.\\n\\n===Alcoholic beverages===\\n[[File:Wine on tap, Spar, Girona.jpg|thumb|Cheap vermouth and red wine at a supermarket in [[Catalonia]]. Bring your own bottle!]]\\nThe Spanish '''[[Beer (beverage)|beer]]''' is well worth a try. Most popular local brands include San Miguel, Cruzcampo, Mahou, \\u00c1mbar, Estrella Galicia, Keller and many others, including local brands at most cities; import beers are also available.\\nSpaniards often add lemon juice (Fanta lim\\u00f3n, or lemon Fanta) to their beer. Particularly on hot summer days people will drink a refreshing \\\"clara\\\" which is a light beer mixed with lemon/lemonade.\\n\\n'''Cava''' is Spanish sparkling wine. The Spanish used to call it ''champan'', but the French argued that champagne can be made only from grapes grown in the [[Champagne|Champagne region]]. Nevertheless, Cava is a very successful sparkling wine, with 99% of the nation's production coming from the area around [[Barcelona]]. '''Cider''' (Sidra) can be found in the [[Galicia]], [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]] and [[Basque Country|Pa\\u00eds Vasco]].\\n\\nSpain is a country with great '''[[wine]]'''-making and drinking traditions: 22% of Europe's wine growing area is in Spain, however the production is about half of what the French produce. For red wine in a bar, ask \\\"un tinto por favor\\\", for white wine \\\"un blanco por favor\\\", for rose: \\\"un rosado por favor\\\". '''Wine bars''' proper are more and more popular. In short, a wine bar is a sophisticated tapas bar where you can order wine by the glass. You will see a blackboard with the wines that are available and the price per glass.\\n\\n'''Sangria''' is drink made of wine and fruits and usually is made from cheaper wines. You will find sangria in areas frequented by tourists. Spanish prepare sangria for fiestas and hot summer, and not every day as seen in tourist regions like [[Mallorca]]. Sangria in restaurants aimed for foreigners are best avoided, but it is a very good drink to try if a Spaniard prepares it for a fiesta!\\n\\nThe pale '''sherry''' wine around Jerez called \\\"fino\\\" is fortified with alcohol to 15 percent. If you would like to have one in a bar you have to order a ''fino''. Manzanilla is bit salty, good as an aperitivo. Amontillado and Oloroso are a different types of sherry where the oxidative aging process has taken the lead.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n{{infobox|What's the difference?|There are three names for hotel-like accommodation in large cities in Spain: ''hotel'', ''hostal'' and ''pension''. It is important not to confuse a hostel with a ''hostal''; a host'''e'''l offers backpacker-type accommodation with shared rooms, whereas a ''host'''a'''l'' is very similar to a guest house and is generally cheaper than a hotel.}}\\n\\nThere are many types of tourist accommodation, ranging from hotels, pensions, rented villas and [[vacation homes]], to camping and even monasteries.\\n\\n\\\"7% VAT is not included\\\" is a common trick for mid-range guesthouses and hotels: always check the small print when you choose your place to stay. VAT is IVA in Spanish.\\n\\n===Small villages===\\nBesides the coasts, Spain is rich in small tourist-friendly ''inland'' villages, like [[Alquezar]]: with narrow medieval streets, charming silence and isolation, still good selection of affordable restaurants and accommodation.\\n\\n===Casa rural, the [[bed and breakfast]] of Spain===\\n\\nFor a more homely sort of accommodation consider the casa rural. A casa rural is the rough equivalent to a bed and breakfast or a g\\u00eete. Not all houses are situated in the countryside, as the name implies. Some are situated in the smaller towns, and they are in virtually every province.\\n\\nCasas rurales vary in quality and price throughout Spain. In some regions, like [[Galicia]], they are strictly controlled and inspected. Other regions are not so thorough in applying their regulations.\\n\\n===Hotels===\\n\\nMany foreign visitors stay in hotels that have been organised by tour operators who offer package holidays to the popular resorts on the costas and islands. However, for the independent traveller, there are hotels all over the country in all categories and to suit every budget. In fact, due to the well developed internal and foreign tourism markets Spain may well be one of the best served European countries in terms of numbers and quality of hotels.\\n\\n===Paradores===\\nA [http://www.parador.es/ ''parador''] is a state-owned hotel in Spain (rating from 3 to 5 stars). This chain of inns was founded in 1928 by the Spanish King Alfonso XIII. The unique aspects of paradores are their location and their history. Found mostly in historical buildings, such as convents, Moorish castles (like [[La Alhambra]]), or haciendas, paradores are the exact opposite of the uncontrolled development found in coastal regions like the [[Costa del Sol]]. Hospitality has been harmoniously integrated with the restoration of castles, palaces and convents, rescuing from ruin and abandonment monuments representative of Spain's historical and cultural heritage.\\n[[File:Parador Santo Estevo, Nogueira de Ramu\\u00edn.jpg|thumb|Parador de Santo Estevo, in the province of Orense (Galicia)]]\\nFor example, the parador in Santiago de Compostela is located next to the cathedral in a former royal hospital built in the year 1499. Rooms are decorated in an old-fashioned way, but nevertheless have modern facilities. Other notable paradores are in [[Arcos de la Frontera]], [[Ronda]], [[Santillana del Mar]] (Altamira cave) as well as more than one hundred other destination all over Spain.\\n\\nParadores serve breakfast (about \\u20ac10) and often have very good local cuisine typical of their region (about \\u20ac25).\\n\\nAccommodation prices are good value, when you consider that the hotels are often found in the heart of scenic areas, varying from \\u20ac85 for a double room to \\u20ac245 for a twin room (like in [[Granada (Spain)|Granada]]). Two of the most beautiful paradors are in [[Leon (Spain)|L\\u00e9on]] and [[Santiago de Compostela]].\\n\\nThere are some promotions available:\\n* Over 60 year-olds can enjoy a discount.\\n* Youngsters under 30 can visit the paradors at a fixed rate of \\u20ac35 per person.\\n* Two nights half board have a discount of 20%.\\n* A dreamweek of 6 nights is cheaper.\\n* 5 nights at \\u20ac42 per person.\\n\\nThe promotions do not always apply, especially in August they are not valid, and may require advance bookings.\\n\\n===Hostels===\\nThere are plenty of [[hostels]]. Prices vary from \\u20ac15 to \\u20ac25 per night. Spanish \\\"hostales\\\" are not really hostels, but more like unclassified small hotels (with generally no more than a dozen rooms). They can vary in quality from very rudimentary to reasonably smart.\\n* {{sleep\\n| name=Independent-hotels.info Spain | alt= | url=http://independent-hotels.info/spain/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| price= | checkin= | checkout=\\n| content= includes a fair number of good value independent hostales among the hotel listings.\\n}}\\n* {{sleep\\n| name=Xanascat | alt= | url=http://www.xanascat.cat | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| price= | checkin= | checkout=\\n| content=The Regional Network of Youth Hostels of Catalonia if you are visiting Barcelona, Girona, Taragona or other locations in the region.\\n}}\\n\\n===Apartment rental===\\nShort-term, self-catering apartment rental is an option for travellers who want to stay in one place for a week or more. Accommodations range from small apartments to villas.\\n\\nThe number of holiday rentals available depends on the area of Spain you are planning to visit. Although they are common in coastal areas, big capitals and other popular tourist cities, if you plan to visit small inland towns, you will find casas rurales more easily.\\n\\n===Camping===\\nCamping is the least expensive lodging option.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nAs per rest of the [[European Union#Stay safe|European Union]], all emergencies can be reported to the toll-free number '''112'''.\\n\\n===Police===\\n[[File:2019 09 19 Cotxe de la Policia nacional aparcat sobre pas de vianants i carril bici 01.jpg|thumb|Police car of the National Police]]\\n[[File:La Palma - El Paso - Calle Paso de Abajo 04 ies.jpg|thumb|Police car of the Guardia Civil]]\\nThere are four kinds of police in Spain:\\n\\n* ''Polic\\u00eda Municipal'' or ''Local'' (municipal/local police), In [[Barcelona]]: Guardia Urbana. Uniforms change from town to town, but they usually wear black or blue clothes with pale blue shirt and a blue cap (or white helmet) with a checkered white-and-blue strip. Local police keeps order and rules the traffic inside cities, and they can help in case you are lost and need some directions. Although you can't directly report [[crime]]s to them, they will escort you to the local ''Policia Nacional'' headquarters if required, and they will escort the suspects to be arrested also, if needed.\\n* ''Polic\\u00eda Nacional'' (National Police) wear dark blue clothes and blue cap (sometimes replaced by a baseball-like cap), unlike Polic\\u00eda Municipal, they do not have a checkered flag around their cap/helmet. Inside cities, all offenses/crimes should be reported to them, although the other police forces would help anyone who needs to report an offense.\\n* ''Guardia Civil'' (Civil Guard) keeps the order outside cities, in the country, and regulates traffic in the roads between cities. You would probably see them guarding official buildings, or patrolling the roads. They wear plain green military-like uniform; for ceremonial duties, officers wear a black hat (''tricornio'') resembling a toreador cap, a tradition dated back to the 19th century, but most of them use green caps or white motorcycle helmets. The Guardia Civil likes to project a \\\"tough guy\\\" image and they are sometimes accused of excessive use of force.\\n* Given that Spain has a high grade of political autonomy granted to its regional governments, four of them have created regional law forces: the Polic\\u00eda Foral in Navarre, the Ertzaintza in the Basque Country, the Polic\\u00eda Canaria on the Canary Islands or the Mossos d'Esquadra in Catalonia. These forces have the almost the same competences as the Polic\\u00eda Nacional in their respective territories. Additionally there is BESCAM (Brigadas Especiales de Seguridad de la Comunidad Aut\\u00f3noma de Madrid) in the Madrid region which sit somewhere between local police and a fully autonomous police of an autonomous region but carry their own uniforms and livery on vehicles.\\n\\nAll kinds of police also wear high-visibility clothing (\\\"reflective\\\" jackets) while directing traffic, or in the road.\\n\\nSome thieves have been known to pose as police officers, asking to see wallets for identification purposes. If approached by someone claiming to be a police officer only show only your ID after the person has presented theirs; do not show your wallet or other valuables.\\n\\nIf you are a victim of crime call 112. You can ask for a copy of the \\u201cdenuncia\\u201d (police report) if you need it for insurance purposes, or to apply for replacement documents.  Make sure that it is a \\u201cuna denuncia\\u201d not a sworn declaration (una declaraci\\u00f3n judicial), as the latter may not be accepted as evidence of the crime for insurance purposes, or when applying for your new passport.\\n\\n====Making a police report====\\n\\nYou can make a police report in three different ways:\\n\\n1. In person.  A list of police stations in the different regions of Spain is available here. English language interpreters are not always available at short notice: it may be advisable to bring a Spanish-speaking person with you.\\n\\n2. By telephone: You can make a police report by phone in English {{phone|+34 901 102 112}}. The English language service is available 09:00-21:00, seven days a week. Once you have made your report, you will be instructed to pick up a signed copy of the report at your nearest police station. However, some crimes, particularly more serious crimes or those involving violence, can only be reported in person.\\n\\n3. Online: You can also make a police report online, but in Spanish only. Some crimes, especially more serious crimes involving physical violence, must be reported in person.\\n\\n=== Permissions and documentation ===\\n\\n[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-3442 Spanish law] strictly requires foreigners who are in Spanish territory to have documentation proving their identity and the fact of being legally in Spain. You must have that with you all the time because you may be asked by the Police to show those at any moment. If you don't carry it with you, you may be escorted to the nearest police station for identification.\\n\\n===Safety===\\n\\nSpain is a safe country, but there are certain security risks specific to Spain.\\n\\n* Large cities like Alicante, Barcelona, Madrid, and Sevilla, in particular, report many incidents of pick-pocketing, mugging, and violent attacks, some of which require the victim to seek medical attention. Although crimes occur at all times of day and night and to people of all ages, older and Asian tourists seem to be particularly at risk.\\n* In Madrid and also in Barcelona, criminals often target people from East Asia (especially China, S. Korea, Japan, and Taiwan), thinking they carry money and are easy prey.\\n\\n[[File:Barcelona (4624904973).jpg|thumb|View of Barcelona]]\\n\\n* Beware of [[pickpockets]] and thieves, especially in Madrid and Barcelona.\\n* Theft from rental vehicles is high. Be vigilant in service areas on the highways along the coast. Avoid leaving any luggage or valuables in the vehicle and use secure parking facilities.\\n* Avoid women offering rosemary, refuse it always; they will read your future, ask for some money, and your pocket will probably be picked. Some women will also approach you on the street repeating \\\"Buena suerte\\\" (\\\"good luck\\\") as a distraction for another woman to try to pickpocket you.\\n* More foreign passports are stolen each year in Spain than anywhere else in the world, especially in Barcelona. Ensure that your passport is protected at all times.\\n* In the event of a road-related incident, exercise extreme caution and do not accept help from anyone other than a uniformed Spanish police officer or Civil Guard in a marked vehicle. Thieves in Spain have been known to fake or provoke a flat tire on their own vehicles, and when a motorist stops to help them, the thieves steal the motorist's car or belongings. The reverse scenario has also occurred, whereby a fake Good Samaritan stops to help a motorist in distress, only to steal the motorist's car or belongings. There have been reports of thieves damaging rental cars departing major cities (especially Barcelona) in order to induce flat tires in rural areas where tourists can be more easily attacked.\\n\\n===Scams===\\n{{See also|Common scams}}\\nSome people could try to take advantage of your ignorance of local customs.\\n\\n* In Spanish cities, all taxis should have a visible fare table. Do not agree a fixed price to go from an airport to a city: in most cases, the taxi driver will be earning more money than without a preagreed tariff. Many taxi drivers will also demand a tip from foreign customers or even from national ones on the way to and from the airport. You might round up to the nearest euro when paying though.\\n* In many places of Madrid, especially near Atocha station, and also in the Ramblas of [[Barcelona]], there are people ('trileros') who play the \\\"shell game\\\". They will \\\"fish\\\" you if you play, and they will most likely pick your pocket if you stop to see other people play.\\n* Before paying the bill in bars and restaurants, always check the bill and carefully scrutinise it. Some staff will often attempt to squeeze a few extra euros out of unsuspecting tourists by charging for things they did not eat or drink, or simply overcharging. This is true in both touristy and non-touristy areas. If you feel overcharged, bring it to their attention and/or ask to see a menu. It is also sometimes written (in English only) at the bottom of a bill that a tip is not included: remember that tipping is optional in Spain and Spanish people commonly leave loose change only and no more than a 5%\\u20138% of the price of what they have consumed (not an American-style 15\\u201320%), so avoid being fooled into leaving more.\\n* Many tourists have reported lottery scams whereby they are contacted via the Internet or fax and informed that they have won a substantial prize in the Spanish lottery (El Gordo), when in fact they have never participated in the lottery. They are asked to deposit an amount of money in a bank account to pay taxes and other fees before collecting the prize or coming to Spain to close the transaction.\\n* There have also been reports of a scam whereby a person is informed that he or she is the recipient of a large inheritance, and that funds must be deposited into a Spanish bank account so the inheritance can be processed.\\n* In another common scam, some tourists have received a bogus email purportedly sent from an individual well known to them and claiming that he or she is in trouble and needs funds.\\n\\n===Other things you should know===\\n\\n* Spanish cities can be '''loud at night''', especially on weekends, but the streets are generally safe even for women.\\n* All businesses should have an official '''complaint form''', in case you need it. It is '''illegal''' for a business to deny you this form.\\n* In some cases, police in Spain may target people belonging to ethnic minorities for '''identity checks'''. People who are not \\\"European-looking\\\" can be stopped several times a day to have their papers checked on the pretext of \\\"migration control\\\".\\n* There has been an increase in political action and '''public demonstrations''' on a rolling basis throughout Spain. Demonstrations occur and have sometimes turned violent, mostly to police officers. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media. Strikes may occasionally lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. When a demonstration is planned or in progress you should seek advice on and avoid the routes marchers plan to take. You should also ensure to check for travel updates or transport delays before and during your trip to Spain.<!--\\n-->[[File:The evening rush.jpg|thumb|Evening rush in Madrid]]\\n* '''Driving''' in Spain can be dangerous due to traffic congestion in urban areas, although driving is not particularly aggressive with the exception of common speeding. Be cautious when driving in Spain. Night driving can be particularly dangerous. The use of a mobile phone without a hands-free device can result in a fine and you being banned from driving in Spain. All drivers are required to carry, in the vehicle, a reflective vest and to use a reflective triangle warning sign if they need to stop at the roadside.\\n* Be cautious when approached by someone who '''claims to be a police''' officer. On the road, you will always be stopped by an officer in a uniform. Unmarked vehicles will have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window which reads ''Polic\\u00eda'' or ''Guardia Civil'', and either ''Ertzaintza'' if in the Basque Country, or ''Mossos d'Esquadra'' if in Catalonia, or ''Foruzaingoa/Polic\\u00eda Foral'' in Navarre. Most times they will have blue flashing lights incorporated into the headlights. In non-traffic-related matters police officers may be in casual clothes. Police officers do not have to directly identify themselves unless you ask them to. Should they request identification, they should be shown photographic ID. Your passport or your driver's licence will do, or your national ID card if you are from the European Union, though a passport is always preferred. You can get in trouble or be fined for not having any identification on you. If in any doubt, drivers should converse through the car window and contact the Guardia Civil on 062 or the Spanish National Police on 112 and ask them to confirm that the registration number of the vehicle corresponds to an official police vehicle.\\n\\n=== Drugs ===\\nYou can smell marijuana smoke at many street corners in major cities with police apparently unperturbed by it. Still, if you don't know local customs, it is quite possible that the police make a show of enforcing the law on you.\\n\\nThe consumption of alcoholic beverages in the street, or when it seriously disrupts public tranquillity is fined up to \\u20ac600.\\n\\nThese rules are actively enforced.\\n\\n==Stay healthy==\\n\\n===Healthcare===\\n* Pharmaceuticals are not sold at supermarkets, only at ''farmacias'' (pharmacies/chemists), identified with a green cross or a Hygeia's cup. Nearly every city and town has at least one 24-hour pharmacy; for those that close at  night, the law requires  a poster with the address of the nearest pharmacy, possibly in one of the nearby streets or towns.\\n* People from the European Union and a few more European countries can freely use the public health system, if they have the appropriate European Health Insurance Card. The card does not cover treatment in private hospitals. Agreements are established to treat people from a few American countries.\\n* Do not hesitate to '''go to any healthcare facility''' should you be injured or seriously ill, as it would be illegal for them not to treat you, even if you are uninsured. You (or your country if Spain has a treaty on the matter) will pay for the service later.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n* Although many visitors travel to Spain for the warm climate, it can be cold in winter, especially in the Central Region and in the North, and in some places it is also rainy in summer. Remember to travel with adequate clothes.\\n* In summer, avoid direct exposure to sunlight for long periods of time to prevent [[Sunburn and sun protection|sunburn and heatstroke]]. Drink water, walk on the shady side of street and keep a container of sun cream (suntan lotion) handy.\\n\\n===Water===\\nThe '''[[tap water]]''' in Spain is safe and of a drinkable quality. The water in some southern regions of the country, however, is sometimes sourced from salt water which can have a high mineral content. This can cause upset stomachs in those not used to this. While high mineral content water is safe to drink regardless, locals in these areas will often drink bottled water instead as it tastes better. Bottled water is readily available to buy in most areas and in a variety of brands.\\n\\n===Smoking===\\nSmoking is banned in all enclosed public spaces and places of work, in public transportation, and in outdoor public places near hospitals and in playgrounds. Smoking is also banned in outdoor sections of bars and restaurants. Smoking is banned in television broadcasts as well.\\n\\n==Respect==\\nGenerally speaking, Spaniards are widely regarded as welcoming and friendly.\\n\\n====Culture and identity====\\n\\nSpaniards are generally '''neutral communicators'''. They're comfortable with expressing their opinions and emotions on something, and they expect the same from you. While this may give you the impression that Spanish people are confident and sociable, you should make every effort to be tactful with your words as they are sensitive to being beckoned directly.\\n\\nIn conversational settings, it is common for people to interrupt or talk over one another. Shouting to make oneself heard is common, as is the use of swear words. You may also find that it is common for people to give you advice on all kinds of things. For instance, you can expect people to tell you what to see and where to go. At first, this may come across as annoying, but the information that Spaniards provide is meant to help you in a good way, not lay traps for you.\\n\\nFamily values are important to many Spaniards. Passing unwarranted comments and/or criticisms about someone's family members is considered rude.\\n\\nSpaniards, especially the young, generally feel a linguistic and cultural connection to Latin America. However, most will be quick to point out that Spain is a European nation, not a Latin American one and that all Spanish-speaking countries are different and have particularities of their own.\\n\\nSpaniards are not as religious as the media sometimes presents them, and modern Spanish society is for the most part rather secular, but they are and always were a mostly Catholic country (73% officially, although only 10% admit practising and only 20% admit being believers); respect this and avoid making any comments that could offend. In particular, religious festivals, Holy Week (Easter), and Christmas are very important to Spaniards. Tolerance of all religions should be observed, especially in large urban areas like Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville or Malaga (where people and temples of all beliefs can be found) or different regions in southern Spain, which may have a sizable Muslim population (which accounts for almost 4% of the country's population).\\n\\n[[File:Ayuntamiento de Madrid - Rainbow flag - 170627 204010.jpg|thumb|The rainbow flag on Madrid's city hall]]\\nDespite being a Catholic majority country, '''homosexuality''' is quite tolerated in Spain and public display of same-sex affection would not likely stir hostility. A 2013 Pew survey of various countries in the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East found that Spain had the highest percentage of people who believed homosexuality should be accepted by society, at 88%. Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2005 and the government provides legal benefits to same-sex couples. However, this does not always necessarily mean that all Spaniards are friendly to gays; while homophobic aggressions are rare, they still happen. Cities are more tolerant of homosexuality than rural areas, Madrid, Catalonia and the Basque Country are much more tolerant but overall Spain is gay-friendly. As in any other place, elderly people do usually have far more conservative points of view. The Madrid pride parade is one of the largest in the world. Overall, Spain is one of the safest countries for LGBT tourists.\\n\\nAvoid talking about the former colonial past and especially about the \\\"Black Legend.\\\" Regardless of what you may have heard Spain had several ministers and military leaders of mixed race serving in the military during the colonial era and even a Prime Minister born in the Philippines (Marcelo Azcarraga Palmero). Many Spaniards take pride in their history and former imperial glories. People from Spain's former colonies (Latin America, Equatorial Guinea, the Philippines, Western Sahara and Northern Morocco) make up a majority of foreign immigrants in Spain (58%) along with the Chinese, Africans and Eastern Europeans. Equally, Spain is one of the main investors and economic and humanitarian aid donors to Latin America and Africa.\\n\\n'''Bullfighting''' (Spanish: ''Tauromaquia'') is seen by many Spaniards as a cultural heritage icon, but the disaffection with bullfighting is increasing in all big cities and obviously among animal activist groups within the country. Many urban Spaniards would consider bullfighting a show aimed at foreign tourists and elderly people from the countryside, and some young Spaniards will feel offended if their country is associated with it. To illustrate how divided the country is, many Spaniards point to the royal family: former king Juan Carlos and his daughter are avid fans, while his wife and son King Felipe VI do not care for the sport. Bullfights and related events, such as the annual San Fermin Pamplona bull-runs, make up a multi-million euro industry and draw many tourists, both foreign and Spanish. In addition, bullfighting has been banned in the northeastern region of Catalonia as well as in several towns and counties all over the country.\\n\\nTake care when mentioning the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 to 1975 as well as the Civil War of 1936\\u20131939. This was a painful past as Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist, executing many Spaniards who violated the anti-democratic laws of the regime. It was also a notable period of economic growth in the final years of Franco's regime, and some older Spaniards may have supportive views of him. The Republican flag (red, yellow, purple, either with or without a coat of arms) can be seen hanging from balconies and bought at some souvenir shops. However, it is not an uncontroversial symbol and associated with leftism, often showing up at leftist demonstrations. No symbols from the Franco era are officially forbidden, but using or displaying them is associated with far right extremists.\\n\\nThe possibilities of '''[[Catalonia|Catalan]]''' independence, '''[[Basque Country|Basque]]''' independence, and '''[[Galicia]]n''' independence are extremely sensitive issues among many in Spain. You should avoid discussing them where possible. If anything surrounding these subjects is brought up by someone, it's best to stay neutral.\\n\\nVirtually everyone in Spain, regardless of region, is able to speak '''Castilian Spanish''', albeit not always as a mother tongue. In Catalonia, some Catalans prefer to not speak Spanish at all, and will reply to Spanish-speaking interlocutors in Catalan; this is usually a political statement, rather than a lack of Castilian language ability. Foreigners are given a bit more leeway, but there are still some Catalans who'd rather have a conversation in English than Spanish if those are the only options for communication. While many Spaniards from Castilla consider Catalan to be a dialect of Spanish, Catalans consider it to be a separate language in its own right.\\n\\nThe political status of Gibraltar is a particularly sensitive issue. Most Spaniards consider Gibraltar to be Spanish sovereign territory that is illegally occupied by Britain. Most Gibraltarians on the other hand are both proud Brits and proud Europeans - a situation made infinitely more awkward by Brexit which passed against near unanimous Gibraltarian opposition.\\n\\nAvoid discussing the Spanish monarchy. Many are generally opposed to the Spanish royal family, although there are some who are staunchly monarchist. Due to the Bourbon dynasty's identification with centralism, supporters of Catalan and Basque independence often don't have a good word to say about them.\\n\\n====Socialising====\\n\\nIt is customary to kiss friends, family, and acquaintances on both cheeks upon seeing each other and saying goodbye. Male-to-male kisses of this sort are limited to family members or to very close friends; otherwise a firm handshake is expected instead (as is the same in France or Italy).\\n\\nSpaniards are keen to maintain physical contact while talking, such as putting a hand on your shoulder, patting your back, etc. These should be taken as signs of friendship done among relatives, close friends and colleagues.\\n\\nSpaniards will probably feel comfortable around you more quickly than other Europeans and you may even be receive an offensive comment or even an insult (''cabr\\u00f3n'') for a greeting shortly after meeting someone in an informal environment, especially if it is a young person or a male. You should not feel offended by this, as it is interpreted as proof that you have such a close relationship that you can mess with each other without repercussions.\\n\\nYou should reply with a similar comment (never anything serious or something that will genuinely hurt the person) or just greet them. Do not go around insulting people, though, as you will also find people who do not like it. It is recommended that you never do this first as a foreigner and just wait until you get it. Generally, your instinct will be able to distinguish between a joke and a genuine aggression.\\n\\nWhen in a car, the elderly and pregnant always ride in the passenger's seat, unless they request not to.\\n\\nSpaniards are not as punctual as Northern Europeans, but generally you are expected to arrive no more than ten minutes late, and being punctual will always be received positively. It is especially important to be punctual the first time you meet with someone. As a rule of thumb, you should expect people to be more punctual as you go north and less punctual as you go south.\\n\\nIf you are staying at a Spaniard's home, bring shoes to wear inside such as slippers. Walking around barefoot in the house is viewed as unsanitary. Walking in socks may be acceptable in a close friend's house, but you should always ask first.\\n\\nIt is acceptable for women to '''sunbathe topless''' in beaches, but full nudity is only practised in \\\"clothing-optional\\\" or nudist beaches.\\n\\n====Eating and drinking====\\n\\nDuring lunch or dinner, Spaniards do not begin eating until everyone is seated and ready to eat. Likewise, they do not leave the table until everyone is finished eating. Table manners are otherwise standard and informal, although this also depends on the place you are eating. When the bill comes, it is common to pay equally, regardless of the amount or price each has consumed (''pagar a escote'').\\n\\nWhen Spaniards receive a gift or are offered a drink or a meal, they usually refuse for a while, so as not to seem greedy. This sometimes sparks arguments among especially reluctant people, but it is seen as polite. Remember to offer more than once (on the third try, it must be fairly clear if they will accept it or not). On the other hand, if you are interested in the offer, politely smile and decline it, saying that you don't want to be a nuisance, etc., but relent and accept when they insist.\\n\\nSpaniards rarely drink or eat in the street. Bars will rarely offer the option of food to take away but \\\"tapas\\\" are easily available. Taking leftovers home from a restaurant is uncommon but has somewhat less of a stigma than it used to. One asks for \\\"un taper\\\" (derived from \\\"Tupperware\\\") or \\\"una caja.\\\" Older Spaniards are still likely to frown on this. Appearing drunk in public is generally frowned upon.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\nOne odd legacy of the Franco era is that Spain has been on Central European Time since 1940, even though much of the country sits directly south of the United Kingdom and Ireland. This explains why among Spaniards, lunch time is usually between 13:00 and 14:30 (it could be as late as 15:15) while dinner time is between 20:30 and 21:30. At special celebrations, dinner can be as late as 22:00. Lunch is considered the biggest and most important meal of the day.\\n\\nIf you see a restaurant serving breakfast at 7:00, lunch at 12:00 and dinner at 18:00, it may be a tourist trap targeting British and American tourists. The same can be said for restaurants serving paella for dinner, since the dish is traditionally served for lunch.\\n\\nAlmost all small businesses close between 14:30 and 17:00, so plan your shopping and sight-seeing accordingly. Shopping malls and supermarkets, however, are usually open from 09:30 to 21:00 or 22:00, and in the larger cities several shops are open 24 hours daily, usually owned by Chinese immigrants.\\n\\nSpanish cities can be noisy in some areas; you might want to check before booking a room.\\n\\n==Connect==\\n=== Wi-Fi ===\\n\\nWi-Fi points in bars and cafeterias are available to customers, and most hotels offer Wi-Fi connections (at least in common areas) for their guests.\\n\\nBe conscious of security when using a laptop, tablet or phone in an outdoor location.\\n\\n=== Phone numbers ===\\nSince 1998, the area code prefix is included in Spanish telephone numbers, so {{nowrap|9xx xxx xxx}} can be called as {{nowrap|+34 9xx xxx xxx}}. Numbers without an area code can be called similarly, with the domestic number just prefixed with +34. The prefix for international calls from Spain changed to 00 (with mobile phones, just use \\\"+\\\"). Some premium rate and freephone numbers are unreachable from abroad.\\n\\nThe dispute on Gibraltar numbers ended in 2007; now Gibraltar can be reached with the prefix +350 like from everywhere else.\\n\\nThe prefixes 80x and 90x, where x\\u22600, are for possibly expensive (premium rate) numbers. The prefix 807 is for professional services (such as legal or medical advice) paid on the phone bill. The prefixes 901 and 902 are used by many large businesses, but they are often expensive, especially 902, as they aren't covered by the flat rates most operators apply. They are blocked by some operators. 800 and 900 are prefixes for freephone numbers. 90x and 80x can not be reached from outside Spain.\\n\\n=== Mobile phones and SIM cards ===\\nCheap mobile phones (less than \\u20ac50) with some pre-paid minutes are sold at  any phone operator's shop and can be purchased without many formalities (ID is usually required). Topping-up is then done by buying scratch cards from the small stores \\\"Frutos Secos,\\\" supermarkets, vending points (often found in tobacco shops) or kiosks \\u2013 recharging using the Web or an ATM does not work with foreign credit cards.\\n\\n{{EU roaming}}\\n\\nFor supported unlocked phones, a [[Mobile phones#Local SIM cards|local SIM]] or an [[Mobile phones#eSIM|eSIM]] is another alternative.\\n\\nThe three mobile phone networks in Spain are [http://www.vodafone.es/autonomos/es Vodafone], [https://www.movistar.es Movistar],  [https://www.orange.es Orange], and Yoigo.\\n\\n=== Discount calling ===\\n\\n\\\"Locutorios\\\" (call shops) are widely spread in bigger cities and touristy locations. In Madrid or Toledo it's very easy to find one. Making calls from \\\"Locutorios\\\" tend to be much cheaper, especially international calls (usually made through VoIP). They are usually a good pick for calling home.  Prepaid calling cards for cheap international calls are widely available in newsagents or grocery stores around the city. Ask for a \\\"tarjeta telefonica\\\".\\n\\n{{geo|40.4|-3|zoom=6}}\\n{{isPartOf|Iberia}}\\n{{related|Cycling_in_Spain}}\\n{{usablecountry}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Ciutat_Vella_Barcelona_banner.jpg|pgname=Ciutat Vella}}\\n\\n'''[http://w110.bcn.cat/portal/site/CiutatVella Ciutat Vella]''' (Catalan for ''Old city'') is, as its name suggests, the oldest part of [[Barcelona]]. Centred along the Las Ramblas boulevard, it includes Barcelona's old port as well as parts built from the early Middle Ages to mid-19th century. Ciutat Vella is where the nightlife, as well as the tourist traffic in Barcelona is centred.\\n\\nIf you are looking for the famous Gaudi creations, they are not here - except for Palau G\\u00fcell - head over to [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]] and [[Barcelona/Gracia|Gracia]] to see them.\\n\\n[[File:La Rambla Barcelona 2004.JPG|thumb|right|View of Las Ramblas, Barcelona]]\\n==Understand==\\n\\nThe district is divided in four quarters:\\n\\n* '''Barceloneta''' or ''Little Barcelona'' was built after King Felipe V ordered the construction of a new fortress (La Ciutadella, nowadays a park) in order to control and punish the city of Barcelona, that fought against him during the war of Spanish Succession. The fortress was planned very close to the city so that a tenth of it was demolished, and the people who lived in this part had no compensation and as a bigger punishment were obliged to demolish their own houses.  The people from the demolished part of Barcelona had to move, so a new quarter was planned by the French military. Therefore, the streets are straight and with a square shape. There are still some houses from this period, easy to recognize because they are much lower than the others and have a simple neoclassical decoration.  Historically a fisherman's quarter, Barceloneta was traditionally a poor quarter, with dark and narrow streets, but since the 1992 Olympics significant gentrification has taken place. Most noticeably along the seafront. There are now delis serving upscale foodstuffs and high rise office buildings going up.\\n* '''Barri G\\u00f2tic''' is the oldest part of the old town.  It literally has its foundations in Roman times as it was built upon the old settlement of Barcino.  It's quite easy to see these portions of the Roman wall through this area and for those looking to see more, you can visit the City History museum which takes you below ground to tour the 2,000 year-old foundations.  Fully pedestrian, this area is quite popular for visitors to see the history of the city.  While not as active in boutique shops as La Ribera next door, it boasts its fair share of night life and shops.  Most people walk through here to view the quite stunning architecture with the ancient building leaning this way and that on their centuries-old foundations.  It is also the location of the Barcelona Cathedral which is a focal point of the city.\\n* '''La Ribera''' is a large section of the old town that encompasses everything between Arc de Triomf and Via Laietana.  It is often mistakenly called the El Born after the large, 19th-century market that sits in the area below Carrer de la Princesa.  In reality, Born is a sub neighborhood of La Ribera much like the area around the upper, Santa Catarina market.  Regardless of whether you go to the upper or lower sections, it is a very happening neighborhood with lots to do and see.  By day, there are many small shops and local designers.  By night, there is a thriving bar and restaurant scene.  It's easily reachable on foot and contains no end of old buildings, many of which date back to the 15th century.  It's easy to see the thriving, commercial past of the neighborhood with colourful names such as (in English): \\\"the street of jars\\\", \\\"the street of the silver smiths\\\", and so on.\\n* '''El Raval''' is the neighborhood of the old town just to the west of Las Ramblas.  Historically, it's had an incredibly seedy reputation, being a den of prostitution, drugs, and general crime.  This changed on a tremendous scale right before the 1992 Olympics when the city government demolished tremendous amounts of old buildings to construct new ones as well as to open up the neighborhood to more natural light given that historically, it was known to be quite dark.  This move was quite controversial as it displaced thousands of people, but for better or worse, it did change the neighborhood.  These days, it's a vibrant place for nightlife and while still very much an immigrant neighborhood, it's home to no end of bars and restaurants.  While not as historically significant as say, Barri G\\u00f2tic or La Ribera, but gradually more civic structures are sprouting in the area, such as the Filmoteca.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{Mapframe|41.379|2.181|zoom=14}}\\n{{Mapshape}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q237189}} <!-- metro -->\\n\\nSince Ciutat Vella is also the city centre, nearly all public transportation leads you there.

During the day, La Rambla is packed with tourists, at night, the locals come out, as well as many prostitutes. There, you can find newspaper and book stands, birds, flowers, musicians, street-performing artists that all contribute to create a lively and unique atmosphere. If you happen to be here after Barca win, you are in for a treat. A few blocks south of its north end, you will find La Boqueria, a very large, covered open air market.\\n}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=Maritime Museum | alt=Museu Maritime MMB | url=http://www.mmb.cat/ | email=\\n| address=Av. de les Drassanes, 1 | lat=41.375028 | long=2.176369 | directions=from the Columbus sculpture to the right\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=10:00-19:00 | price=Free on the first Sa each month from 15:00\\n| wikipedia=Maritime Museum of Barcelona | image=Drassanes barcelona.jpg | wikidata=Q1286354\\n| content=Housed in Drassanes, the Gothic shipyard of the city.

It was built at the final part of the 19th century in the place that formerly occupied the fortress (''ciutadella'') built after the defeat of 1714. This fortress was hated by the citizens, and when the middle age walls were demolished, so was most of the fortress. Some buildings where conserved, as such as the church, and the gunpowder magazine. The new park was used as the place to hold the 1888 international expo, and some of the older modernist buildings are there, such as the Zoology Museum, the greenhouse and, following the avenue ''Passeig de Sant Joan'' (towards the mountain), the ''Arc del Triomf'', a modernist ''Arc de Triomphe''.\\n}}\\n\\n[[File:PortVell.JPG|thumb|250px|''Rambla de Mar'' bridge in Port Vell (Old Port)]]\\n* {{see\\n| name=Port Vell | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=41.37675 | long=2.184639 | directions=walk down La Rambla until the monument to Columbus, the sea is just after it\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Port Vell | image=Port-Vell-Night.JPG | wikidata=Q1114612\\n| content=The harbor was closed to the public until the 80s and received a complete makeover before the Olympics in 1992.

A major port on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain, Barcelona has a wide variety of attractions that bring in tourists from around the globe. The many faces of Barcelona include the medieval Old Town, and the unique street grid resulting from 19th-century urban planning. The city has long sandy beaches and green parks on the hills, pretty much side-by-side. It is also famous for a number of prominent buildings, of which the most-known are by the architect Antoni Gaud\\u00ed, including his ''Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia'', which became Barcelona's symbol to many.\\n\\nFounded more than 2,000 years ago as the [[Roman empire|ancient Roman]] town ''Barcino'', Barcelona is as historic as it is modern, with a constant flow of projects changing the face of the city and long-standing penchant for design and innovation. Thanks to the wealth of attractions, a very well-developed accommodation base, a lively nightlife and a robust transportation system, Barcelona has become one of Europe's, and pretty much the world's, most popular tourist destinations.\\n\\n==Districts==\\n\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500|show=mask,go}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q941385|fill=#bdbd7b|title=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q64124|fill=#8888dc|title=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q852697|fill=#75bb75|title=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q753075|fill=#aa6baa|title=[[Barcelona/Sants-Montju\\u00efc|Sants-Montju\\u00efc]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q250935|fill=#67b7b7|title=[[Barcelona/Sant Mart\\u00ed|Sant Mart\\u00ed]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q959944, Q1765582, Q1771488, Q1641049, Q1650230 |fill=#c9815e|title=[[Barcelona/Inland Suburbs|Inland Suburbs]]}} <!-- Les Corts, Sarri\\u00e0-Sant Gervasi, Horta-Guinard\\u00f3, Nou Barris, Sant Andreu -->\\n\\n{{Mapshapes|Q237189|stroke-opacity=0.6}} <!-- metro -->\\n\\n{{Regionlist\\n| region1name=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]\\n| region1color=#bdbd7b\\n| region1description=Barcelona's old town, including the medieval Barri G\\u00f2tic, La Rambla (Les Rambles), Raval, and El Born (also known as La Ribera)\\n\\n| region2name=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]\\n| region2color=#8888dc\\n| region2description=Modernist quarter, central hub of the city, and ''the'' area to go to find Antoni Gaud\\u00ed's work.\\n\\n| region3name=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]\\n| region3color=#75bb75\\n| region3description=Formerly an independent town, it joined the city in the 20th century.

However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\\n\\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to [[Costa Daurada]], north to [[Costa Brava]] or out to sea for the [[Balearic Islands]].\\n\\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low. Given the high humidity, {{convert|19|-|23|\\u00b0C|0}} is considered comfortable weather, which is usually the temperature from May to June, and from late August to October. These are the best times to visit the city.  Anything warmer than this can feel too hot, and the period from November to April is quite chilly and at times gloomy.\\n\\n===With children===\\nToddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain. In any public place, people around you will make every effort possible to make your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them.

Fa\\u00e7ana de la Passi\\u00f3.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia church by Antoni Gaud\\u00ed is perhaps the most known landmark of Barcelona]]\\n\\nBarcelona's official languages are [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] and [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]. About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese. On the other hand, FGC announcements \\u2013 either regular or disruptions \\u2013 will be made only in Catalan, and disruption announcements on RENFE's network will usually be made only in Spanish. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a separate Romance language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.\\n\\nYou might find some locals answer in Catalan after being asked in Spanish, that's not because they are being rude but because they assume you are bilingual. In Catalonia, it's not uncommon to hear people code switching between different languages in the same conversation. In case you can't understand what they are saying, tell them you don't speak Catalan and politely ask them to repeat it in Spanish or English.\\n\\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia is a large scale immigration process from the rest of Spain, which occurred over the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language, and 40% use Catalan. The issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere.\\n\\nIn tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak English. If you are a native English speaker, you will have few problems, as Barcelona hosts many tourists.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\n[[File:Aeropuerto de Barcelona (1322744358).jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona International Airport]]\\nThe main airport is {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona El Prat|wikidata=Q56973}} ({{IATA|BCN}}). Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use the airports of ''[[Girona]]'' ({{IATA|GRO}}), nearly {{km|100}} to the north, or ''[[Reus]]'' ({{IATA|REU}}), around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair started operating at BCN, you should check carefully where your flight goes. The three-letter IATA code should be part of your booking process.\\n\\n====Barcelona International Airport====\\n{{main|Barcelona El Prat Airport}}\\n\\n[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Barcelona/en/Barcelona-El-Prat.html Barcelona International Airport] ({{IATA|BCN}}), also known as '''El Prat''', is a major transport hub, with flights from all over Europe and beyond, is by far the closest airport to the city. To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for \\u20ac5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs \\u20ac12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport) , tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (\\u20ac7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya on its way to Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya. See the Public Transport section in Get Around below for more information on tickets & passes as there were major changes in 2023.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Girona-Costa-Brava/en/Home.html Girona\\u2013Costa Brava Airport]====\\nThe Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estaci\\u00f3 del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport, synchronised with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs \\u20ac16 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac25. The journey takes approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Timetables are available [http://www.sagales.com/index.php?nIdioma=LANG3 online]. You can also take a train (you can choose between local ''Rodalies'', ''Media Distancia'' and high speed  AVE trains with different travel times and price points) to Girona main train station and a local bus from there to the airport.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Reus/en/ Reus Airport]====\\nThe easiest way is to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs \\u20ac13 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac24. The journey takes from 1 hr 30 min to 1 hr 45 min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available [http://www.igualadina.com/pdfs/REUS%20AIRPORT.pdf? online]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs \\u20ac7.25 and then the bus costs \\u20ac2.5. This takes about 2\\u00bd hours. Train timetables can be checked at Renfe's [http://www.renfe.com website] and the bus timetable is available at the [http://www.reustransport.cat/pdf/L50.pdf website]{{Dead link|date=November 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} of Reus public transport.\\n\\n[[File:Estacio Barcelona Sants - 1 - 2010-10-18 - JTCurses.jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona Sants railway station]]\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:RENFE AVE S-103 15.jpg|thumbnail|right|Superfast trains will whiz you to Barcelona from across Spain and France]]\\n\\nBarcelona is well-connected to the Spanish railway network, and to the rest of Europe. High-speed trains run frequently from main station {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona Sants|wikidata=Q800453|lat=41.37911238|long=2.139878268|url=https://www.adif.es/w/71801-barcelona-sants}} (in the southwest of the city) to Madrid, Seville and Malaga. There are also regular long-distance connections that partially use high-speed infrastructure to all major Spanish cities. The station is also served by many regional lines including {{rint|catalonia|rdc}}{{rint|catalonia|r1}}{{rint|catalonia|r2}}{{rint|catalonia|r2s}}{{rint|catalonia|r2n}}{{rint|catalonia|r3}}{{rint|catalonia|r4}}{{rint|catalonia|r11}}\\n\\nThe historic {{marker|type=go|name=Estaci\\u00f3 de Fran\\u00e7a|wikidata=Q800449}} now mostly serves regional trains.\\n\\nDirect regular [https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-europe/tgv-inoui-espagne/ high-speed train service] goes to destinations in France. In addition to two daily TGV services from [[Paris]] (travel time ~7 hr to Barcelona), there is a daily service from [[Lyon]] (5 hr), and a daily service from [[Marseille]] (4 hr). Prices start at \\u20ac39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\\n\\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerb\\u00e8re/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\\n\\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7\\u20138 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly \\u20ac30.\\n\\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called ''[http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/larga_distancia/productos/trenhotel.html Trenhotel]'' between Barcelona and Paris. ''Trenhotels'' still do, however, run between Barcelona and [[Granada]], [[A Coru\\u00f1a]] and [[Vigo]].\\n\\nThe security checks are taken seriously and may take some time.

There are two operators: RENFE and FGC. Wrongly ignored by some tourists, they provide a useful additional mode of transport for getting across the city or connecting with mainline rail services and the airport.\\n\\nThe trains run by RENFE share tracks with mainline trains and are called Rodalies {{rint|catalonia|rdc}} (known in the rest of Spain as Cercan\\u00edas).

Perhaps the best option in planning your route is to consult with one of the route planners mentioned above.\\n\\nA major reorganisation of bus lines was completed in November 2018, so disregard old bus schedules and recheck routes. For example, bus line 92 to Park G\\u00fcell, used by many tourists to get there after a visit to the Sagrada Familia, has been suspended, and a new line V15 stops there but takes a different route through the city centre (Passeig de Sant Joan).\\n\\nHere are some tips for bus line codes:\\n\\n* Hxx lines run parallel to the coastline, low numbers run on the high side, high numbers on the sea side.\\n* Vxx lines run from the beach to the hills, high numbers on the northern side (Bes\\u00f2s), low numbers on the southern (Llobregat).\\n* Dxx lines run in a somewhat diagonal path, although interestingly none of these cover neither Diagonal or Meridiana avenues, the main oblique streets.\\n* Mxx lines are found at the outer perimeter of metro coverage and link a metro stop to a neighbourhood lacking metro service.\\n* Bxx lines run on the northern area outside Barcelona or linking Barcelona to neighbouring municipalities in the metropolitan area, B stands for Bes\\u00f2s river.\\n* Lxx lines run on the southern area alike Bxx lines, L stands for Llobregat river.\\n* Some municipalities have lines fully inside the town limits with two letters and a digit, theses two letters are reminiscent of the town name, such as BDx for Badalona and LHx for L'Hospitalet\\n* Nxx lines run only at night when all other lines do not run, roughly from 23:00 to 6:00.\\n* Cxx lines link Barcelona the various northern coastal Maresme towns up to [[Matar\\u00f3]].\\n* Exx lines are express buses from Barcelona to various municipalities {{km|10-60}} outside of the metropolitan area.\\n* Lines with one or two digits without any letter follow historical routes from before the H-V-D schema.\\n* Lines between 100 and 199 are usually very local lines served with low-capacity cars and poor frequency, 30 min or worse. Notable cases are line 111 to the Tibidabo amusement park, line 120 through Ciutat Vella, and line 150 to Olympic venues and the Montju\\u00efc castle; others are mostly useless for tourists.\\n* Line numbers from 200 upwards are used for some routes going outside the metropolitan area, while some others of the same kind have no number at all.\\n\\nBuses H-V-D run about every 6\\u201312 min weekdays, 15\\u201320 min weekends. \\n\\nNitbus (N) run every 20 min all night.

It takes little over an hour to walk from Port Vell at the seaside to Park G\\u00fcell at the foothills of the mountain range at the northeastern end of the city, and you can see a range of attractions, including La Rambla and Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia, on your way. There are opportunities all around to sit down and enjoy a drink or a meal everywhere. If you are fit, you can pretty much explore the city by foot alone, unless the heat beats you in the warmer months (and then you can always resort to the air-conditioned metro).\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (\\u20ac3/hour, \\u20ac20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\\n\\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, ''Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes'' is actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\\n\\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\\n* Near ''Moll de Sant Bertran'' (which is south-west from ''Museu Maritim'') - driving at B\\u201310, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\\n* Somewhere near Guell Park.\\n* Near Font M\\u00e0gica, in Pla\\u00e7a Espanya and the Montju\\u00efc hill.\\n\\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.\\n\\n=== By taxi ===\\nAs of January 2019, [[Ride-sharing and carsharing services|ride-sharing services]] such as Uber require at least one hour's notice. For less than one hour's notice, you need to call a regular taxi.\\n\\n==See==\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500}}\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n{{infobox|What to see in the dark|The most spectacular sights in the night are:\\n* ''Musical fountains'', in Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.

Moreover on the Port Vell, right at the end of The Ramblas there is Maremagnum, a shopping mall that stays open all Sundays.\\n\\nIf you see people selling items on the street on a blanket, do not buy from them.

Bon\\u00c0rea, Bonpreu and Condis are the most popular supermarket chains from Catalonia. Mercadona, Consum, and Dia are other popular chains from the rest of Spain. All of them are a cost-effective way to purchase grocery items. There are also organic/specialty supermarkets like Casa Ametller or Veritas which are pricier. Small corner stores are the most visible on city streets, but tend to mark up prices in exchange for convenience.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nAs with all cities which welcome large numbers of tourists, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, but there are plenty of restaurants serving excellent food at very reasonable prices, if you know where to look. The usual rules of thumb apply: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track used by fellow travellers, and seek out caf\\u00e9s and restaurants which the locals frequent. In practice, this usually involves searching out eateries in residential districts away from the main sightseeing attractions. Avoid restaurants with touts outside, and have a basic understanding of the traditional foods served in restaurants, as well as the local drinks. One slightly crafty way of sussing a place's authenticity at a glance is to take note of how they spell a certain word: a menu board advertising ''tap'''a'''s'', written the Spanish/international way, is likely to be somewhere which primarily caters to tourists, whereas somewhere offering ''tap'''e'''s'', using Catalan spelling, is in all probability a venue frequented by locals.\\n\\nSome districts to check out include [[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]], which is a hub of quality, affordable Catalan cooking of both the traditional and more avant-garde varieties, and the [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]], whose chic boulevards have upscale restaurants aplenty worthy of your splurge money. The fishing quarter of Barceloneta (in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]) is an example of a neighbourhood where it pays to be picky: closer to the gentrified seafront, a slew of mojito beach bar-style places serve up expensive tourist tapas; for the real thing, head into the backstreets, where many traditional bars are still tucked away. In all cases, be prepared to \\\"promenade\\\" in search of the most attractive-looking menu; that's what the locals do, after all.\\n\\n{{infobox|Where to eat during siesta|The majority of restaurants and cafes are closed 16:00-20:00 for ''migdiada''. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:\\n* tapas in bars\\n* international chains\\n* food stands in market halls}}\\n\\n'''Set menus (men\\u00fa del migdia / men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda)''' Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a ''men\\u00fa del migdia'' / ''men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' (menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for \\u20ac12 to \\u20ac20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 14:00 to 16:00. The savvy traveller will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve ''platos combinados'', which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.\\n\\n'''Smoking''' is not permitted inside bars and restaurants since 2011, but it's usually allowed in terraces.\\n\\n===Dishes===\\n[[File:Tapas Barcelona.jpg|thumb|250px|A plate of ''tapes'']]\\n\\nYou can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.\\n\\n''See [[Catalonia#Catalan Cuisine|Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article]].''\\n\\nThe selection of '''seafood''' is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).\\n\\nA treat to try that no travel guide mentions is '''waffles''' sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\\n\\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\\n\\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of '''durum''' or '''shawarma''' stands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around \\u20ac5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the '''Asian''' selection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants, while '''Latin American''' offerings, particularly Argentine and [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], are well-represented too.\\n\\n===Food tours===\\n\\nIf you feel lost in the variety of food choices there are \\u2013 Catalan, Basque, Spanish, and beyond \\u2013 it may be helpful to do a food tour to quickly get oriented.

Barceloneta is a very good place to eat ''tapas'' as well.\\n* Sant Antoni is the new addition to the culinary scene in Barcelona where old and trendy cuisine mingle.\\n* Eixample Esquerra (between Gran Via and Mallorca)\\n* Barri G\\u00f2tic (especially for tapas)\\n* \\\"El Born\\\" (next to Barri G\\u00f2tic)\\n\\nAround Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya there are dozens of restaurants serving ''tapas''. One should be careful with the tourist traps as the area is highly populated with tourists.\\n\\nFor budget eating you may choose \\\"men\\u00fa del migdia\\\" in small bars on the Avinguda del Parallel for \\u20ac9-11 per person. Be aware that sometimes the menu and the staff are only in Spanish.\\n\\nThe large cafes that line the Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia and the Rambla Catalunya, just north of the Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, offer a variety of acceptable tapas.

Wi-Fi is widely available in public places and on transport.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Pickpockets===\\n\\n[[Pickpockets|Pickpocketing]] is the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona. '''Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents''' in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\\n\\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\\n* At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\\n* A milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\\n* East Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \\\"martial arts\\\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\\n* These people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\\n* Male travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\\n* In the '''subway''', a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance ''and'' exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\\n* Under no circumstances should you '''leave your items''' unattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\\n\\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can [https://denuncies.dgp.interior.gencat.cat/denuncies/ file a report online] if you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices.\\n\\n===Scams===\\n{{Seealso|Common scams}}\\n\\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\\n\\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of [[common scams#Overcharging|methods]] are employed, including the [[common scams#No-change_trick|No-change trick]]. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.\\n\\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\\n\\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\\n\\nA version of [[common scams#Three Card Monte|Three Card Monte]] is one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\\n\\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you.\\n\\n===Violent crimes===\\n\\nIn 2019 there was a surge in violent crimes around Barcelona: in just the summer, there were almost as many violent deaths as there were for the whole previous year. While tourists are only occasionally targeted (and almost exclusively simple robberies), this should be not a going concern, many of these deaths are either drug-related or take place during drunken fights, so you are best advised to avoid such situations.\\n\\n===Football===\\nLocal club '''FC Barcelona''' (also known as \\\"Bar\\u00e7a\\\", a term used by locals to refer strictly to the club and not the city) is seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and has a very heated and politically-charged rivalry with Real Madrid, which is seen as a symbol of the Spanish state and ruling establishment, and violent confrontations between the supporters of both clubs have been known to occur. Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\\n\\nFurthermore, the local ''Derbi barcelon\\u00ed'' between FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain. If you hear Bar\\u00e7a and Espanyol fans having an argument, be careful, as things can quickly escalate.\\n\\n===ATMs===\\nBarcelona offers ATMs in many locations. Many provide a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.), and most accept ATM/debit/credit cards of various banks. Choose an ATM in a secure or highly-public space (e.g., in a bank lobby or airport terminal) to avoid machines modified by criminals to skim/video your card data or where you might be robbed after use.  Ensure early in usage that the ATM supports a language you understand. For a full discussion of safe/effective charge/debit/ATM card usage and their cost trade-offs, see also [[Money]]. They will charge you a usage fee on top of anything your bank charges you which should be declared on the screen before you proceed (2,90\\u20ac for a 500\\u20ac withdrawal as of Oct. 2024 across different banks).\\n\\n===Areas of caution===\\n\\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (''cercanias'' in Spanish or ''rodalies'' in Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\\n\\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montju\\u00efc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\\n\\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\\n\\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\\n\\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\\n\\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\\n\\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.\\n\\n===Anti-tourism movement===\\n\\nMany Barcelona residents have the impression that there are too many tourists in Barcelona and that it has increased living costs, as landlords prefer to rent to tourists and not to locals to make more profit. Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024.\\n\\n===Cars===\\n\\nTourist drivers may attract special attention, such as [[common scams#Red light bag snatch|Red light bag snatch]] or [[common scams#Flat tire|Flat tire scams]]\\n\\n===Public transportation===\\n\\nBesides being a particular pickpocket hot spot, there are plenty of fare evaders who will stick to you when crossing a fare barrier. Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean ''carte blanche'' for them. The fare evasion fine is just \\u20ac50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome.\\n\\n===Reporting crimes===\\n\\nIf you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers generally do not speak English, even though the theft report form is in English, Spanish, and Catalan. The police station most often used to report theft is the one underneath Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya beside metro station, where they have some translators for common languages.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n===Hospitals===\\nEU citizens can get free or reduced cost medical treatment on presentation of an EHIC card and passport.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Hospital Clinic I Provincial De Barcelona | url= | email=\\n| address=C/ Villarroel 170 | lat= | long= | directions=Metro Stn Hospital Clinic (Line 5)\\n| phone=+34 932 275 400 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===Consulates===\\n\\n{|\\n|-\\n| style=\\\"vertical-align:top;width:50%;\\\" |\\n* {{flag|Angola}} {{listing\\n| name=Angola | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer del Consell de Cent, 413-415 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 245 02 73 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Argentina}} {{listing\\n| name=Argentina | url=http://cbarc.mrecic.gov.ar/en | email=\\n| address=Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia, 11 (08007) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 304 12 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Australia}} {{listing\\n| name=Australia | url=http://spain.embassy.gov.au/madr/home.html | email=ausconbcn@gmail.com\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 433 Bis, Second Floor, Door 1 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 362 3792 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Austria}} {{listing\\n| name=Austria | url= | email=barcelona@consuladodeaustria.com\\n| address=Carrer de Mari\\u00e0 Cub\\u00ed, 7 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 368 60 03 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bangladesh}} {{listing\\n| name=Bangladesh | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Londres, 35 (08029) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 410 83 89 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belgium}} {{listing\\n| name=Belgium |alt=| url=http://www.diplomatie.be/barcelonafr/default.asp?id=31&mnu=31 | email=barcelona@diplobel.fed.be\\n| address=Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 680 (08010) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 80 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n|wikidata=|lastedit=2020-08-05| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belize}} {{listing\\n| name=Belize | url= | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 469 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 430 30 44 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Benin}} {{listing\\n| name=Benin | url=http://www.consuladobenin.com/ | email=consuladobenein@terra.es\\n| address=Carrer d'Arag\\u00f3, 290 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bolivia}} {{listing\\n| name=Bolivia | url=http://consuladodeboliviaenbarcelona.es/ | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Roger de Flor, 3 (08018) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 322 65 12 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Brazil}} {{listing\\n| name=Brazil | url=http://www.brasilbcn.org/ | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 468 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 488 22 88 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bulgaria}} {{listing\\n| name=Bulgaria | alt= | url=https://www.mfa.bg/es/embassies/spain-barcelona | email=Consulate.Barcelona@mfa.bg\\n| address=Avinguda de la Riera de Cassoles, 54 (08012) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 937 969 950 | tollfree= | fax=+34 937 969 949\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Burkina Faso}} {{listing\\n| name=Burkina Faso | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Muntaner, 261 (08021) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 93 200 99 09 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Canada}} {{listing\\n| name=Canada | url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/spain-espagne/offices-bureaux/consul_barcelona.aspx | email=bclna@internacional.gc.ca\\n| address=Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, 9 (08002) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 412 72 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|France}} {{listing\\n| name=France | url=http://www.consulfrance-barcelone.org/ | email=info@consulfrance-barcelone.org\\n| address=Ronda Universitat 22 bis -

See the historical centre, the churches and cathedral, and visit many architectural works of Llu\\u00eds Dom\\u00e8nech i Montaner. Canet is the smallest town in [[Catalonia]] with many historical and modernist buildings. It also has a lot of ''blue flag'' beaches, recognised at the European level for their quality.\\n*[[Col\\u00f2nia G\\u00fcell]] \\u2014 is a tiny settlement famous for its modernist architecture. It is on the railway to [[Montserrat (Spain)|Montserrat]].\\n*[[Costa Brava]] - The coast North of Barcelona has rocky cliffs and a mix of pebble beaches and sandy beaches.\\n* [[Figueres]]- Home of the most impressive Salvador Dal\\u00ed museum.\\n*[[Girona]] - A quiet town with an ancient Jewish section, narrow streets, imposing walls and plenty of cafes. See directions to the north airport above.\\n* Montseny - UNESCO Biosphere Reserve {{km|40}} northeast of Barcelona. Go there by car or bus/train\\n* [[Montserrat (Spain)|Montserrat]]  - Visit the monastery nestled high in the mountains to see the Black Madonna or hike to the peak to earn a fantastic view of the surroundings. {{km|50}} from Barcelona.\\n* [[Parc del Garraf]] - Large natural area southwest of Barcelona. Many hikes can be reached by train. Be sure to bring sun protection and plenty of water. (An eleven mile hike, with some decent elevation gain: Take train to Castelldefels station, head up to Castel de Castelldefels, follow trail about 5 miles to La Morella, where you can take in some great views. Trace your steps back half a mile, then continue southwest towards Playa Garraf. Playa Grarraf is right by the Garraf train station, allowing easy access back to Barcelona.)\\n*[[Pyrenees]] - A mountain range around {{km|150}} north from the city.\\n*[https://www.visitsantcugat.cat/en/ Sant Cugat del Valles] - Has one of the most interesting Romanesque cloisters in Catalunya, with many interesting carvings. The town itself is full of expensive vilas.\\n* [[Sitges]] - A traditional beachside destination for the locals. Full of fashion shops open on Sundays. Is a popular gay destination too.\\n* [[Castelldefels]] - Another typical beachside destination for the locals. It is very popular for its wide range of gastronomy.\\n*[[Tarragona]] - Old Roman period capital of eastern Spain, and today small seaside city off the tourist trail compared to Barcelona.\\n* Visit the [[Nature parks in Barcelona province]].\\n{{routebox\\n| image3=C-16.svg\\n| imagesize3=50\\n| directionl3=N\\n| majorl3=[[Image:Tabliczka E9.svg|30px]] [[Girona Pyrenees]]\\n| minorl3=[[Terrassa]]\\n| directionr3=S\\n| minorr3=\\n| majorr3=ENDS AT VIA AUGUSTA\\n}}\\n\\n{{related|Ferries in the Mediterranean}}\\n\\n{{IsPartOf|Barcelona (province)}}\\n{{geo|41.3879|2.1699|zoom=12}}\\n{{usablecity}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Events Banner.jpg}}\\nMany cities have regular big cultural and sporting events, which draw tens of thousands of participants and lock up accommodation and transport; but it\\u2019s generally just for a day or so. Those listed here are really ''really'' big events, which may draw millions, locking up not just the city but much of the country over an extended period. If you aim to be there, especially as an independent traveller, you must plan over a year in advance. If you\\u2019re not interested in the event itself, come another time, perhaps a few months later when the place has returned to normal but all the new infrastructure and amenities are there for you. What you can't do is dabble, going to the area thinking you might sort-of drop in on the event, as mega-crowds will be ahead of you. \\n\\n== Upcoming events ==\\n[[File:Cormet de Roselend Tour de France 2018.jpg | thumb | 300px | Tour de France may block the only access road ]]\\n: Big sports tournaments are synchronised with the four-year Olympic cycle, so dates and venues are usually announced at least that far ahead. Olympic and FIFA World Cup hosts may be known over a decade ahead, as that is the lead time for building new stadiums and metro extensions, but not with firm dates you could plan around.   \\n\\n* '''4 - 9 June 2025''' (1446 AH): [[Hajj]] in [[Mecca]] - The key pilgrimage in Islam, drawing some 2 million registered pilgrims. Another million may attend unofficially, as they live in the region and don\\u2019t need visas. Most pilgrims also visit [[Medina]] 450 km northeast. \\n\\n* '''2-27 July 2025:''' UEFA Women's Euro Finals in Switzerland for national soccer teams. Previous women's tournaments were big events but not mega-big on the scale of the men's. But the delayed 2021 Euros and the 2023 World Cup in Australia / NZ has boosted the audience and participation in women's soccer. Matches are at St Jakob-Park in [[Basel]], Stadion Wankdorf in [[Bern]], Stade de Gen\\u00e8ve in [[Geneva]], Letzigrund in [[Z\\u00fcrich]], Kybunpark in [[St Gallen]], Swissporarena in [[Lucerne]], Stade de Tourbillon in [[Sion]] and Stockhorn Arena in [[Thun]]. \\n\\n* '''5-27 July 2025:''' [https://www.letour.fr/ Tour de France] is the world's premier on-road men's cycle race, and this year starts in [[Lille]]. It's a huge event because of the size of the sporting and commercial entourages, and the roving spectators. Especially in the mountains with only a single connecting road, whole areas become locked down, and even fire trucks struggle for access. ''Giro'' in Italy in May and ''Vuelta'' in Spain in Aug / Sept are locally disruptive but on nothing like this scale. \\n\\n* '''22 Aug - 27 Sept 2025:''' Women's Rugby World Cup (union) in England for 16 national teams. As with soccer, women's RU is starting to draw large audiences. Matches are at London Twickenham, [[Brighton]] & Hove Albion Stadium, [[Bristol]] Ashton Gate, [[Exeter]] Sandy Park, [[Northampton (England) | Northampton]] Franklin's Gardens, [[York]] Community Stadium, [[Salford]] Community Stadium near Manchester, and [[Sunderland]] Stadium of Light. \\n\\n* '''21 Dec 2025 - 18 Jan 2026:''' Africa Cup of Nations held in Morocco, with 24 men's national soccer teams competing. It was to be in Guinea, but their facilities were inadequate. The venues are Ibn Batouta Stadium in [[Tangier]], Moulay Abdellah Stadium in [[Rabat]], Mohammed V Stadium in [[Casablanca]], Adrar Stadium in [[Agadir]], [[Marrakech]] stadium, and [[Fez]] Stadium. \\n[[File:Marrakech, Morocco (18606447896).jpg | thumb | 300px | Marrakech hosts games in AFCON 2025 ]]\\n* '''6 - 22 Feb 2026:''' Winter Olympics (XXV) in [[Milan]], [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] and half a dozen other resorts in the northeast of Italy. This area is well developed for visitors and has fairly reliable snow. \\n\\n* '''24 - 29 May 2026''' (1447 AH): [[Hajj]] in [[Mecca]] - because it follows a lunar calendar (not a solar-lunar calendar like Easter), it falls 10 to 11 days earlier each year.\\n\\n* '''4 - 26 July 2026:''' Tour de France starts in [[Barcelona]] and spends two days in Catalonia before crossing into France. \\n\\n* '''23 July - 2 Aug 2026:''' Commonwealth Games in [[Glasgow]]. This is a pared-back event using existing facilities at Emirates Arena, Tollcross Swimming Centre, the Scottish Events Campus and Scotstoun stadium. It was to be in Victoria, Australia, but they baulked at the cost, and if Glasgow fails to show a profit that could spell the end of these games.\\n\\n* '''11 June \\u2013 19 July 2026:''' FIFA World Cup Finals in the USA, Canada and Mexico. This is the top soccer tournament for men\\u2019s national teams, with 48 nations participating. The three host nations automatically qualify, and the others will be known by the end of 2025. There are 16 host cities, grouped into three divisions to reduce travelling distance somewhat, but everyone involved will still have to cover a lot of ground. Fans know where their own team will play in the early stages, but the varied fortunes of the tournament mean they don't know their later venues. So this creates a huge travelling army trying to book last-minute accommodation and transport to cities the far side of the country. The three groups are Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Guadalajara in the Western Division; Kansas City, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Monterrey, and Mexico City in the Central Division; and Toronto, Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Miami in the Eastern Division. The San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Boston, New York City, and Miami venues are not within the named cities, but in outlying towns some distance out. All matches in the knockout rounds will be held in the States, with the final in East Rutherford, New Jersey (the \\\"New York City\\\" venue). \\n\\n* '''Jan 2027:''' AFC Asian Cup in [[Saudi Arabia]], with 24 men's national soccer teams competing. Those nations will be known by the end of March 2026, when the three qualification rounds are completed. (Although Saudi Arabia is guaranteed a place as hosts, they are playing in the second round, which doubles as a qualifier for the 2026 World Cup.) The Asian finals will be played at five stadiums in [[Riyadh]], two in [[Jeddah]], two in Dammam and one in [[Khobar]]. (Hosts for 2031 are not yet decided.) Many of the stadiums used for this event will be reused when Saudi Arabia hosts the 2034 World Cup.\\n\\n* '''14 - 19 May 2027''' (1448 AH): [[Hajj]] in [[Mecca]].\\n\\n* '''24 June - 25 July 2027:''' FIFA Women's World Cup in Brazil, with 32 national soccer teams competing. The venues are Maracan\\u00e3 Stadium (aka Jornalist M\\u00e1rio Filho Stadium) in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Arena BRB Man\\u00e9 Garrincha in [[Bras\\u00edlia]], Mineir\\u00e3o in [[Belo Horizonte]], Castel\\u00e3o in [[Fortaleza]], Est\\u00e1dio Beira-Rio in [[Porto Alegre]], Arena Fonte Nova in [[Salvador]], Arena Corinthians in [[S\\u00e3o Paulo]], Arena Pernambuco in [[Recife]], Arena da Amaz\\u00f4nia in [[Manaus]], and Arna Pantanal in [[Cuiab\\u00e1]].\\n\\n* '''19 June \\u2013 18 July 2027:''' Africa Cup of Nations will be jointly hosted by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, with 24 men's national soccer teams competing. Venues are expected to be Moi International Stadium, Nyayo Stadium and Talanta Stadium (not yet built) in [[Nairobi]], Benjamin Mkapa Stadium and Chamazi Stadium in [[Dar es Salaam]], CCM Kirumba Stadium in [[Mwanza]], Mandela National Stadium and Nakivumbo Stadium in [[Kampala]], [[Hoima]] Stadium, Kipchoge Keino Stadium in [[Eldoret]], and Samia Suluhu Hassan Stadium (not yet built) in [[Arusha]]. (Hosts for 2029 are not yet decided.) \\n[[File:Madeena masjid nabavi 12122008230.jpg | thumb | 300px | Most Hajj pilgrims also visit Medina ]] \\n* '''1 Oct - 13 Nov 2027:''' Rugby Union World Cup in Australia, with 24 men's national teams competing. The venues are not yet announced but are likely to involve all the major Australian cities. \\n\\n* '''June - July 2028:''' UEFA Euro Finals across the UK and Ireland, with 24 men's national soccer teams competing. As there are five host nations, they can't all qualify automatically, but will have to scrap it out in qualification groups. The host venues are London Wembley and Tottenham Hotspur stadiums, [[Birmingham (England) | Birmingham]] Villa Park, [[Cardiff]] Millennium Stadium, City of [[Manchester]] Stadium, [[Liverpool]] Everton stadium, [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] St James' Park, [[Glasgow]] Hampden Park, [[Dublin]] Aviva Stadium and [[Belfast]] Casement Park.\\n\\n* '''21 July - 6 Aug 2028:''' Summer Olympics (XXXIV) in Los Angeles. (The host for 2032 is Brisbane.) \\n\\n* '''1-17 Feb 2030:''' Winter Olympics (XXVI) in France, based around Nice, Brian\\u00e7on, Savoie and Haute-Savoie, but with speed-skating in Turin. (The host for 2034 is Salt Lake City.)\\n\\n* '''June - July 2030:''' FIFA World Cup in [[Morocco]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]], with opening matches to be held in [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]]. The 100th anniversary of the (men's) World Cup will see the event encompass three continents.

Partly that's under-reporting but it also reflects the security that cloaks the event, and an inherently healthy set of travelers. Standard advice about care of valuables and avoiding drunks, low-life and traffic should see you through. \\n\\nThe game-changer in 2020 and 2021 of course was the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. As of 2025 this looks to have followed the same trajectory as past flu pandemics: from being a global year-round wildfire it's abated into a winter (or wet season) upsurge controlled by immunisation and rising natural immunity. But if anything could spark a resurgence, it would be the huge crowds at the events described above. Try as they might, those people couldn't \\\"social distance\\\" in the stadium, nor in the congestion around it, on public transport, in pubs or in outdoor big-screen viewing areas. And the problems start well before you arrive, since you must plan and book well in advance, yet the event may be cancelled or the host country not let you in or impose onerous conditions. Big multi-national events can only be as safe as the participating nation with the weakest covid-control. \\n\\nIn less developed places, consider the conventional risks of crowd collapse (as at Hillsborough in Sheffield in 1989) or of transport catastrophes eg through over-crowded ferries capsizing.\\n\\n== See also ==\\n* [[Cultural attractions]]; experiencing mankind's heritage\\n* [[Activities]] for sports and pastimes  \\n* [[World's Fair]] for expos\\n* [[Itineraries]]\\n* [[Natural attractions]]\\n* [[Reasons to travel]]\\n\\n\\n{{PartOfTopic|Travel topics}}\\n{{usabletopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Muntanya_de_Montserrat_banner.jpg|pgname=Montserrat}}\\n\\n:''For the Caribbean island, see [[Montserrat]].''\\n\\n[[file:Vieira Xacobea.svg|thumb|50px|[[Catalan Way of St. James|CWoSJ]] ]]\\n\\n'''[http://www.montserratvisita.com/ Montserrat]''' is a multi-peaked mountain in [[Catalonia]] and part of the [[Montserrat Natural Park]].

The service from the main station is always only one rack railway train per hour, but may be a service every twenty minutes from the rack railway's stop at Monistrol-Vila, so although it is a bit further to walk, you are likely to be better off going through the town there rather than crossing the bridge to the main station.\\n\\nWhen returning, make sure to get off at the right stop, depending on your onward travel option&mdash;by car (Monistrol-Vila, first stop from the top) or by train/bus (Monistrol de Montserrat, second stop from the top).

These lead to the hermitage of Santa Magdalena, and to Sant Jeroni, the highest point of Montserrat. At an altitude of 1,237 m, almost all of Catalonia can be seen from Sant Jeroni, and on a clear day, the island of Majorca is visible. The trails are well marked with signs along the way, but you may still want to pick up a map at the tourist information office first. At the upper station of the Funicular de Sant Joan, there\\u2019s a sign with a map, listing the four trails as:\\n\\n* Trail '''1''' connects the upper station of the Funicular de Sant Joan and Sant Jeroni, the summit. The trail also passes two other viewing points, and the chapel of Sant Jeroni. A return trip takes about 2 hours.\\n* Trail '''2''' connects the monastery and a junction on the first trail. It can be used as an alternative route to, or back down from, the Sant Jeroni summit. It also passes by the hermitage of Santa Anna and the chapel of Sant Bennet. Note that compared to the first trail, the second trail covers a bigger height difference in a shorter distance; there are some steep steps along the way. It takes about an hour for a single trip.\\n* Trail '''3''' connects the upper and lower stations of the Funicular de Sant Joan. It\\u2019s used as a driving route by staff, so it can be easily walked, which takes about 40 minutes.\\n* Trail '''3a''' connects the upper station of the Funicular de Sant Joan and the hermitage of Santa Magdalena. There\\u2019s a viewing point along the way, as well as the chapel of Sant Joan, and the hermitages of Sant Joan and Sant Onofre. A return trip takes about 45 minutes. Note that this trail has sections with little shade, so you may want to avoid walking it in midday sun.\\n\\nAlthough trail 2 is listed as less difficult than trail 1 on the tourist information signs, the easiest trip to and from Sant Jeroni seems to be to follow trail 1, using the funicular to get to its starting point and to return the same way.\\n\\n\\n[[Way of St. James]] - Catalan segment from [[El Port de la Selva]] or [[Llan\\u00e7\\u00e0]] to [[Montserrat (Spain)]] to the Way of St.James - Ebro segment, passes the site.\\n\\n== Buy ==\\nAs you exit the rack railway or cable car, there is a fairly large curio shop across the way that carries a variety of tourist items, including Catalonian olive oil, chocolate, liqueur, books, jewellery, clothing, religious articles, and toys, as well as monastery-related goods such as recordings of the choir and guidebooks. There is another gift shop at the entrance to the museum that offers different items.\\n\\nThere is also a marketplace, which offers many delectable homemade goods sold by locals, including honey, pastries, preserves, cured meat and sweets. You will also find 2 local cheeses, produced only in Montserrat.\\n\\n==Eat and drink==\\nRestaurants in Montserrat around the monastery exist but are expensive.\\n\\nIt's a good idea to bring your own lunch, especially if you plan to walk away from the central area or go up the funicular to the top of the mountain. There is no restaurant at Sant Jeroni, although there is a cafe adjoining gift shop where the rack railway and cable cars terminate at their upper ends (at the bottom of the Sant Jeroni and Santa Cova funiculars). If you're coming from Barcelona, a good plan is to get up early and head to La Boqueria, the big open market near the head of Las Ramblas, to stock up on sandwich ingredients and snacks - bread, cheese, meat, olives, wine, etc. Pack it up and bring it with you.\\n\\n* {{eat\\n| name=El Rincon cafe and bar | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=Montserrat-Aeri rail station | lat=41.59170 | long=1.85362 | directions=Off the northern end of the active platform\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2016-09-02\\n| content=Simple bar and outdoor cafe serving freshly prepared snacks, sandwiches and paella.\\n}}\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nAlthough the town of Montserrat is relatively safe and tourist-friendly, it can be very dangerous for hiking as much of it is uncharted woodland.

Their site has a directory listing an enormous number of races worldwide. The [https://www.worldathletics.org/ International Amateur Athletics Federation] (IAAF) also has a long list. There is also a [[w:List of marathon races|list on Wikipedia]].\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n\\nMany people travel for marathons, so lodging selection is important.  For major marathons the influx of visitors can overwhelm local lodging options, so plan to book well in advance.  Marathons will typically involve shutting down the roads along the course, so transportation to the starting line on race day can be tricky - if you can book a hotel that is close to public transit or near the starting line your marathon experience is likely to be much less stressful.\\n\\nParticularly if you aren't an experienced marathoner, expect to feel pretty brutalized after completing the course.  Most people won't want to spend hours driving or on a plane immediately after putting their body through twenty-six miles of punishment, so booking a hotel for multiple nights - at least the night before and the night after the marathon - is a plan that you are unlikely to regret.\\n\\n==Stay healthy==\\nAccording to legend, the first marathon runner dropped dead just after finishing the run. That story may not be accurate, but certainly a marathon puts considerable strain on the body. No-one should attempt the race, or even serious training for it, without first talking to their doctor.\\n\\nThere are two water-related dangers; [[dehydration]] is uncomfortable, debilitating and dangerous, quite definitely not good for you. On the other hand excessive consumption of fluids can lead to [[hyponatraemia]], a reduction of sodium levels in the blood that is ''sometimes fatal for long-distance runners''.\\n\\nMany competitors find it necessary to work out a detailed '''hydration plan''' in advance so that they can avoid both dehydration and hyponatraemia on race day. Doing this right requires precise advice tailored to your body; '''consult a doctor''' with expertise in sports medicine.\\n\\nSome marathons are run at high altitudes; for those, [[altitude sickness]] is an issue. Anyone should at least give themselves a few days to acclimatize before the race, and adjust their hydration plan since altitude can also cause dehydration. Serious competitors will need to train at altitude, and most of the top Ethiopian and Kenyan runners grew up at high altitude. \\n\\n{{usabletopic}}\\n\\n{{PartOfTopic|Running}}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.6157236156721606, "reason": "The actual output provides additional details about temperature and best visiting times, which are not in the expected output but do not contradict it.

It borders the iconic Pebble Beach golf course and is the entry point to the 17-Mile Drive and its dramatic ocean views. Note that the 17-mile-drive has a toll as well.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Monterey (California)|Monterey]]|wikidata=Q487315}} - Founded in 1770, Monterey was the capital of Alta California under both Spain and Mexico, was a bustling fishing port until the 1950s, and is now a major tourist destination.  Attractions include a pier filled with seafood restaurants, a world-class aquarium, a harbor that is home to an enormous number of seabirds, sea lions, sea otters, seals, and other marine life, the historic Cannery Row, and opportunities for [[whale watching]], kayaking, or other excursions into Monterey Bay.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Morro Bay]]|wikidata=Q605491}} - This coastal town is best known for the massive 581-foot (177-m) tall volcanic rock that dominates its harbor, but is also a great spot to see marine mammals and is home to one of California's oldest fine art and craft shows.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Paso Robles]]|wikidata=Q586528}} - Paso Robles is a historical resort town known for its hot springs.

The Spanish colonialists traveled along the Central Coast along a route called [[El Camino Real]] \\u2013 roughly on the route of [[Pacific Coast Highway|Highway 1]] \\u2013 and created missions at Santa Cruz, San Juan Bautista, Carmel, Soledad, Jolon, San Miguel, San Luis Obispo, Lompoc, Solvang, Santa Barbara, and San Buenaventura (Ventura). Depending on what you count as Central Coast, the area has about half of the state's missions.\\n\\nMuch of the Central Coast is agricultural, with an emphasis on crops that flourish in relatively cool, coastal climates \\u2013 such as artichokes and strawberries. Grape-growing, especially in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties, is now an important sector. The Santa Barbara County wine country was made famous in the movie ''Sideways''. Monterey County is a renowned wine region, with more than {{acre|40,000}} planted in premium wine grapes. Fishing was once an important part of the regional economy, but has receded greatly. There is oil production off the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, but activity is greatly below previous levels.\\n\\nTourism is a critical industry, particularly on the Monterey Peninsula and around Santa Barbara. The temperate Central Coast has also been known as a retirement area, particularly for people from Los Angeles.\\n\\nPopulation in the Central Coast is concentrated in a series of small to medium-sized cities, only two of which exceed 100,000. The cities include Monterey, fast growing Salinas (a few miles inland), Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara. Santa Cruz city and county are sometimes considered part of the Central Coast, but they have become increasingly tied to the [[Bay Area|San Francisco Bay Area]] and especially Silicon Valley (Santa Clara County), to which many Santa Cruzans commute. Ventura County, at the southern end of the Central Coast, is classified by the Census Bureau as part of the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area and is also a part of that city's media market, and commuter train service to LA is available.\\n\\nThe Central Coast has a large number of colleges, considering its relatively small population (about 2 million of California's 37 million). There are University of California branches at Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara, each of which strongly shapes the character of its city. California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) is the mainstay for the city of San Luis Obispo. There are newer state colleges at Ventura and at Fort Ord, a converted military base in Monterey County.\\n\\nThe '''Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary''' runs from north of the Golden Gate Bridge at San Francisco, to [[Cambria (California)|Cambria]] in [[San Luis Obispo County]], and is the largest marine sanctuary in the United States.

Two-lane Highway 1, also known as the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] is the slower, more scenic option as it winds along the entire Central Coast coastline.\\n\\n===By plane===\\nThere are commercial airports near Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara (the largest), and Santa Maria. There are no flights within the Central Coast, only flights to and from San Francisco and Los Angeles.

If you want to stretch the trip out over several days, Paso Robles and Santa Barbara are convenient towns to stop in, as they have hotels within an easy walk of their train stations.\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara can be reached on Amtrak's [https://www.amtrak.com/routes/pacific-surfliner-train.html Pacific Surfliner], which runs to and from Los Angeles and San Diego several times each day.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n[[File:MissionCarmelSEGL2.jpg|thumb|300px|Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in Carmel, built in 1771 as the second of the 21 missions established by the Spanish in California.]]\\n\\nUS Highway 101 is a freeway virtually its entire length. It connects San Jose, Salinas, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Oxnard with Los Angeles. The Monterey Peninsula is a few miles to the west. Outside of the Monterey Peninsula there are few towns of any size off 101; Lompoc in Santa Barbara County is one.\\n\\nThe rail route essentially follows 101, which was built along the rail corridor. There is only one train a day \\u2013 the Coast Starlight \\u2013 that covers the whole corridor.

Nestled around two of these peaks is San Luis Obispo (\\\"SLO\\\", \\\"slow\\\", or \\\"San Luis\\\" to locals), a small college town that also is one of California's oldest communities. San Luis and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing; outstanding natural beauty; a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission; a small but thriving art gallery scene; and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.\\n\\n===Getting Oriented===\\nSan Luis Obispo is bounded by the imposing line of Cuesta Ridge to the northeast, the Irish Hills to the southwest, dramatic Bishop Peak to the northwest and Islay Hill to the southeast. The town clusters around the feet of the 1,000-foot (300-meter) Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white \\\"M\\\" (for Mission High School). Both locals and visitors frequently refer to Cerro San Luis as \\\"Madonna Mountain\\\" and a common misconception is that the \\\"M\\\" represents the surname \\\"Madonna;\\\" the famous Madonna Inn sits at the foot of the mountain and the city of San Luis Obispo negotiated public access to the peak with the Madonna family. Cal Poly sits hard against Cuesta Ridge (with its big white \\\"P\\\") and the downtown area runs from Cerro San Luis roughly toward campus around two parallel streets, Higuera and Monterey. Most restaurants, bars and shops are located on Higuera Street, nearer the Mission and Cerro San Luis; hotels are mostly located on Monterey Street, nearer the university but still within a mile (2 km) of the central downtown. A few restaurants are located in the charming Railroad District, about 5 blocks east of Higuera via Santa Rosa Street, near the train station and youth hostel.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Visitors Center | alt= | url=http://visitslo.com/ | email=visitorcenter@slochamber.org\\n| address=895 Monterey St. | lat= | long= | directions=in the same building as the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, on the corner of Morro and Monterey Streets in the heart of downtown\\n| phone=+1 805 781-2777 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Su-W 10AM-5PM; Th-Sa 10AM-7PM | price=\\n| content=The Visitor Center offers San Luis Obispo city maps, visitor guides, books about San Luis Obispo, and San Luis Obispo souvenirs.

Take Los Osos Valley Road {{convert|10|miles}} west of town to a park named one of the state's best-kept secrets by the L.A. Times a few years back, and with good reason; it's filled with an abundance of hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails both along the ocean along the bluffs and inland into the coastal peaks; a dramatic cove with caves that kids and adults love; and miles of sandy beach and tidal pools. Trails range from casual ambles along the bluffs to the steep climbs up Valencia and Oats Peaks. Oats is the longer hike (about 5.5 miles / 9 km) but more rewarding, as it offers views of Valencia against the Pacific, as well as northward and eastward to the Nine Sisters and Cuesta Ridge; the trail also is less steep. A terrific nine-mile (14-km) loop can be made by continuing over the summit to the Coon Creek trail, then crossing back in front of the range along Rattlesnake Flats Trail. Take water! The \\\"Mountain of Gold\\\" also reigns as a popular out-and-back destination for the many road cyclists in the county, but cyclists ride westward early as strong winds pick up through Los Osos Valley in the early afternoon.\\n*Walk or bike to '''Poly Canyon'''.

Public vehicles are not allowed to drive on it, though be alert for university vehicles travelling up and down on occasion and student runners/cyclists.\\n* Kayaks and other outdoor gear can be rented at reasonable prices by students and the public from '''Poly Escapes''' on the Cal Poly campus. Kayaking is possible in many places in the county, but the most exciting place to kayak is between Shell Beach and Pismo Beach where there are sea caves you can explore. There are guided tours of the so-called \\\"Dinosaur Caves\\\" available from several kayak rental shops in Pismo Beach.\\n*{{do\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Children's Museum | alt= | url=https://www.slocm.org/ | email=info@slocm.org\\n| address=1010 Nipomo Street | lat=35.278921 | long=-120.666103 | directions=\\n| phone=+1 805 544-5437 | tollfree=\\n| hours=Th-M 10AM-4PM | price=\\n| lastedit=2024-03-07\\n| content=Nipomo and Monterey.

It borders the iconic Pebble Beach golf course and is the entry point to the 17-Mile Drive and its dramatic ocean views. Note that the 17-mile-drive has a toll as well.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Monterey (California)|Monterey]]|wikidata=Q487315}} - Founded in 1770, Monterey was the capital of Alta California under both Spain and Mexico, was a bustling fishing port until the 1950s, and is now a major tourist destination.  Attractions include a pier filled with seafood restaurants, a world-class aquarium, a harbor that is home to an enormous number of seabirds, sea lions, sea otters, seals, and other marine life, the historic Cannery Row, and opportunities for [[whale watching]], kayaking, or other excursions into Monterey Bay.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Morro Bay]]|wikidata=Q605491}} - This coastal town is best known for the massive 581-foot (177-m) tall volcanic rock that dominates its harbor, but is also a great spot to see marine mammals and is home to one of California's oldest fine art and craft shows.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Paso Robles]]|wikidata=Q586528}} - Paso Robles is a historical resort town known for its hot springs.

Hiking through the impressive rock formations is the primary recreational opportunity, although bird watchers will enjoy the possibility of seeing the highly endangered California condor.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Lone Cypress 17-Mile Drive 2013.jpg|thumb|300px|The iconic Lone Cypress on the 17-Mile Drive near Carmel.]]\\n\\nThe Central Coast includes some of the classic tourist country of California \\u2013 particularly the scenic version of the drive (or train ride) from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The Spanish colonialists traveled along the Central Coast along a route called [[El Camino Real]] \\u2013 roughly on the route of [[Pacific Coast Highway|Highway 1]] \\u2013 and created missions at Santa Cruz, San Juan Bautista, Carmel, Soledad, Jolon, San Miguel, San Luis Obispo, Lompoc, Solvang, Santa Barbara, and San Buenaventura (Ventura). Depending on what you count as Central Coast, the area has about half of the state's missions.\\n\\nMuch of the Central Coast is agricultural, with an emphasis on crops that flourish in relatively cool, coastal climates \\u2013 such as artichokes and strawberries. Grape-growing, especially in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties, is now an important sector. The Santa Barbara County wine country was made famous in the movie ''Sideways''. Monterey County is a renowned wine region, with more than {{acre|40,000}} planted in premium wine grapes. Fishing was once an important part of the regional economy, but has receded greatly. There is oil production off the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, but activity is greatly below previous levels.\\n\\nTourism is a critical industry, particularly on the Monterey Peninsula and around Santa Barbara. The temperate Central Coast has also been known as a retirement area, particularly for people from Los Angeles.\\n\\nPopulation in the Central Coast is concentrated in a series of small to medium-sized cities, only two of which exceed 100,000. The cities include Monterey, fast growing Salinas (a few miles inland), Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara. Santa Cruz city and county are sometimes considered part of the Central Coast, but they have become increasingly tied to the [[Bay Area|San Francisco Bay Area]] and especially Silicon Valley (Santa Clara County), to which many Santa Cruzans commute. Ventura County, at the southern end of the Central Coast, is classified by the Census Bureau as part of the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area and is also a part of that city's media market, and commuter train service to LA is available.\\n\\nThe Central Coast has a large number of colleges, considering its relatively small population (about 2 million of California's 37 million). There are University of California branches at Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara, each of which strongly shapes the character of its city. California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) is the mainstay for the city of San Luis Obispo. There are newer state colleges at Ventura and at Fort Ord, a converted military base in Monterey County.\\n\\nThe '''Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary''' runs from north of the Golden Gate Bridge at San Francisco, to [[Cambria (California)|Cambria]] in [[San Luis Obispo County]], and is the largest marine sanctuary in the United States. It hosts spectacular kelp forests and wildly diverse marine life, and is popular for diving, kayaking and whale watching.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By car===\\nUS Highway 101 is the Central Coast's main artery and alternates between freeway and state highway throughout the Central Coast region.  Two-lane Highway 1, also known as the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] is the slower, more scenic option as it winds along the entire Central Coast coastline.\\n\\n===By plane===\\nThere are commercial airports near Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara (the largest), and Santa Maria. There are no flights within the Central Coast, only flights to and from San Francisco and Los Angeles.  It is usually cheaper to fly into adjacent regions, such as flying into the [[San Jose (California)|San Jose]] airport rather than the small Monterey airport, or [[LAX]] rather than Santa Barbara.\\n\\n===By train===\\nAmtrak's [https://www.amtrak.com/routes/coast-starlight-train.html Coast Starlight] train runs nearly the entire length of the Central Coast once each day, from approximately late morning to early evening.  For a driving-free train vacation, you can fly into the San Jose airport, take a bus or taxi to the San Jose Diridon train station, and then go down the coast, eventually to Oxnard or beyond the Central Coast to Los Angeles.  If you want to stretch the trip out over several days, Paso Robles and Santa Barbara are convenient towns to stop in, as they have hotels within an easy walk of their train stations.\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara can be reached on Amtrak's [https://www.amtrak.com/routes/pacific-surfliner-train.html Pacific Surfliner], which runs to and from Los Angeles and San Diego several times each day.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n[[File:MissionCarmelSEGL2.jpg|thumb|300px|Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in Carmel, built in 1771 as the second of the 21 missions established by the Spanish in California.]]\\n\\nUS Highway 101 is a freeway virtually its entire length. It connects San Jose, Salinas, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Oxnard with Los Angeles. The Monterey Peninsula is a few miles to the west. Outside of the Monterey Peninsula there are few towns of any size off 101; Lompoc in Santa Barbara County is one.\\n\\nThe rail route essentially follows 101, which was built along the rail corridor. There is only one train a day \\u2013 the Coast Starlight \\u2013 that covers the whole corridor. The Pacific Surfliners to Los Angeles and San Diego go as far north as San Luis Obispo, there is more service from Santa Barbara south. [[Amtrak]] Thruway buses cover gaps in train service.\\n\\nGreyhound serves Santa Cruz, Salinas, King City, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and Oxnard (but not Ventura), connecting to San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Regional and local buses fill in the gaps.\\n\\n==Go next==\\n* '''[[Southern California]]''' - Bordering the Central Coast to the south, the Southern California region is home to [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]], [[Disneyland]], and miles of famous beaches.\\n* '''[[San Joaquin Valley]]''' - Located east of the Central Coast, this area is the breadbasket of California and home to a large percentage of America's fruit and vegetable supply.

The climate is hot with strong rains in the summer monsoon season.  The vegetation is tropical with parrots and parakeets. The geology is limestone karst with numerous underground rivers feeding springs, sinks, world-renowned caves, gorgeous waterfalls and turquoise-hued rivers.  The prevalence of tropical diseases led to slow development of the region until modern times which allowed the native culture to be preserved.  The Huastec split off from the Maya before the flowering of that culture and are one of the oldest still-existing cultures in Mexico. The most well-known tribe of Nahuatl speakers is the Culhua-Mexica of the Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco City-States, who are often just labeled as Aztecs, in other words the people or inhabitants of Aztlan, the original and legendary homeland for all Nahuatl speakers.\\n\\nThe heart of the Huastec region is south of Ciudad Valles in the rugged mountains jutting from the coastal plains in a place where there are many nacimientos (springs) that supplied water.  Their T\\u00e9nek language has helped trace their origin to the Maya before their ascendency, passing in their migration through the Olmec, the mother culture of the pre-hispanic Mexican civilization, and then through the Totonac to settle in the Panuco basin.  There are about 90,000 Huastec and in one municipality (county) 90% speak Tenek.\\n\\nNahuatl is spoken by about 130,000 people in San Luis Potos\\u00ed.  They are concentrated around Tamazunchale and to the south in the state of Hildago where 23% are monolingual Nahuatl speakers.\\n\\nWhile 90% of the Huastec are located in only 11 of the 20 municipalities that form the Huasteca Potosina, their influence is felt throughout the region which takes great pride in their culture.\\n\\nThe Huasteca Potosina is a fairly popular tourist area for Mexicans but remains unknown to foreign tourists that primarily head to Mexican beaches.  [[Caves|Cavers]] have long been drawn to this area, and kayakers have discovered the rivers and waterfalls.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\nThere is no airport in the Huasteca Potosina region. The nearest airports with commercial flights are San Luis Potosi {{IATA|SLP}} or Tampico {{IATA|TAM}}. International visitors can fly to Mexico City {{IATA|MEX}} and make a connecting flight, or can take a bus to Ciudad Valles (the largest city in the Huasteca Potosina) or Xilitla.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nThe two best gateway cities for the Huasteca Potosina would be '''[[Ciudad Valles]]''' or '''[[Xilitla]]'''. Ciudad Valles is served by first-class long-distance bus lines, and Xilitla is primarily served by second-class buses. Both cities have hotels and restaurants to serve traveler needs though Ciudad Valles is the larger of the two cities and has a better choice of traveler services. From these cities, you can arrange day trips to the region's parks, biosphere reserves, small towns, and archaeological sites. \\n\\n* '''Ciudad Valles''' - about 4 hours by first-class bus from San Luis Potosi (M$600). Autonaves buses (Grupo Vencedor) depart hourly from San Luis Potosi. Futura Select and Omnibus de Mexico each have 2 buses per day and Estrella Blanca has 3 buses per day. Tampico is about 3 hours by first-class bus from Ciudad Valles, Autonaves buses operate hourly between the two cities (M$300). \\n\\n* '''Xilitla''' - about 4 hours by second-class bus from Tampico on Grupo Vencedor (M$400), buses depart 4 times per day. About 7 hours from San Luis Potosi by Grupo Vencedor second-class bus (M$500), 3 buses per day.\\n\\n===By car===\\nThe Careterra Nacional (MEX 85) is the major north-south highway through the region.

The boom continued for nearly two centuries until the big silver lodes were depleted.\\n\\nThe Bajio is an area rich in history. In the 17th and 18th century, it was the backbone of Spain's route to the riches of the New World as the ''Camino Real'' was blazed (Camino Real de la Tierra Adentro (a UNESCO World Heritage site) begins in Queretaro and extends north into what is now the United States, ending in Santa Fe, New Mexico). In the early 19th century, the Bajio was central to Mexican Independence. In 1810, Father Miguel Hidalgo proclaimed freedom in the Bajio town of Dolores (now known as [[Dolores Hidalgo]]). In 1867, the illegitimate empire of Maximilian I was ended in [[Queretaro]], where Meximilian was tried and convicted and then executed by firing squad. The Bajio saw its share of political machinations and outright battles during the Revolution of the early 20th century. In 1915, Pancho Villa's Division del Norte was defeated at [[Celaya]].\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By plane===\\n\\n* '''Aeropuerto Internacional de Guanajuato''' (Aeropuerto de Bajio) {{IATA|BJX}} is the largest airport in the Bajio region. It is centrally located, midway between Guanajuato and Leon. The airport has flights to most major Mexican airports and receives international flights from Houston, Dallas, and Chicago. \\n* '''Queretaro Intercontinental Airport''' {{IATA|QRO}} offers domestic flights to major Mexican airports and international flights to Houston and Dallas. QRO is the hub airport for regional carrier TAR.\\n* '''San Luis Potosi Aeropuerto Internacional Ponciano Arriaga''' {{IATA|SLP}} is a regional airport serving major Mexican hubs and international flights.\\n\\nAlthough not part of the Bajio region, [[Benito Juarez International Airport]] (MEX) in [[Mexico City]] can be a good gateway airport for travelers to the Bajio region because the airport has an in-terminal bus station with frequent direct buses to cities in the Bajio.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nBus service is outstanding throughout the Bajio region. All major cities have large central bus stations with frequent service throughout the region. Buses to cities in the Bajio region depart Mexico City from the Terminal del Norte. Several regional lines serve smaller towns.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\n===By bus===\\nBus service in the Bajio region is excellent. Major bus lines operate executive-class and first-class buses between all major cities in the region. The only cities that are a bit inconvenient for buses are Queretaro (which has its main bus station outside the core downtown on an outlying trunk highway) and San Luis Potosi (which doesn't have one single Central de Autobuses, but instead has different company specific terminals on the outskirts). See the [[Mexico#By_bus|Mexico]] article for general information about using buses in Mexico.\\n\\nA variety of second-class lines operate local buses to all small cities and will stop for passengers almost anywhere along a major highway. \\n\\nHere's a few representative routes with fares in January 2023:\\n\\n* Leon to/from Guanajuato, Aguascalientes, or Zacatecas - 2-1/2 hours, M$300-400, executive and first-class buses on each of these routes operate about every 15 minutes (ETN, Futura, Primera Plus)\\n* Aguascalientes to San Luis Potosi - 3 hours, Estrella Blanca buses run every couple hours, M$150 on a second-class bus (Rojo de los Altos) to M$500 on an ejecutivo-class bus (Futura Select)\\n* Queretaro to San Miguel de Allende - 1-1/2 hour, M$200, buses go every hour (Futura Select, ETN)\\nGuanajuato to Queretaro - 2-1/2 hours, M$300, ETN\\n\\n===By taxi===\\nTaxis are the best option for getting around within a given city, but they might work out for longer distances too. Many of the cities and tourist sites are close enough that the convenience and flexibility of the taxi might be worth the price difference of the bus.\\n\\n==See==\\n* '''Franciscan missions''' in the Sierra Gordo of [[Quer\\u00e9taro]]. UNESCO World heritage site.\\n* '''Colonial city centers''', many historic silver mining cities, such as that in [[Zacatecas]], which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \\n* '''San Marcos Fair''' (es: ''Feria Nacional de San Marcos''), in [[Aguascalientes (state)|Aguascalientes]]. The unofficial national fair of Mexico.  Held for three or four weeks beginning around the end of April.\\n* '''Las Siete Luminarias''' in Valle de Santiago.\\n* '''Camino Real de Tierra Adentro''' is the historic \\\"Royal Road\\\" silver mining road, passing through numerous charming towns (a UNESCO World Heritage Site)\\n\\n==Do==\\n* '''Bullfights''' - San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas are known for having some of the best bullfights (as well as the best bulls and matadores) of any Mexican city. The bullfighting season is generally centered around the summer and fall months. Tickets should be purchased in advance as the fights typically sell out.\\n* '''San Marcos Fair''' (''Feria Nacional de San Marcos'') - Aguascalientes hosts Mexico's biggest and boldest festival for 3 weeks in late April (San Marcos Day is April 25). The fair includes a carnival midway, a livestock show, bullfights, a beauty pageant, numerous concerts from top performers, and food stands galore.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nThere are some wonderful restaurants in the colonial silver mining towns that make up the Bajio region. Most restaurants serve food that is similar to food in other parts of Mexico, but there are some regional specialties to be aware of. \\n\\n* '''queso guaje''' - an artesanal cheese from the [[Huasteca Potosina]] region\\n* '''cajeta''' - a caramel sauce made from goats milk, popular throughout Mexico, it originates from [[Celaya]]\\n* '''empanadas de picadillo''' - pastry stuffed with spiced ground beef\\n* '''enchilados mineros''' - enchiladas stuffed with diced potatoes, grated cheese, and a guajillo chile sauce, a specialty in [[Guanajuato]], but served throughout the Bajio\\n* '''cuete encacahuatado''' - a hearty, and very unusual main dish, thick-sliced roast beef is covered in a peanut and tomato sauce spiced with cloves, pepper, and cinnamon\\n* '''pipian''' is a type of mole originating in [[Oaxaca (city)|Oaxaca]], but it's become the dominant kind of mole in the Bajio\\n\\n==Drink==\\nMexico is generally a beer drinking country, and the Bajio region is no exception. The big national brands can be found everywhere, but more interesting are the beers being produced by the young craft brewers opening up local brewpubs and regional craft breweries. The phrase to use when asking waiters for a good, local beer is ''cerveza artesanal''. Quite a few restaurants and bars serve craft beers, you just need to ask.  \\n\\nIn Bajio, brewpubs and beer bars are in all the major cities. Some are chains, like \\\"The Beer Company\\\" (at least 5 locations in Bajio), but there are also many locally owned pubs serving unique beers that are often quite distinctive. \\n\\nArtesanal craft breweries are generally located in Queretaro or Guanajuato. The breweries may offer tours (see the \\\"Drink\\\" section in  individual city articles in this region for details). Regional craft beers available in the Bajio as of 2023 include beers from Hercules, Toro, and Tlaxco.\\n\\nWine is becoming increasingly popular in the Bajio, where several young winemakers have built cellars in various parts of the region. [[Queretaro (state)|Queretaro]] is particularly interesting with three very large wine producers centered around the town of [[Ezequiel Montes]] and a growing number of artesanal wineries in the same area, which the state is now promoting as the ''Ruta del Vino''. The state has an annual wine and cheese festival in the town of [[Tequisquiapan]].\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nMost of the Bajia region is relatively safe for travelers, but normal precautions are wise. You should also research current events for any region you travel to in order to find out about recent safety concerns. See [[Mexico#Be_safe|the main Mexico article]] for country-wide safety concerns. As of December 2022, the U.S. State Department advises against travel in [[Zacatecas]] and to use caution in Guanajuato's southern cities (such as [[Celaya]], [[Irapuato]], and [[Salamanca]]). \\n\\n==Go next==\\nIf you follow the [[Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]] (historic silver mining route), you could go north into the wide open spaces of [[Northern Mexico]], or southeast into [[Central Mexico]], with its wealth of museums and cultural attractions.\\n\\n{{usableregion}}\\n\\n{{geo|21.52207|-101.06598|zoom=9}}\\n\\n{{isPartOf|Mexico}}\", \"{{pagebanner|WV banner San Luis Obispo County Carrizo Plain National Monument.jpg}}\\n'''[https://www.slocal.com/ San Luis Obispo County]''' is in the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] of [[California]] in the [[United States of America]].

For a multi-purpose capital, though, it's very small, with a permanent population of only 899 people (as of the 2016 census), who live on the shore of Hudson Bay, the bank of the Churchill River, and just past the treeline of the [[boreal forest]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n\\n===Origins===\\n\\nThe earliest inhabitants of the region were the Thule people, the proto-Inuit, who arrived around 1,000 BCE before moving north in search of colder pastures, leaving the territory principally to the Chipewyan and Swampy Cree aboriginal groups. See [[Indigenous cultures of North America]].\\n[[File:Churchill Wildlife Management Area polar bear10.JPG|thumb|320px|Polar Deadpan]]\\nThe first European camp here was a Danish expedition in 1619. The cold got to them; the three of 64 who survived the winter set sail for home as soon as the ice would permit.\\n\\nThe town as we know it finds its roots in the history of the Hudson's Bay Company, which in 1717 established a year-round trading post just north of the modern-day town across the Churchill River, joining in the [[In_the_footsteps_of_explorers#North_American_fur_traders|fur trade]] in northwest America, largely through deals with the tundra-dwelling Chipewyan.\\n\\nOwing to English worries about potential French aggressors, the post was moved south in the 1730s to a massive stone star fort, Prince of Wales, which is very visible from the town, being just across the river. In 1782 the French Hudson Bay Expedition arrived and captured the badly outnumbered civilian fort garrison without a shot, raided the supplies, but failed in the attempt to demolish this rather well constructed fort. The Governor Samuel Hearne, one of Canada's great explorers, returned the next year and set up shop once more. The same French expedition also took York Factory, 200km to the south, then the capital of the Hudson Bay Company and today uninhabited.\\n\\nThe trading post and river were named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (an ancestor of Winston Churchill), who was governor of the Hudson's Bay Company in the late 17th century.\\n\\nOver the centuries, the fur trade waned, and Churchill might have disappeared, were it not for the ambitious attempts by provincial governments to secure a northern port in central Canada (motivated by the desire to break the monopoly of the Canadian Pacific Railway on grain exports). After more than a decade of construction across the northern forests, the rail line from [[Winnipeg]] was finished in 1929, and the Port of Churchill would become the city's economic centre until wheat shipments began to decline in 2012. As grains could be transported less expensively by rail to [[Prince Rupert]] in the west or the Port of [[Montreal]] in the east, Churchill's seaport languished; the facilities were closed in 2016. The tracks were washed out in various places by May 2017 flooding; Denver-based Omnitrax (the owner of the port and railway at the time) refused to repair the damage, leaving Churchill severed overland until the line was sold in 2018. The new owners rebuilt the railway, and passenger trains resumed in December 2018.\\n\\n===The bears===\\n{{infobox|Bear Patrol|If we can't just shoot them, how to keep them from moving into town? It's a legitimate question (they are, after all, godless killing machines), and not one easily answered, but the people of Churchill have become incredibly sophisticated about it. If anyone spots a bear near town\\u2014and they get spotted quick\\u2014they call +1 204-675-BEAR (2327), and then the bear patrol comes out. Within a minute or two, a bunch of pickups topped with big spotlights will roll up to the coast and warn off anyone from walking in the area. They quietly monitor and encourage the bears to just move through, since tranquillizing poses two problems: 1. Drugged up polar bears tend to run off out of sight and fall asleep somewhere. 2. What do you do with a drugged up sleeping polar bear? The answer to number two is the most ingenious of all: put them in jail. <br><br>Yes, '''polar bear jail'''. It's a big old aircraft hangar by the airport with an awful lot of reinforced steel and some very angry 1200 pounders banging on the walls, who just couldn't be enticed to stay out of town. When the bay freezes over, the \\\"wardens\\\" tranquillize the bears inside and ''airlift them by helicopter'' about three river systems north of town, which is just enormous enough of a distance to keep the bears from walking right back to town. You'll know the bears that have been captured right away\\u2014not because of the tag on their backs, but because they break into an uncharacteristic sprint at the sound of helicopters!}}\\nThe Hudson's Bay Company traders were hardy folks, and presumably didn't mind living right in the middle of a major polar bear migration route. The problem of living just north of a giant polar bear colony was always solved rather neatly by shooting any bears wandering into town with shotguns.\\n\\nStarting around the 1960s, non-locals started taking an interest in the bears, in studying them, photographing them, and generally admiring the intense over-sized cuteness. Locals saw opportunity, stopped shooting the bears, and began the process of converting the town from a minor industrial centre to one of the world's northernmost tourist towns. Live polar bear webcams are operated by conservation group Polar Bear International with backing from Frontier North Adventures and [http://explore.org/channels/polar-bears/view-all/ explore.org].\\n\\nThe Western Hudson Bay bear colony is home to roughly 1,000 bears, which summer in Wapusk National Park. Polar bears hunt seals on the sea ice, but when the ice breaks up, they are forced to return to land where they fast until the ice forms again. Prime bear season is October and November leading up to the ice formation, when the colony heads north from the park (and towards Churchill) to get ready for the first freeze. While they wait, they snack intermittently on whatever is around. Kelp buried in snow seems to be a favorite. Things are kind of dull when the ice isn't in, so these curious animals will wander right over to you to give you a good sniff or taste. The taste bit is not a joke\\u2014polar bears' sense of taste is so powerful that you will see them regularly ''licking the air'' to discern what tastes are out there!\\n\\nThe bears are a threatened species, mainly due to human encroachment on their habitat. Canada has restrictions on [[hunting]] them, but does allow hunting by the native peoples and even some sport hunting for those who can afford $20,000 or more for an expedition. None of the allowed hunting is in the Churchill area.\\n\\n===The sea canary===\\n\\nBelugas, with their gleaming white skin, big smiles, and canary-like twitter, have every right to claim the title of world's cutest whale. The west Hudson Bay population, one of Canada's seven, comes back from its winters at the Arctic ice cap to roost, er, calf in the Churchill river bed. At this time, the river is ''filled'' with the whales and the zodiac boats are filled with tourists with expensive camera equipment! Up to ''3,000'' whales enter the river each summer.\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Metric\\n| janhigh =   -22.7\\n| febhigh =   -20.4\\n| marhigh =   -14.5\\n| aprhigh =   -5\\n| mayhigh =   3.2\\n| junhigh =   11.4\\n| julhigh =   17.3\\n| aughigh =   16.3\\n| sephigh =   8.8\\n| octhigh =   1.1\\n| novhigh =   -8.0\\n| dechigh =   -18.8\\n| janlow =   -30.7\\n| feblow =   -28.9\\n| marlow =   -24.4\\n| aprlow =   -14.5\\n| maylow =   -4.6\\n| junlow =   1.7\\n| jullow =   6.8\\n| auglow =   7.2\\n| seplow =   2.5\\n| octlow =   -4.5\\n| novlow =   -16.1\\n| declow =   -26.8\\n| janprecip =  14.8\\n| febprecip =  12.1\\n| marprecip =  18.2\\n| aprprecip =  23.1\\n| mayprecip =  27.3\\n| junprecip =  43.0\\n| julprecip =  54.6\\n| augprecip =  61.7\\n| sepprecip =  53.3\\n| octprecip =  43.7\\n| novprecip =  31.4\\n| decprecip =  18.3\\n| jansun =  7:25\\n| febsun =  9:52\\n| marsun =  12:17\\n| aprsun =  14:57\\n| maysun =  17:17\\n| junsun =  18:25\\n| julsun =  17:21\\n| augsun =  14:59\\n| sepsun =  12:21\\n| octsun =  9:48\\n| novsun =  7:23\\n| decsun =  6:15\\n| description =\\n}}\\n\\n===Climate===\\n\\nThe ''[[Northern Lights|Aurora Borealis]]'' is another good thing to keep tabs on:\\n\\n'''Bears''' can be seen year-round. But the one time of year where they really are everywhere is '''October\\u2013November''', before the sea ice forms. At that time of year, you can feel pretty confident that you will have plenty of photography opportunities every time you go out in a tundra vehicle. At other times, you have to wonder whether you are spending a small fortune on transport to see no bears. November is the really snowy month, so expect worse weather, less sunlight, way colder temperatures, but more pretty snow-covered backdrops for bears to play around in. While the sea ice is a bit unpredictable, it's fairly safe to assume that the last week of bear season is more or less the second to last week of November. Beyond that, you could miss them (and the tundra vehicles stop running anyway).\\n\\n[[File:Cape Churchill fast ice4.JPG|thumb|260px|Shore-fast ice at Cape Churchill, Wapusk National Park]]\\n\\nThe '''belugas''' arrive in mid-June and depart in mid-August. So do the '''bugs''' (especially July). As cute as the belugas are, so are the flies as demonic a plague, so bring long pants, long sleeves, bug spray with DEET, and ideally a bug jacket for the possibility that it gets especially bad.\\n\\n'''Aurora season''' is January\\u2013March, as the nights are longest and the precipitation (ergo cloud cover) lowest. Given how bleak the deep winter months are in terms of cold and lack of animal activity, though, one might speculate that this \\\"season\\\", while ideal for aurora-watching, is a bit manufactured to stimulate tourism in the slow months\\u2014you can see it just fine in November if you have a good night. All you need is a clear dark sky (a new moon is ideal), and good space weather\\u2014if you time your visit to coincide with the peak of an eleven year solar cycle, you'll see more intense lights more frequently.\\n\\n===Prepare===\\n\\nIt's not easy to visit Churchill (during bear season) without going through a tour company, simply because the tundra vehicles often book up quickly and hotels are full; the train and planes ''can'' fill up; and both the buggies and hotels generally require full payment up front with no refunds. You must confirm availability of transport, lodging, and buggy at the same time and then ''immediately'' call them back to book all three. Otherwise you could find yourself stuck with a giant bill for a hotel with no way to get out on the tundra to see the bears, or a giant bill for a buggy with no lodging! Other activities (dog-sledding, car rentals, helicopter tours, etc.), are easy enough to book, even after arriving.\\n\\nOnce you have booked everything, it's time to buy a northern wardrobe:\\n\\n====Summer====\\n[[File:Churchill area map.png|thumb|500px|Churchill area ([[#Get in|see below for town map]]) ]]\\nThe summer poses one problem and that's '''bugs'''. Tiny no-see-ums, run-of-the-mill mosquitoes, hell-spawn big black biting flies, and everything in between. A dry summer could mean little to no bugs, but it's good to err on the side of DEET. June\\u2013August requires insect repellent with DEET. While not necessary, pre-treating some of your clothes with ''specialized'' DEET spray ''for clothing'' probably won't be something you regret. You will see tourists with bug jackets and screen hats, but that's really a little over the top. Light long pants and long-sleeved shirts are a must, though.\\n\\n====Winter====\\nThe '''cold''' in Churchill is spectacular.\\n\\nWhen you are this far north, you will need some serious winter gear November\\u2013March, and potentially in October. Avoid wearing cotton, as cotton gets wet and stays wet. Layers are key, but not enough to keep you warm without a good jacket. If you forgot something, try to pick it up at the Walmart in [[Thompson]], if you are taking the train.\\n\\n*Warm wool (or other warm non-cotton) cap, which fits tightly against your skull\\n*Parka/very well insulated jacket with hood (lined hood ideal)\\n*Protective ski goggles will be especially good for dog sledding, snowmobiling, snow shoeing, or just days with really heavy winds\\n*Waterproof boots, ideally rated for -40\\u00b0C (-40\\u00b0F) or lower. The ratings are often flat out lies, so make sure to consult with a sales person, and let them know just how cold it is where you are going. Avoid boots with rubber toes, as that rubber will freeze, making and keeping your toes very cold. Anything lined with animal skin or fur will be warmest and most comfortable, albeit very expensive.\\n*Long underwear. When in doubt, err on the side of more (merino-) wool.\\n*Wool/fleece pants & sweaters; non-cotton shirts. Moisture wicking gear is good. An outer layer of ski pants is nice for breaking the wind.\\n*Insulated layer underneath your jacket, which will often come with a ski jacket or good parka.\\n*Insulated gloves (i.e., ski gloves)\\n[[File:Polar bear photography from a Tundra Buggy.JPG|thumb|260px|Ready your cameras, polar bear photography from the back of a Tundra Buggy]]\\n*Glove liners\\n*Wool scarf\\n*Neck protector, especially balaclavas.\\n\\nYou should be able to survive without going out and buying a new wardrobe full of expensive luxuries, but getting what you can of the above will make the trip more cosy.\\n\\nFor more on winter clothing, see [[Cold weather#Clothing|Cold weather]].\\n\\n====Other essentials====\\nIf ever there were a case for a good '''camera''', it's a trip to Churchill! Bring/buy the best you can. Digital cameras don't stand up well to the cold, but they will still work. But bring extra batteries and film (if your camera uses it). In the winter, keep back up batteries close to your body to keep them warm, and switch them out when your active battery in your camera gets killed by the cold. If your camera breaks, [[#Buy|Bazlik Jewellers]] can repair it. A long telephoto lens is generally required for wildlife photography; a good zoom lens may be enough but see [[Travel photography]] for a detailed discussion. A waterproof camera is a must if you plan to swim with the Beluga whales in the summer (a GoPro with a waterproof case can be great for video). Bring an extra memory card in case one fails (and the cold can help them fail).\\n\\nPhotographing the '''[[Northern Lights#Photography|aurora]]''' requires different equipment. You will need a camera that supports manual exposure (10 to 40 seconds), a fast, wide-angle lens (aperture f/2.8 or better), fast film (800 ASA or better), or equivalent ISO setting on a digital camera, a strong tripod to hold the long exposure in potential high winds, and ideally a cable release or self-timer to trigger shots without stirring the camera. Again, you will want multiple batteries to swap as they freeze. Insulating the tripod can save your hands from freezing. Do not use any filter.\\n\\nA '''laptop''' is a good idea, if only for uploading your photos, to keep your memory cards free to take more high-resolution shots!\\n\\n'''Binoculars''' are great for wildlife viewing.\\n\\nEspecially in the winter, you will have plenty of downtime, so books and cards/games can be nice to have.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[File:Churchill map.png|thumb|400px|The town of Churchill]]\\n\\nThere are two ways to get to Churchill: airplane and train.\\n\\nThe economy seats on the train make for four nights of uncomfortable sleeping, but are cheap. The expensive sleeper cars are much more stylish, and allow you to enjoy the long-distance train experience watching the ecosystemic change out the windows as you travel north. Or, you can catch the train into Churchill and then take a nice quick, painless flight back when you're weary of your travels.\\n\\nA viable solution for those who would like to get to Churchill faster, while not spending a lot of money is flying from Winnipeg to [[Thompson]], and then taking the train from there.  The airport in Thompson is not within walking distance of the train station, but there are plenty of bored taxi drivers to help you.\\n\\n===By plane===\\n\\n==== Airport ====\\n* {{listing | type=go\\n| name=Churchill Airport | alt={{IATA|YYQ}} | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=58.739167 | long=-94.066389 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Churchill Airport | image=Churchill Manitoba Airport.JPG | wikidata=Q2875820\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n==== Airline ====\\n\\n* {{Listing|name=Calm Air|url=https://www.calmair.com/|tollfree=+1-800-839-2256|lastedit=2022-04-25|content=A regional airline operating flights in [[Manitoba]] and [[Nunavut]].}} Travel time directly to Churchill from [[Winnipeg]] is 2.5 hours.  Calm Air also offers seasonal flights from [[Thompson]] a few times a week.\\n\\nIf you are connecting through Winnipeg to get to or from Churchill, allow plenty of time between flights. As you will have to leave the secure area, collect your baggage (if you have any), check in at the airline desk and go through security. Since the tiny Churchill Airport has no security screening, passengers arriving in Winnipeg exit straight into baggage claim.\\n\\n==== Ground transportation ====\\nThe airport is about a ten-minute taxi ride from town. Most hotels will pick you up if you ask ahead of time. Some package tours use chartered flights from Winnipeg, in which case the tour company takes care of all the logistics.\\n\\n=== By train ===\\n{{Seealso|Rail travel in Canada}}\\n* {{go\\n| name=Churchill Station | alt={{IATA|XAD}} | url=https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/stations/prairies-and-northern-manitoba/churchill | email=\\n| address=1 Mantayo Seepee Meskanow | lat=58.767778 | long=-94.174444 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Churchill station (Manitoba) | wikidata=Q3096230\\n| lastedit=2023-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=VIA Rail Canada | alt= | url=https://www.viarail.ca/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=+1-888-842-7245\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Via Rail | wikidata=Q876720\\n| lastedit=2022-04-07\\n| content=Operates a route two days per week between [[Winnipeg]] and Churchill with stops in [[Portage la Prairie]], [[Dauphin]], [[Roblin]], [[Kamsack]], [[Canora]], [[Hudson Bay (Saskatchewan)|Hudson Bay]], [[The Pas]], and [[Thompson]].

Taking the train to Churchill is much more affordable than flying, but takes much longer. Via Rail serves Churchill with its [http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/prairies-and-northern-manitoba/winnipeg-churchill Hudson Bay line] that begins in Winnipeg. From Winnipeg the train takes about '''38-48 hours'''. You have the option of staying in one of several different sleeper cars, or riding in economy class (depending on how much you want to pay) and trying to find two empty seats to cram yourself into for a miserable night's sleep. Economy supersaver (non-refundable) round-trip tickets run $220-330, while sleeper cars (with showers, couches, and actual sleep) cost $500-900. A two-person cabin runs $1250-1700 per person (prices as of April 2020). Sales for economy class, which can bring the fare down further are published on Via Rail's website every Tuesday (look for the large \\\"Discount Tuesday\\\" banner on the home page). Sales on sleeper tickets are available in a [http://www.viarail.ca/en/deals special section] of the website at all times expect during a general sale and can bring the price down to $500 return.\\n\\nYou cannot drink your own liquor on the train, nor can you smoke. The fines are astronomical! The train will be stopping often, though, and you can hop off at the stops for a cigarette break. The big break is in [[Thompson]], where you'll have two-five hours to get off, shop at Walmart and Safeway, and get a meal. There's even a little sightseeing to be had there, if you are creative.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora borealis2, Churchill, MB.JPG|thumb|260px|Northern lights shimmering and dancing above in November]]\\n\\nA good tip for you train boozers\\u2014if you order liquor and a mixer, the mixer is free, so if you bring some of your own mixers... free cokes! The little bottles of wine are decent too. During bear and beluga seasons there is a chef on the train preparing decent, if slightly pricey (free for those in sleeper) fresh meals. Outside of peak season the microwave meals served range from acceptable to disgusting. Most people on board plan ahead and bring food. Cheese, sausage, cracker, fruit, etc. platters are great. A dome car for passengers in sleeper class is usually attached during bear, beluga, and northern lights seasons.\\n\\n=== By car ===\\n\\nThere is no road to Churchill; however, you can drive to Thompson and pay to park your car there (try the Days Inn lot), and continue by train or airplane. The road to Thompson is lonely and subject to closure if a snowstorm hits, though.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n{{mapframe|layer=W}}\\nIt's quite easy to walk within the city limits on your own. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from one end of town to the other. It's also possible to rent a car in Churchill, and there are several taxi drivers who tend to hang out around the airport and train station.\\n\\nCar rental isn't at all popular with tourists, even the ones who aren't on package tours, but taking out an SUV is actually a great idea. If you think there's a good chance of seeing the aurora on a given night, rent a vehicle and drive it out of town at night! You'll be away from the lights of the town, and you'll have a mobile heating device/bear escape pod to keep you safe. If you have a day's worth of downtime from your various activities, you can just drive around the passable roads and go bird-watching, find the downed plane, head down through the woods to the observation tower, up to Cape Merry, or create your own wildlife photo tour. Expect the rental to run around $100 and the gas refill before returning to run around... $100 more.\\n\\n==See==\\n\\nBeyond the wildlife and landscapes, there is actually a fair amount of interesting stuff to see there. The historic [[Hudson's Bay Company]] settlements are perhaps the most interesting, but are impossible to visit during the winter months (and York Factory is hard to reach even when it's possible). Aside from Cape Merry, that is, which along with the Itsanitaq Museum is an easy and highly recommended sight to see. If you have a car and a free day, head south of the city to the observation tower and east of the city to see Miss Piggy up close.\\n[[File:Churchill Inukshuk en route to the port.JPG|thumb|260px|An ''inukshuk'' with the Port of Churchill behind, en route to Cape Merry]]\\n* {{see\\n| name=Cape Merry | alt= | url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/mb/prince/activ/merry | email=\\n| address= | lat=58.78871 | long=-94.19984 | directions=The northern tip of Churchill, past the port\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=Q22426630\\n| content=An old cannon battery was set up in 1747 to protect the Hudson Bay Company's business on the Churchill River, rather stupidly, as the cannons there could be captured by an enemy and used to fire upon Prince of Wales Fort across the river.

But it needs a caveat: you will spend very little time actually on a sled, and dog sledding involves little more than standing or sitting down and letting the dogs do the work. The true art of dog sledding is principally breeding and taking care of the dogs and secondarily logistics for trips. Also, during high season, expect to spend a lot of the time waiting around for your turn, as only two people can ride at a time!\\n\\n[[File:Churchill dog sledding2.JPG|thumb|260px|A late afternoon jaunt with some happy Canadian sled dogs]]\\n\\nSo why do the dog sledding activity at all?

They will simply use a wheeled sled.\\n\\nAs with the buggies, there are two operations in town, run by the two co-founders of the Hudson Bay Quest, a 220-mile (330-km) race from [[Gillam]] to Churchill every March (it used to go up along the west coast of the Hudson Bay to [[Arviat]], [[Nunavut]], but the boreal forest makes for a less whiteout sort of run than the flat, snow-covered tundra).\\n\\n* {{do\\n| name=Blue Sky Expeditions | alt= | url= | email=jgaazure@mts.net\\n| address=100 Button St | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1 204-675-2001 | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=$95/guest, $147/non-hotel guest\\n| content=Run by the owner of Blue Sky B&B (see [[#Sleep|below]]), Gerald Azure.

The boat tours spend one-two hours on the water and then one more hour on the other bank to explore Prince of Wales Fort. The first is through Lazy Bear Lodge (see [[#Tundra buggies|above]] for contact information), which does a three-hour tour for $130 per person, but cannot be booked in advance unless you have a room with them, so a spot would not be guaranteed if staying elsewhere and setting up your trip independently.

The more standard tour, of course, is the July\\u2013August Beluga and Fort Tour, 2.5-3 hours in a Zodiac, $105 adults/$52.50 kids under 13. Kayak and standup paddleboard tours also run July\\u2013August at $160/person and $170/person respectively for three hours.\\n}}\\n\\n===Snorkelling/diving===\\nYes, snorkelling! Most tourists are not mentally fortified to jump into a cold, cold river filled with whales, but it is certainly the most up-close way to see the Belugas. Scuba diving is permitted, but there are no guides to take you, so only experienced divers, and you must bring your own equipment to Churchill. You can fill your tanks at the hospital. For snorkellers, though, the two boating tour companies above (Sea North and Lazy Bear Lodge) will set you up with a guide and dry suit or wet suit. Sea North snorkelling in wet suits is available July\\u2013August, three hours, $195/person, two person minimum.

Be careful when walking anywhere on the outskirts of town, such as Cape Merry, by the ''inukshuk'' and the big wooden boat behind the town centre, or anywhere outside of town. In such areas close to town you will notice Polar Bear Alert signs \\\"Stop. Don't walk in this area\\\", and if you do see a bear in or near town, call the Bear Patrol immediately at +1 204-675-BEAR (2327).\\n\\nBecause of the dangers posed by polar bears, '''car doors are never locked''' in Churchill (don't ever lock your own if renting), and the quickest way to escape danger, if going indoors is not an immediate option, is to simply hop in a car and shut yourself inside. There hasn't been a bear-related death since 1980, but injuries have happened since, and even locals can get surprised by an itinerant bear now and then\\u2014stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\\n\\n==Stay healthy==\\n\\nBecause of Churchill's size and remote location, the services available at the hospital are limited. Individuals with serious medical issues may be transported to Winnipeg by air ambulance. The provincial government will cover most if not all of the cost of the evacuation for Manitoba residents, but not for other residents of Canada. Those coming from outside of Manitoba may or may not be covered by their provincial health plan or private supplementary plan. Visitors from outside of Canada [[Canada#Stay Healthy|should always purchase health insurance when visiting Canada]] unless they are coming on a visa that allows them to apply for provincial health insurance. As the cost for the flight to Winnipeg can exceed $10,000, plus the cost of a ground ambulance in Winnipeg and medical treatment in both Winnipeg and Churchill, insurance for visitors should have a high coverage ceiling.\\n\\n==Connect==\\nYou will have Wi-Fi wherever you stay, and nearly all hotels will have an available computer. There is LTE cell data service in town, which also extends to the airport, though don't expect it anywhere else outside of town. Anyone with a Canadian SIM card or whose international carrier has a roaming agreement with any of the three major Canadian cell providers (Bell, Rogers or Telus) should be able to get service.\\n===By mail===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Canada Post | url=http://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/fpo/personal/findPostOfficeDetail?outletId=0000510920 | email=\\n| address=204 La V\\u00e9rendrye Ave | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1 204-675-2696 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=M-F 8AM-5PM | price=\\n| content=Handy for shipping souvenirs.\\n}}\\n\\n==Go next==\\n[[File:Churchill Wildlife Management Area polar bear5.JPG|thumb|260px|Don't let the door hit you on the way out, sucka!]]\\n\\nThere really isn't anywhere to go\\u2014you're stranded here!

As of Jan 2022, the park is on UNESCO's mixed tentative list along with the proposed Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area for its exceptional representation of the Arctic ecosystem.\\n[[File:Sirmilik Glacier 2 1997-08-06.jpg|right|thumb|Sirmilik Glacier]]\\n\\nThe park is seldom visited \\u2013 in 2022\\u201323, it only received a mere 6 visitors.\\n==Understand==\\nSirmilik National Park, nearest the town of Pond Inlet, covers an area of 22,200 km\\u00b2 (8,600 sq mi), which is larger than El Salvador.\\n[[File:Byam Martin Mountains 4 1997-08-05.jpg|right|thumb|Byam Martin Mountains]]\\n\\nSituated within the Arctic Cordillera, the park is composed of three areas: most of Bylot Island with the exception for a few areas that are Inuit-owned lands, Oliver Sound, and Baffin Island's Borden Peninsula. Much of the park is bordered by water.\\n\\nGeographically, it is representative of the Northern Eastern Arctic Lowlands Natural Region and parts of the Lancaster Sound Marine Region.\\n\\nIn the Inuktitut (or Inuit language), Sirmilik means \\\"place of glaciers\\\". As Canadian Arctic Inuktitut-speakers referred to northern Baffin Island as Sirmilik, the name of the geographic region became the name of the national park.\\n\\n===History===\\n\\nExtensive archaeological exploration of the park area has indicated that the area has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years. The earliest known are predecessors of the modern-day Inuit.\\n\\nThe area was explored by European whalers and by explorers in their search for the Northwest Passage. In the 1610s, the area was surveyed by British explorers William Baffin and Robert Bylot. They named several features of the area including Lancaster Sound and Bylot Island in 1616. It was 200 years before the next official attempt to find the Passage through this area. The expedition by the British explorer John Ross in 1818 confirmed the accuracy of Baffin's charts, but ended when he saw what he believed were mountains blocking the end of Lancaster Sound. The area was later thoroughly explored during an extensive aerial mapping program of Northern Canada by the Canadian Government which took from the 1930s until the late 1950s to complete.\\n\\nThe Byam Martin Mountains on Bylot Island were climbed by Pat Biard and then Ben Farris in 1954, including Mount Thule. In 1963 British explorer Bill Tilman traversed the island, but did not climb any of the larger peaks. In 1977, a Canadian expedition of Rob Kelly and others climbed 20 peaks of Bylot Island, and in 1984 Mike Schmidt with others climbed 28 peaks, including 16 first ascents.\\n\\nThe park was established as a bird sanctuary in 1965 and monitored by the Canadian Wildlife Service because of its seabird colonies. The area became a national park in 2001. Today, the area is inhabited by the Inuit who continue to hunt and fish as their ancestors did.\\n\\n===Landscape===\\n\\n[[File:Sirmilik National Park geography.jpg|thumb|right|300px|NASA image of the park with the three areas labelled]]\\n\\nThe park consists of three land and marine components. These are Oliver Sound, to the south of Pond Inlet, characterised by a long narrow fjord flanked by towering cliffs and glaciers, the plateau and river valleys of the Borden Peninsula and Baillarge Bay, and finally Bylot Island, characterised by its rough terrain with mountains, coastal lowlands, icefields and glaciers. Hoodoos are unique eroded formations on Bylot Island and the Borden Peninsula. Evidence shows that the area was scoured by the Laurentide ice sheet, a massive sheet of ice that covered hundreds of thousands of square kilometers at least 20,000 years ago.\\n\\nThe Borden Peninsula extends north for 225 km (140 mi) and is 64 km (40 mi) \\u2013 169 km (105 mi) wide. The northern area, including the Hartz Mountains, are composed of flat, dissected rock rising to over 914 m (2,999 ft) above sea level. Admiralty Inlet forms a western border, with Elwin Inlet also to the west, while Navy Board Inlet forms a border to the east, separating the peninsula from Bylot Island. Navy Board Inlet's coastal cliffs rise to 457 m (1,499 ft).\\n\\nBylot Island lies off the northern end of Baffin Island and has an area of 11,067 km\\u00b2 (4,273 sq mi). It is also one of the largest uninhabited islands in the world. While there are no permanent settlements, Inuit from Pond Inlet and elsewhere regularly travel to Bylot Island. An Inuit seasonal hunting camp is southwest of Cape Graham Moore. \\n\\nThe Byam Martin Mountains extend from east to west across Bylot Island and are an extension of the Baffin Mountains which in turn form part of the Arctic Cordillera mountain system. The highest mountain in the range is Angilaaq Mountain, 1,951 m (6,401 ft), near the island's centre. The Byam Martin Mountains are made up of Archean-Aphebian igneous crystalline rock and Proterozoic metasedimentary and metamorphic rock, such as gneiss. Sharp peaks and ridges, divided by deep glacier-filled valleys are typical features in the range and has been extensively modified by glacial erosion. Extensive glaciers dot the island including the Kaparoqtalik Glacier. Vertical cliffs along the coastline are made up of Precambrian dolomite. The island's north shore faces Lancaster Sound, a polar bear maternity den area, also noted for its high concentrations of marine wildlife. To the northeast of the park is Baffin Bay and to the south lies Pond Inlet and Eclipse Sound.\\n\\n===Fauna===\\nBeluga whales, seals, walruses, Peary caribou, Arctic foxes, Arctic hares and wolves are found in this park. Bylot Island is a migratory area for narwhals. Sirmilik is one of eight Canadian national parks that contains polar bears.\\n\\nA major seabird colony is located in the area of Baillarge Bay. Seabird colonies are also on Bylot Island which have a large colony and nesting area of greater snow geese. More than 70 species of birds have been recorded here, of which about 40 are known to breed. The park is known to be an important bird sanctuary. In 1965, Bylot Island enclosed within the park was also declared as a \\\"Migratory Bird Sanctuary\\\" in view of the large number of migratory birds in the area. A record 100,000 birds are reported to pass the park during summer months every year, and the large geese population of the island is known to constitute the most abundant herbivores of the island. On some of Bylot Island's rugged cliffs within the park, thousands of nesting birds can be found including 300,000 thick-billed murre and 80,000 black-legged kittiwake.\\n\\n===Flora===\\n\\nThe wetlands of the park (10% of the area) have abundant vegetation of water sedge (Carex aquatilis), white cottongrass (Eriophorum scheuchzeri) and tall cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium). Other types of grass include the Fisher\\u2019s tundragrass (Dupontia fisheri), the polar grass (Arctagrostis latifolia) and semaphore grass (Pleuropogon sabinei). In addition, several species of brown moss have been recorded. In the Arctic environment of the southern part of the island 360 species of plants have been documented, which are considered to have rare quality and productivity.\\n\\nVegetation in the upland (on hill slopes and terraces) which constitute 90% of southern drier areas of the park consist of forbs, such as Arctic heather (Cassiope tetragona), mountain avens (Dryas integrifolia), Arctic poppy (Papaver radicatum) and mountain sorrel (Oxyria digyna), grasses, such as polar grass (Arctagrostis latifolia), northern foxtail (Alopecurus alpinus), bluegrass (Poa arctica) and northern wood rush (Luzula confusa) and shrubs, such as Arctic willow (Salix arctica) and northern bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum).\\n\\n===Climate===\\n[[File:Kaparoqtalik Glacier 1 1997-08-06.jpg|right|thumb|Kaparoqtalik Glacier]]\\nIn the north of Baffin Island, there is a polar maritime climate which means long, cold winters and short, cool summers. The spring does not end until mid-June and the warmest period is late July and early August, with average maximum temperatures of 10 \\u00b0C. The coldest month is January as the average maximum temperatures of about \\u221230 \\u00b0C. Rainfall is relatively abundant, contributing to the flora seen in the park.\\n\\nThere is almost endless daylight from May to August, but the sun is absent from the sky December and January. Spring brings strong winds and late summer is often cloudy. In winter, loss of daylight and the presence of sea ice can make for extremely cold weather. Weather in the Arctic is notoriously changeable. Abrupt weather changes can affect sea and boating conditions forcing boaters to wait out rough waters, sometimes for several days. Be prepared for snow anytime, anywhere in Sirmilik.

Most hikes on Bylot Island will take you to ancient glaciers. \\n\\n===Sea kayaking===\\nThe waters of Oliver Sound can be used for sea kayaking with a local guide or on your own.  Equipment rentals may be available in Pond Inlet.\\n\\n===Wildlife viewing===\\nBylot Island is a Migratory Bird Sanctuary managed jointly with the Canadian Wildlife Service. The island is a haven for seabirds, migratory waterfowl, \\nand other wildlife and has the largest colony of greater snow geese in the world. \\n\\nThe Baillarge Bay sea bird cliffs, near Arctic Bay, are home to thousands of thick-billed murres and black-legged kittiwakes best seen by expedition style cruise ships. \\n\\n===Skiing, mountaineering and glacier travel===\\nSpring (late March to early June) is the ideal time for ski touring and mountaineering here, especially on Bylot Island. \\n\\n===Floe edge tours===\\nThe most popular wildlife viewing is guided, spring floe edge tours where visitors may see narwhal, beluga whales, polar bear and many species of birds. \\n\\n===Boating===\\nIn the summer (late July to early September) Sirmilik is accessible only by water. The nearest community to Bylot Island is Pond Inlet, 25 km to the south, across Eclipse Sound. Local boat operators and guides are available in Pond Inlet or Arctic Bay to provide marine transportation to the park.\\n\\nTour operators must be licensed by Parks Canada to provide guiding and outfitting services inside Sirmilik National Park.  Contact the Parks Canada office in Pond Inlet at {{phone|+1 867 899-8092}} for a list of operators.\\n\\nTravelling by sea kayak is one way to experience Sirmilik for those who are very experienced and only in certain areas. Marine hazards include strong winds, adverse weather, floating ice, and tides. Boat transportation to drop-off and pick-up points is advised.\\n\\n===Marine points of interest===\\n\\n*'''Oliver Sound - Kangiqluruluk''': south of Pond Inlet, Oliver Sound features an immense scenic fiord with excellent opportunities for boating, sea kayaking, and camping. Its steep cliffs and valley glaciers provide some of Sirmilik's most impressive scenery, and its sheltered waters are ice-free relatively early in the summer season. Several large alpine glaciers come close to the sound, and are ideal places to explore. There are several good camping areas along the shore, and many opportunities for day hikes into the adjacent uplands.\\n*'''Lancaster Sound - Tallurutiup imanga''': This very large body of water between Devon Island and Sirmilik is one of the most productive marine areas in the entire Canadian arctic. It is home to abundant populations of seabirds, walrus, polar bear, and several species of seal and whale. It is also the eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage and an important route for marine transportation.\\n*'''Eclipse Sound - Tasiuja''': The main marine transportation route to Bylot Island, Navy Board Inlet and Borden Peninsula. It is often covered by pack ice until mid-summer, and travel can be dangerous due to strong winds, currents, and high waves. There is abundant marine life in the sound, including narwhals and polar bears. Spectacular icebergs add to the local scenery. Some become grounded in shallow waters, remaining in Eclipse Sound for several years before floating into Baffin Bay.\\n*'''Navy Board Inlet - Nalluata imanga''': The main access corridor to the park's Borden Peninsula, Cape Hay and Lancaster Sound. The scenery is impressive, and several glaciers descend abruptly to the shoreline just north of Low Point.\\n\\n==Buy, eat and drink==\\nThere are no facilities in the park. Bring everything you will need.\\n\\nFilter (<0.5 microns), treat (iodine or chlorine in warm water), or \\nboil your drinking water. \\n\\n==Sleep==\\n\\nThere is no lodging in the park. \\n\\nIf you are camping, practise [[leave-no-trace camping]].\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n===When to go===\\n*Late March to early June (spring): The best time of year for winter activities. Frozen oceans make it possible to travel from either Pond Inlet or Arctic Bay to the park boundary by snowmobile or dog team to start your trip.\\n*Late June to mid-July (break up): During ice break up, travel to the park is impossible. You can explore the areas around Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay.\\n*Late July to late September (summer): This is the best time for hiking and camping. Boat travel to the park is possible.\\n*October to early November (freeze up): This is the best time for hiking and camping. Boat travel to the park is possible. \\n*November to February (winter): Travel to Sirmilik National Park is not advisable at this time. Cold temperatures, near-constant darkness & access difficulties in early winter make winter travel unpleasant, dangerous and, often, impossible.\\n\\n===Hazards===\\n*'''Polar bears''' Polar bears are most active along the coast of\\nthe Borden Peninsula and along the north, west, and east coasts of Bylot Island. Be particularly cautious in March/April when females with cubs are emerging from their dens and July to October when the sea ice is gone and bears are forced ashore. For more information, speak with parks staff, read the Safety in Polar Bear Country pamphlet, and watch the \\u201cPolar Bears: A Guide to Safety\\u201d at the park office or request one [http://www.distributionaccess.com online]{{Dead link|date=March 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}.\\n*'''Foxes and wolves''' can carry rabies. Do not allow them to approach you. \\n*'''Birds and wildlife''' are inquisitive and opportunistic. They will scavenge food left out and raid caches that are not securely stashed. Make sure food and garbage is securely stored.\\n*'''Walrus or whales''' can be aggressive and easily upset a boat. Keep your distance.\\n*'''Frostbite, hypothermia, and thin ice''' are hazards of winter travel in the Arctic.\\n\\n==Go next==\\n\\n{{IsPartOf|Nunavut}}\\n{{usablepark}}\\n{{geo|72.9906|-81.1373|zoom=7}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Torngat Mountains National Park Banner.jpg}}\\n\\n'''Torngat Mountains National Park''' is a [[Canadian national parks|Canadian national park]] on the Labrador Peninsula in [[Nunatsiavut]], occupies the northernmost tip of [[Labrador]], [[Canada]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[Image:Nachvak Fjord Labrador 2008.JPG|thumb|Nachvak Fjord]]\\nThe Torngat Mountains are named for the Inuktitut word ''torngait'', meaning \\\"place of spirits\\\".

Mt Caubvick/D\\u2019Iberville is the tallest at 1652 m (5437 feet); a few other peaks reach above 1538 m (5000 ft).\\n\\nThere are hundreds of [[archaeological sites]] in the park, some dating back almost 7,000 years. More recent remains include Moravian Mission sites, as well as Hudson Bay Company trading posts in Saglek and Nachvak fjords.\\n\\nAs the park is remote and remains in its natural state, it is well suited to wildlife watching - including birds, caribou and bears.\\n\\n==Do==\\nWilderness-oriented recreational activities include hiking, scrambling, kayaking and day or multi-day cultural and natural excursions, often with Inuit guides.\\n\\n===Hiking===\\nThere are no roads, trails, or signs in Torngat Mountains National Park. There are, however, unmarked hiking routes and traditional Inuit travel routes marked by inuksuit (stone markers). Visitors can explore the park on guided or unguided day hikes and interpretive walks, overnight camping trips, multiday backpacking treks, and technical rock-climbing excursions.\\n\\nWith help and logistical support from Torngat Mountains Base Camp and Research Station, Parks Canada offers a range of day trips and overnight hiking opportunities in Torngat Mountains National Park.\\n\\nThere are many opportunities for backpacking in the vast and diverse terrain of Torngat Mountains National Park. Visitors can explore established hiking routes or map out their own route through different areas.\\n\\nParks Canada has prepared multi-day and shorter single-day hiking route descriptions for visitors. These outline known routes and offer some interpretation of the area. These route descriptions are reliable for describing the area that you are hiking in, but you must carry your own map, compass, and GPS. Do not use the route description as your only means of navigation.\\n\\nParks Canada also sets up satellite camps each summer to provide support for visitors that are looking for an overnight hiking experience. These satellite camps are big enough to hold 5-6 pup tents enclosed by a temporary bear fence. Visitors can do day hikes to and from these camps to areas of interest, ideally in the company of an Inuit bear guard.\\n\\nFor more information about hiking in the park, and the level of skill required for different routes, contact Torngat Mountains National Park or Torngats Base Camp and Research Station.\\n\\n==Buy==\\nThis is Arctic wilderness; there are no amenities within the park.

This is the Arctic, polar bear country where distances are vast (the park covers twice the area of [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada's smallest province) and assistance is not always close at hand. Unless one is experienced with this region, it's best to rely on an Inuit guide when venturing far beyond the base camp. Native guides are permitted to carry firearms (where visitors are not) and know the area well.\\n\\nBring warm clothing and extra provisions, as adverse (unpredictable and bitterly cold) weather, sometimes even in summer, may substantially delay your transport out of the park. Under adverse conditions, outside assistance may be days away even in an emergency.\\n\\nCarry bear repellent and keep food out of reach of [[dangerous animals]]. Polar bears, black bears, foxes and wolves are all present in the area.\\n\\nLeave a copy of your plans with friends or family, so that they may contact police in an emergency (Nain's RCMP detachment is {{phone|+1 709 922-2862}}; Parks Canada is {{phone|+1 709 922-1290}} in Nain and operates 24-hour emergency dispatch from faraway [[Jasper]], [[Alberta]] at {{phone|+1 780-852-3100}} or {{phone|+1-877-852-3100}}).\\n\\n==Connect==\\nA [[Mobile telephones|satellite phone]] may be the only means of limited (and expensive) communication in this remote location.

Access to the park is limited due to its remote location and an effort to preserve the park. The name comes from the Cree word for polar bear (w\\u00e2pask). The park is also home to Cape Churchill, which is renowned as the best location in the world to view and photograph wild polar bears. The only way people can access Cape Churchill is by helicopter or Tundra Buggy.\\n\\nWapusk National Park covers {{km2|11,475}} park &mdash; bigger than Jamaica &mdash; and protects one of the world's largest known polar bear maternity denning areas.

The park is in the range of the Western Hudson Bay population of polar bears, which has remained stable at about 1000 bears.\\n\\nSea ice is the natural habitat of polar bears, and it's where they hunt  the ring seal, their major food source. In fall, from late September to November, many of the bears migrate along the coast to catch the first pack ice of the winter. The number of bears peaks in the areas around Cape Churchill in the park, and along the coast between the park and the town of Churchill.\\n\\nWhen the ice of the Hudson Bay melts in late July, the bears come ashore. While on shore, they gather along the coast and fast for about four months, until they can hunt seals again when the bay freezes. Pregnant females remain on land through the winter to give birth to their cubs and will fast for about eight months.\\n\\nThe active polar bear season is usually mid-summer to late fall.\\n\\nThis national park is also home to great grey owls, timber wolves, lemmings, ivory gulls, arctic foxes, peregrine falcons, snowshoe hares, red foxes, moose, wolverines, Caspian terns, and a herd of 3 000 Cape Churchill caribou.\\n\\nNumerous birds are found in the Wapusk National Park and it is a likely breeding area of the short-billed dowitcher.\\n\\n===Climate===\\nSnowstorms can happen at any time of year.\\n\\nMay: temperatures range from {{celsius|-10}} to {{celsius|20}}.\\n\\nJune, July and August: temperatures range from {{celsius|-10}} to {{celsius|35}}, and are highly variable: they may plunge 20 degrees in less than an hour.\\n\\nSeptember and October: temperatures range from {{celsius|25}} to {{celsius|15}}, and the weather is often stormy.\\n\\nDecember and January: average temperature is {{celsius|26}}, but it can drop as low as {{celsius|-50}}, and wind chills may push make it feel as cold as {{celsius|-65}}.\\n\\n===Visitor information===\\n* [https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/mb/wapusk Park website]\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Parks Canada Visitor Centre | alt= | url=http://pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/mb/wapusk/activ/centre | email=wapusk.np@pc.gc.ca\\n| address=1 Mantayo Seepee Meskanow, [[Churchill]] | lat=58.767813 | long=-94.174393 | directions=\\n| phone=+1 204-675-8863 | tollfree= +1-888-773-8888\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia= | wikidata=\\n| lastedit=\\n| content=Wapusk\\u2019s main entry point, Churchill, is the site of Parks Canada\\u2019s Visitor Centre.\\n}}\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[File:Wapusk 2 1996-08-12.jpg|right|thumb| Cape Churchill in summertime]]\\n[[Churchill]] is 1,400 km (870 miles) northeast of Winnipeg, accessible by plane or Via Rail train.

Schematically, those to the west of Paris ([[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], [[Saint Cloud (France)|Saint Cloud]], [[Levallois]], [[Versailles]], Poissy, Rueil-Malmaison) are wealthy residential communities, even if some more middle class suburbs can be found. Those to the north are poorer communities, and very ethnically diverse. Those to the south are a mix of rough and poor neighbourhoods alongside very affluent communities. Finally, those to the east are usually lower-middle class mingled with a few upper-middle class communities.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nParis sits on the River Seine, in north-central France. Around 2.2&nbsp;million people live in the city of Paris, but this only represents the urban core within the ''Boulevard P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique''. There are some 10 million in the wider ''M\\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris'' (814 km<sup>2</sup>) and almost 13&nbsp;million people living in the metropolitan area, making this one of Europe's largest.\\n\\nDue to high expectations, a tight schedule, language barriers and large crowds and long lines at certain attractions during high season, the city might disappoint some visitors. Foreign visitors who have an idealized view of Paris might be shocked by the typical challenges of visiting any large city; crime, traffic noise, pollution, garbage, and relatively high costs. In the worst case, visitors might experience the ''Paris syndrome''; a psychological state of delusion.\\n\\nTo enjoy the wonders of Paris, make realistic plans. The amounts of attractions and landmarks is overwhelming; visiting only the most famous ones (which can be overcrowded during major holidays) takes more than a week. The city also has more to offer for people who take time for a calm stroll along the backstreets. If your time in the city is short, be selective, and save some attractions for your next visit.\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Paris je t'aime | alt= | url=https://parisjetaime.com/eng/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2024-01-30\\n| content=The website of the tourist office.\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=SPOT24 | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=101 quai Jacques Chirac, Paris 15th | lat= | long= | directions=Metro: Bir-Hakeim (line 6); RER: Champ-de-Mars\\u2014Tour Eiffel (line C); V\\u00e9lib': station 7023\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=Daily 10:00-18:00 | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2024-01-30\\n| content=The City of Paris welcome centre also has an exhibition and shop.\\n}}\\n\\n===History===\\nParis started life as the Celto-Roman settlement of ''Lutetia'' on the \\u00cele de la Cit\\u00e9, the island in the Seine now occupied by the ''Cath\\u00e9drale de Notre Dame''. It takes its present name from the name of the dominant [[Celts|Gallo-Celtic tribe]] in the region, the ''Parisii''. At least that's what [[Roman Empire|the Romans]] called them, when they showed up in 52 BCE and established their city ''Lutetia'' on the left bank of the Seine, in what is now called the \\\"Latin Quarter\\\" in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe Romans held out here for as long as anywhere else in the Western Empire, but by 508 CE they were gone, replaced by '''Clovis of the [[Franks]]''', who is considered by the French to have been their first king. Clovis' descendants, aka the Carolingians, held onto the expanded Lutetian state for nearly 500 years through Viking raids and other calamities, which finally resulted in a forced move by most of the population back to the islands which had been the centre of the original Celtic village. The Capetian Duke of Paris was voted to succeed the last of the Carolingians as [[Kingdom of France|King of France]], ensuring the city a premier position in the medieval world. Over the next several centuries Paris expanded onto the right bank into what was and is still called ''le Marais'' (The Marsh). Quite a few buildings from this time can be seen in the [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe medieval period also witnessed the founding of the Sorbonne. As the \\\"University of Paris\\\", it became one of the most important centres for learning in Europe\\u2014if not the whole world, for several hundred years. Most of the institutions that still constitute the University are found in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]], and [[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th arrondissements]].\\n\\nIn the late 18th century, there was a period of political and social upheaval in France and Europe, during which the French governmental structure, previously a monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy, underwent radical change to forms based on Enlightenment principles of nationalism, citizenship, and inalienable rights. Notable events during and following the revolution were the storming of the Bastille (in what is now the [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissement]]), and the rise and fall of Napoleonic France. Out of the violent turmoil that was the French Revolution, sparked by the still known ''Passion des Fran\\u00e7ais'', emerged the enlightened modern day France.\\n\\nThe Paris of today was built long after the Capetian and later the Bourbon Kings of France made their mark on Paris with the ''Louvre'' and the ''Palais Royal'', both in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]. In the 19th century, Baron von Hausmann set about reconstructing the city, by adding the long straight avenues and replacing many of the then existing medieval houses, with grander and more uniform buildings.\\n[[File:Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|210px|The Eiffel Tower]]\\n\\nNew wonders arrived during ''La Belle \\u00c9poque'', as the Parisian golden age of the late 19th century is known. Gustave Eiffel's famous tower, the first metro lines, most of the parks, and the streetlights (which are partly believed to have given the city its epithet \\\"the city of light\\\") all come from this period. Another source of the epithet comes from ''Ville Lumi\\u00e8re'', a reference not only to the revolutionary electrical lighting system implemented in the streets of Paris, but also to the prominence and aura of ''Enlightenment'' the city gained in that era.\\n\\nThe twentieth century was hard on Paris, but thankfully not as hard as it could have been. Both world wars took a heavy toll on the city's inhabitants, but at least Hitler's order to burn the city was ignored by the German General von Choltitz, who was quite possibly convinced by a Swedish diplomat that it would be better to surrender and be remembered as the saviour of Paris, rather than its destroyer. Following the war, the city recovered quickly at first, but slowed in the 1970s and 1980s when Paris began to experience some of the problems faced by big cities everywhere: pollution, housing shortages, and occasionally failed experiments in urban renewal.\\n\\nHowever, post-war Paris enjoyed considerable growth as a multi-cultural city, with new immigrants from all corners of the world, especially ''La Francophonie'', including most of [[North Africa|northern]] and [[West Africa|western Africa]] as well as [[Indochina]]. These immigrants brought their foods and music, both of which are of prime interest for many travellers. Immigration and multi-culturalism continues in the 21st century with a marked increase in the arrival of people from Latin America, especially [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], and [[Brazil]]. In the late 1990s, it was hard to find good Mexican food in Paris, whereas today there are dozens of possibilities from lowly ''taquerias'' in the outer ''arrondissements'' to nice sit-down restaurants on the boulevards. \\n\\nNevertheless, Paris remains a French city; bistros, baguettes, high-end fashion, art, accordions, Hausmann architecture, and all the stereotypes (whether good or bad) of France are alive and well in Paris. People from all over France flock to Paris for work, study, partying, and everything in between. After all, this IS the capital of France, so anything pertaining to France can be found here.\\n\\nThe 21st century has also seen vast improvements in the general livability of Paris, with the mayor's office concentrating on reducing pollution and improving facilities for soft forms of transportation including a huge network of cycle paths, larger pedestrian districts and new metro lines. Visitors who normally arrive car-less are the beneficiaries of these policies as much as the Parisians themselves, although tensions and doubts have emerged over the actual benefits of those measures.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Metric\\n| janhigh =   7\\n| febhigh =   9\\n| marhigh =   12\\n| aprhigh =   16\\n| mayhigh =   20\\n| junhigh =   23\\n| julhigh =   25\\n| aughigh =   25\\n| sephigh =   22\\n| octhigh =   16\\n| novhigh =   11\\n| dechigh =   7\\n| janlow =   3\\n| feblow =   3\\n| marlow =   5\\n| aprlow =   8\\n| maylow =   11\\n| junlow =   14\\n| jullow =   16\\n| auglow =   17\\n| seplow =   14\\n| octlow =   9\\n| novlow =   6\\n| declow =   4\\n| janprecip = 54\\n| febprecip = 44\\n| marprecip = 49\\n| aprprecip = 53\\n| mayprecip = 65\\n| junprecip = 55\\n| julprecip = 63\\n| augprecip = 43\\n| sepprecip = 55\\n| octprecip = 60\\n| novprecip = 52\\n| decprecip = 59\\n}}\\n\\nParis has an oceanic climate with moderately cold winters and warm summers.

There are also a few local lines of high interest to tourists which are privately owned. All SNCF, Eurostar and Thalys tickets can be bought in railway stations, city offices and travel agencies (no surcharge). SNCF relies on travel agencies for selling tickets online, the main one being [https://www.sncf-connect.com/ SNCF Connect] and [https://www.thetrainline.com Trainline] (easier to use). You can also find tickets in online and physical travel agencies. You can book and buy tickets up to three months in advance. There are significant discounts if you book weeks ahead. Reduced ticket prices are different for each day and each train and can be used only on the train the reservation is for. Trains between Paris and south Germany (Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich) as well as the Marseille-Frankfurt TGV are jointly operated by SNCF and Deutsche Bahn, but each of the two operators will sell tickets at its own price! Make sure to check the price offered by each operator before you buy, or use Trainline since they automatically compare SNCF and DB prices.\\n\\n{{see also|Rail travel in Europe}}\\n\\nThere are a number of different kinds of high-speed and normal trains:\\n\\n* '''TER''': The regional trains (''Train Express R\\u00e9gional''); cheapest tickets, though prices are variable on the time of day of departure (and the day of departure as well). TER are sometimes slower, stopping at almost all stations. TER tickets bought at the train station are valid two months from the date indicated on the ticket, as long as you travel in the right fare period (\\\"p\\u00e9riode bleue\\\", the cheapest, \\\"p\\u00e9riode blanche\\\", for high-demand hours). There is no seat reservation, so arrive early enough or you may have to travel without a seat.\\n* '''Intercit\\u00e9s''': A bundling of the former ''Intercit\\u00e9s'', ''T\\u00e9oz'', and ''Lun\\u00e9a'' train categories. There are two kinds: the regular trains, which are priced the same as the TER and the trains you'll find yourself on if you have a [[Eurail]] or [[InterRail]] pass and don't want to pay extra for reservations, and the ''trains \\u00e0 r\\u00e9servation obligatoire'', which require a reservation and are priced differently from the regular ''Intercit\\u00e9s'' trains.\\n* '''Intercit\\u00e9s de nuit''': Overnight trains from destinations to and from south of France, including [[Latour-de-Carol]], [[Lourdes]] and [[Cerb\\u00e8re]] via [[Toulouse]].\\n* '''TGV''': The world-famous French high-speed trains (''Trains \\u00e0 Grande Vitesse'') run very frequently to the southeast [[Nice]] (5-6 hr), Marseille (3 hr) and [[Avignon]] (2.5 hr), the east [[Geneva]] (3hr) or [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], [[Dijon]] (1 hr 15 min) and [[Strasbourg]] (1 hr 45 min), the southwest [[Bordeaux]] (3 hr), the west [[Rennes]] (2 hr) and the north [[Lille]] (1 hr). Thalys to Brussels (1 hr 20 min) use almost identical trains. Reservations are obligatory.\\n* '''ICE''': German [[high-speed train]]s, operating most services between Paris and [[Frankfurt]].\\n* '''Thalys''': A high-speed train service running daily to/from the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]. Though it can be a bit expensive compared to normal trains, tickets can be cheap enough if you buy in advance. On-board service is usually very good.\\n* '''Eurostar''': The Eurostar service connects Paris with [[London]] St. Pancras directly and [[Brussels]] indirectly, as well as many other destinations indirectly through the various west European rail services. Travel time between Paris Gare du Nord and [[London]] St Pancras International averages 2hr 15 min. Eurail and InterRail passes are ''not'' valid for this train, though pass holders can benefit from a reduced price. You must arrive at the station at least 90 minutes, and up to two hours, before the departure of the train to complete security and passport controls.\\n* '''[http://www.ouigo.com/ Ouigo]''': A subsidiary of SNCF running TGVs with a second class only layout intended and marketed as a lower-cost service. Strict baggage limits and 30-minute check in times make them more like budget airlines.\\n* '''Trenitalia''': Operates high-speed '''Frecciarossa''' trains between Paris, Lyon, Chamb\\u00e9ry, Modane, Turin, and Milan. Prices can be cheaper than SNCF, Trainline automatically compares both options.\\n\\n=====From Gare d'Austerlitz=====\\n* Gare d'Austerlitz \\u2013 Gare de Bercy (15 min): Bus 24 to \\u00c9cole V\\u00e9t\\u00e9rinaire de Maisons-Alfort.\\n* Gare d'Austerlitz \\u2013 Gare de l'Est (20 min): {{rint|paris|5}}, direction Bobigny.\\n* Gare d'Austerlitz \\u2013 Gare Montparnasse (25 min): {{rint|paris|10}} direction Boulogne, change at Od\\u00e9on for {{rint|paris|4}} direction Mairie de Montrouge.

Not surprisingly, traffic jams are significantly worse during French school holidays.\\n\\nThe multi-lane highway around Paris, called the ''P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'' (BP), is probably preferable to driving through the center. Another beltway nearing completion; ''L'A86'' (also {{European road|FR|A|186}} and A286) loops around Paris about 10&nbsp;km further out from the ''P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique''. A third, incomplete beltway is much further out and called ''La Francilienne'' (N104).\\n\\nIt is advised not to drive within Paris and to be wary in the metropolitan area. It is better to drive to a suburban train station with a parking lot and then use the train to continue your trip throughout Paris. Most of Paris' roads were created long before the invention of automobiles. Traffic inside the city tends to be heavy, especially at rush hour; driving, however, may be rather easy and efficient in the evening. Parking is also difficult. Furthermore, the medieval nature of parts of the city's street system makes it very confusing, and traffic will almost never allow one to stop or slow down to get one's bearings. If you are unfamiliar with the streets and still insist on driving in the city, make sure you have a navigator in the passenger seat with you. However, Paris does have several iconic boulevards that have multiple lanes, form the backbone of the city\\u2019s road network, and are useful if you do choose to bring a car \\u2014 and are tourist attractions onto themselves.\\n\\nIn Paris, there are many car rental agencies offering a large number and wide range of vehicles for rental. Additionally, there are numerous car rental agencies located off-site which provide free airport transfers from their location and may offer lower prices well.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\n=== By public transport ===\\n[[File:Navigo Easy.jpg|thumb|\\n\\nNavigo Easy Travel Card\\n\\n]]Paris has an excellent public transport system that spans every inch of the city. It is well-known for its ''M\\u00e9tro'' (short for ''Chemin de fer m\\u00e9tropolitain'', \\\"Metropolitan Railway\\\"), ''RER'' (short for ''R\\u00e9seau Express R\\u00e9gional'', \\\"Regional Express Network,\\\"), and ''Transilien'' rail networks. The M\\u00e9tro, RER and  Transilien are complemented by a large network of trams and buses.\\n\\n[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en \\u00cele-de-France Mobilit\\u00e9s] is the authority that controls and coordinates the different transport companies operating in the \\u00cele-de-France region, including Paris. The website and app can be used to plan journeys, track services, and purchase tickets.\\n\\n[https://www.ratp.fr/en RATP] operates the M\\u00e9tro, trams, buses, and about half of the RER A and B. [https://www.transilien.com/en SNCF] operates the rest of the RER, as well as the Transilien. Both companies take the same tickets, so the difference is of little interest for most people except in case of strikes. For example, RATP may strike without SNCF doing so or the other way around.\\n\\nThe M\\u00e9tro and RER move staggering numbers of people into, out of, and around Paris (6.75 million people per day on average), and most of the time in reasonable comfort. However, certain lines are operating at or near capacity, sometimes being so full that you'll have to let one or two trains pass before being able to board. If you can help it, avoid M\\u00e9tro lines 1, 4, and 13 and RER line A and B during rush hours as these are the most congested lines in the system.\\n\\nStrikes, breakdown and construction are regular occurrences on the Paris public transit system. Generally during a strike, the M\\u00e9tro operates with reduced service and some RER lines may stop operating altogether. Visit the [https://www.ratp.fr/en RATP] or [https://www.transilien.com/en SNCF] websites for information on which routes are affected. Beware that real-time traffic information and construction announcements are often available only on the French-language version.\\n\\n==== By M\\u00e9tro ====\\n[[File:Carte M\\u00e9tro de Paris.svg|thumb|250x250px|M\\u00e9tro Map]]\\nLook for the M\\u00e9tro stations, marked with a large \\\"M\\\" sign or with an old-styled sign saying \\\"M\\u00e9tropolitain\\\".\\n\\nThere are 16 M\\u00e9tro lines (''lignes'') (''1''-''14'', ''3bis'', and ''7bis'') on which trains travel all day at intervals of a few minutes. Trains usually come 2\\u20133 minutes apart during rush hour and 5\\u201310 minutes apart during other times, depending on the line. The service starts on each end of every line at 05:30, and the last metro arrives on each end at 01:15 (service ends an hour later on Friday and Saturday nights, and the day before a holiday), stopping at all stations on the line. Some lines have rare trains that terminate at an intermediate station; if that happens, get off the train with the rest of the crowd and board the next train on the same track or on the other side of the platform (the driver will usually make an announcement in French). Lines 7 and 13 have a fork, so if you take line 13 north of ''La Fourche'' or line 7 south of ''Maison Blanche'', make sure to board the train for the correct destination which is indicated by a lit arrow on the sign in the middle of the platform and on colour-coded binders in each carriage. Times for trains can be seen on an electronic scroll board above the platform. Scheduled times for first and last trains are posted in each station on the centre sign. Generally, except for early and late hours, travellers should not worry about specific Metro train times; just get to your station and take the next train.\\n\\nThe lines are named according to the names of their terminal stations (the end of the line). If you ask the locals about directions, they will answer something like: take line number ''n'' towards \\\"end station _\\\", change at \\\"station _\\\", take the line ''nn'' towards \\\"end station _\\\" etc. The lines are also colour-coded.\\n\\nChanging metro lines might be difficult at times for visitors travelling to or from the airport or train stations with heavy luggage or those with impaired mobility, especially at major metro intersections. Moving from one platform to another generally involves walking up and down multiple flights of stairs. Very few stations have elevators (only the newest line 14 is wheelchair-accessible at all stations). Only the busiest ones have escalators. It might be a good idea to check out the bus routes and timings and see if one can find a convenient bus connection.\\n\\nEach station displays a detailed map of the surrounding area with a street list and the location of buildings (monuments, schools, places of worship, etc.,) as well as exits for that particular metro. Maps are located on the platform if the station has several exits or near the exit if there is only one exit.\\n\\nExcept for M\\u00e9tro 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, and 14, the doors will not open automatically. In such a case, there are handles or buttons located both inside and outside the train that you have to push or unlatch in order to open the door. Many locals may try to squeeze into the trains after the alarm has sounded to signal the closing of the doors. While one can occasionally pass through on lines with a driver, the automatic doors on M\\u00e9tro 1 and 14 will continue to close despite the presence of a limb or article of clothing. It is strongly advised to wait for the second train than to chance being caught between the doors.\\n\\nSome larger stations have secondary entrances, where there is no ticket booth. These are labelled ''voyageurs munis de billets'' (passengers with tickets).\\n\\n==== By RER ====\\n[[File:RER A - Gare Noisiel.JPG|thumb|Information on service OKRE, last stop Torcy]]There are five commuter train lines that cross Paris: RER A, B, C, D, and E. RER trains run at intervals varying from about 3 minutes (RER A) to 6 minutes (RER D), and stop at every station '''within''' Paris. Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend.\\n\\nRER trains will stop at every station within Paris (zone 1), but may skip stations outside Paris, so if you're going to the suburbs make sure your RER stops where you need! Information about the stops to be made by the next incoming train is presented on a separate board also hanging from the ceiling.\\n\\nRER trains do not have publicly announced numbers unlike the rest of SNCF network; the four letter codes (COHI, ELAO, QYAN, VICK, etc.) take the role of the train numbers instead; the first letter indicates the station where the train terminates, and the other three indicate the route and stops. Each line has its own nomenclature. You can look up what these codes mean on information panels in the station, but the easiest and fastest way is often to check the information screens along the platforms.\\n\\n==== By Transilien ====\\nThe rest of the regional train network, called \\\"Transilien\\\", departs from the main train stations (Lyon for line R, Est for line P, Nord for lines H and K, St-Lazare for lines J and L, Montparnasse for line N) and La D\\u00e9fense (line U). Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend. The Transilien is marginally less crowded than the RER and the Metro.\\n\\n==== By tram ====\\nMost tourists will not encounter the trams as they run only on the outskirts of the city. Trams T3a & T3b go nearly three quarters of the way round the city at the edge. Tram line 7 connects Orly Airport with RER line C; it is cheap but not fast.\\n\\n==== By bus ====\\nA bus ride is interesting if you want to see more of the city. All stops have a name and are clearly marked on the street. At complex intersections, stops usually have a map that lets you know where other lines stop and if applicable where to find a M\\u00e9tro entrance. If more than one line stops, wave to the driver to let them know you want to board. All buses have a schematic map of the line on display with all stop names, bus connections and major street names. Electronic displays inside each bus tell riders its current position and what stops remain, but don't overly rely on them as they don't always work.\\n\\nSince the M\\u00e9tro is primarily structured around a hub-and-spoke model, there are some journeys for which it can be quite inefficient. In these cases it is worth seeing if a direct bus route exists, despite the complexity of the bus network.\\n\\n''Noctilien'' night buses run regularly through the central hub at Chatelet to outlying areas of greater Paris. There is also a circle line connecting the main train stations. It pays to know one's Noctilien route ahead of time in case one misses the last M\\u00e9tro home. Women travellers should probably avoid taking the Noctilien on their own to destinations outside Paris.\\n\\n==== Fares ====\\n\\nA Navigo Travel Card is required to use public transport in Paris city and the wider \\u00cele-de-France region. The card can be loaded with a variety of fares (e.g. 10 M\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Tickets). It cannot be loaded with credit like other cards around the world (e.g. \\u20ac50). The card needs to be validated at the start of a journey and when transferring to a new tram or bus. It does not need to be validated at the end of a journey unless required to exit a fare gate.\\n\\nThe following cards are available to obtain:\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\"\\n|+Navigo Travel Cards\\n!Navigo in English\\n!Navigo in French\\n!Price\\n!Locations to obtain/load\\n!Fares available to load\\n|-\\n|[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/smartphone '''Navigo on Smartphone''']\\n|''Navigo sur Smartphone''\\n|Free\\n|\\n\\u00cele-de-France Mobilit\\u00e9s app,<br>\\nBonjour RATP app,<br>\\nSNCF Connect app,<br>\\nApple Wallet app,<br>\\nSamsung Wallet app\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Ticket,<br>\\nBus-Tram Ticket,<br>\\nAirports Ticket,<br>\\nRoissyBus Ticket,<br>\\nDay Ticket,<br>\\nWeek Ticket,<br>\\nMonth Ticket,<br>\\nParis Visite Ticket\\n|-\\n|[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/navigo-easy-travel-card '''Navigo Easy Travel Card''']\\n|''Passe Navigo Easy''\\n|\\u20ac2\\n|\\nTicket Windows,<br>\\nTicket Machines\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Ticket,<br>\\nBus-Tram Ticket,<br>\\nAirports Ticket,<br>\\nRoissyBus Ticket,<br>\\nDay Ticket,<br>\\nParis Visite Ticket\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/navigo-decouverte-travel-card Navigo D\\u00e9couverte Travel Card]'''\\n|''Passe Navigo D\\u00e9couverte''\\n|\\u20ac5\\n|\\nTicket Windows,<br>\\nTicket Machines\\n|\\nDay Ticket,<br>\\nWeek Ticket,<br>\\nMonth Ticket\\n|}\\nThe following fares are available to load:\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\"\\n|+Fares in Paris and \\u00cele-de-France\\n!Fare in English\\n!Fare in French\\n!Price\\n!Validity\\n!Rules\\n|-\\n|[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/metro-train-rer-ticket '''M\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Ticket''']\\n|''Billet M\\u00e9tro-Train-RER''\\n|\\u20ac2.50\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular\\n|\\nValid for 120 minutes,<br>\\nNot valid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nIncludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/bus-tram-ticket Bus-Tram Ticket]'''\\n|''Billet Bus-Tram''\\n|\\u20ac2\\n|\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable\\n|\\nValid for 90 minutes,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nIncludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/paris-region-airports-ticket Airports Ticket]'''\\n|''Billet A\\u00e9roports''\\n|\\u20ac13\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nOrlyval\\n|\\nValid for 120 minutes,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nIncludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/orlybus-and-roissybus-tickets RoissyBus Ticket]'''\\n|''Billet RoissyBus''\\n|\\u20ac13\\n|\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid for 90 minutes,<br>\\nValid to/from Charles de Gaulle airport,<br>\\nExcludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-day-ticket Day Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Jour''\\n|\\u20ac12\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable\\n|\\nValid any day,<br>\\nNot valid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable up to 6 days in advance\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-weekly-ticket Week Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Semaine''\\n|\\u20ac31.60\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable,<br>\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid from Monday to Sunday,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable from Friday to Thursday\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-monthly-ticket Month Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Mois''\\n|\\u20ac88.80\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable,<br>\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid from 1st to 31st,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable from 20th to 19th\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/paris-visite-ticket Paris Visite Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Paris Visite''\\n|\\u20ac29.90\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable,<br>\\nOrlyval,<br>\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid any day,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable in advance\\n|}\\nPaper tickets were completely discontinued in 2025.\\n\\nTicket inspectors roam the network and show no mercy to tourists pleading ignorance. Travelling without a ticket will result in you being cited and forced to pay a fine on the spot. Inspections usually take place behind the turnstiles at major metro stations or during transfers.\\n===By boat===\\n[[File:Bateaux Mouches Paris 2011.jpg|thumb|A bateau mouche near the Pont Neuf]]\\nThere are several excellent boat services which make use of the Seine. As well as providing easy, cheap transport to much of central Paris, excellent photo opportunities abound. You can buy a day or 3 day ticket and hop on and off the boat as needed. The boats take a circular route from the Eiffel Tower, down past the Louvre, Notre Dame, botanical gardens then back up the other bank past Mus\\u00e9e d'Orsay.  [http://www.batobus.com/ Batobus] offers a regular shuttle service between the main tourist sights (closed Jan); other companies such as the famous [http://www.bateaux-mouches.fr Bateaux Mouches] offer sightseeing cruises.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\n\\n{{Infobox|To stop a taxi|If the sign is green, the cab is available, if it is red, the cab is busy, if it is off, the cab is off}}\\n\\nTaxis are comparatively cheap especially at night when there are no traffic jams to be expected. There are not as many as one would expect, and sometimes finding a taxi can be challenging. In the daytime, it is not always a good idea to take a taxi, as walking or taking the metro (''See: M\\u00e9tro'') will often be faster. If you know you will need one to get to the airport, or to a meeting, it is wise to book ahead by phone.\\n\\nThe initial fare is \\u20ac2.40 and the meter increases by around \\u20ac1.10 each kilometer and around 50 cents each minute spent at red lights or in traffic jams. Fares are fixed by the city law and every driver complies with them. Fares vary according to the day of the week, the hour of the day and the area you're crossing. If you call a taxi, the meter starts when you call and not when you get in. You should expect a \\u20ac5 to \\u20ac10 fare on the meter when the taxi arrives after you call it.\\n\\n'''Remember''' if a taxi is near a 'taxi station', they're not supposed to pick you up ''except'' at the station where there may be people waiting for a taxi. Taxi stations are usually near train stations, big hotels, hospitals, and large crossings.\\n\\nThere are a number of services by which you can call for taxis or make a reservation in advance. The two largest fleet are Taxis G7 and Taxis Bleus:\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis G7 | url=http://www.taxisg7.fr | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 47 39 47 39 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis Bleus | url=http://www.taxis-bleus.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 891 70 10 10 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\nAs in many other cities a taxi can be difficult to stop; you may have to try several times. When you do get a taxi to stop, the driver will usually roll down his window to ask you where you want to go. If the driver can't (or doesn't want to) go where you want, he might tell you that he's near the end of his work day & can't possibly get you where you want before he has to go off-duty.\\n\\nThere is a \\u20ac6.40 minimum (2012) on all taxi rides, mandated by city law, but the meter does not show this amount, which can result in being asked to pay more than the metered amount on short rides. In Paris taxis are required by law to charge for the trip with a meter, charging a flat rate is illegal, except from/to Charles de Gaulle airport (\\u20ac50 from the right bank of the Seine, \\u20ac55 from the left bank) and Orly airport (\\u20ac35 from the right bank, \\u20ac30 from the left bank). Frequently the taxi driver will not want to drive you all the way to the doorstep, but will prefer to let you out a block or so away if there are one or more one-way streets to contend with. Try to look at this as a cost-savings rather than an inconvenience. You should pay while still seated in the cab as in New York and ''not'' through the front window London style. A tip is included in the fare price; If you're especially satisfied with the service, you can give something (basically 10%), but you don't ''have'' to. There is an extra charge for baggage handling.\\n\\nThe driver will not let you sit in the front seat (unless there are 3 or 4 of you, which is a rare case usually expedited by more money). Taxi-drivers come in all types, some nice, some rude, some wanting to chat, some not. Smoking in taxis is generally not allowed, however it might be that the taxi driver himself wants a cigarette in which case the rule might become flexible. Many drivers prefer that you avoid using your cellphone during the ride; if you ''do have'' to, make an apologizing gesture & sound, and do make a '''short''' call.\\n\\nIf for any reason you wish to file a complaint about a Paris taxi, take note of the taxi's number on the sticker on the left hand backseat window. Beware of illegal taxis (see the 'Stay Safe' section).\\n\\n===By car===\\n\\nIn a word: '''don't'''. It is generally a very bad idea to rent a car to visit Paris. Traffic is very dense during the day, and parking is, on average, exceedingly difficult and expensive. This is especially true in areas surrounding points of interest, since many of these are in areas designed long before automobiles existed. A majority of Parisian households do not own cars, and many people who move to the city find themselves selling their cars within a month or two.\\n\\nThat said, driving may be an option for going to some sights in the suburbs such as Vaux-le-Vicomte castle or the castle and city at [[Fontainebleau]], or for starting to other places in France. You may prefer to rent from a location outside Paris proper.\\n\\nTraffic rules in Paris are basically the same as elsewhere in France, with the exception of having to yield to incoming traffic on roundabouts. However, driving in dense traffic in Paris and suburbs during commute times, can be especially strenuous. Be prepared for traffic jams, cars changing lanes at short notice, and so on. Another issue is pedestrians, who tend to fearlessly jaywalk more in Paris than in other French cities. Be prepared for pedestrians crossing the street on red, and expect similar adventurous behaviour from cyclists. Remember that even if a pedestrian or cyclist crossed on red, if you hit him, you (in fact, your insurance) will have to bear civil responsibility for the damages, and possibly prosecution for failing to control your vehicle. Note that the speed limit in Paris is 30 km/h in almost every street, besides a few large avenues clearly marked as such. There are no stop signs in the city center.\\n\\nParis has several orbital roads. There is a series of boulevards named after Napoleonic-era generals (''Boulevard Mass\\u00e9na'', ''Boulevard Ney'', and so forth), and collectively referred to as ''boulevards des Mar\\u00e9chaux''. These are normal wide avenues, with traffic lights. Somewhat outside of these is the ''boulevard p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'', a controlled-access road with grade separation. The ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique int\\u00e9rieur'' is the inner lanes (going clockwise), the ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique ext\\u00e9rieur'' the outer lanes (going anti-clockwise). Despite the looks, the ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'' is not an ''autoroute'': the speed limit is 70 km/h and, very unusually, incoming traffic has the right of way, at least theoretically (presumably because, otherwise, nobody would be able to enter during rush hour).\\n\\n=== By chauffeur ===\\nKnown as car services or livery cabs, these cars are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares. You need to book them before they can pick you up. They are flat rate rather than metered (''ask for the fare before getting in''), and there are two types of licence: the \\\"Grande Remise\\\" that allows the car & driver to pick-up & drop-off passengers anywhere in France, and the \\\"carte verte\\\" that allows pick-up & drop-off in the department or region where the company is based. The Grande Remise cars have a GR on their front plate. They provide more service than a normal cab.\\n* Shared shuttle: You have to share the shuttle with other customers. They can be delayed since the shuttle needs to pick up other customers and perhaps drop them off before you, but they are cheaper than a private shuttle.\\n* Private shuttle: Will pick you up on-time and drop you off directly to the address specified in the booking.\\n\\n=== By motorcycle ===\\nParis is an incredibly open city, with its many \\\"Grands Boulevards\\\" and monuments with large open spaces around make it a city perfect to be explored and viewed by scooter or motorbike. Be warned that scooter/motorbike is by far the mode of transportation with the most casualties in Paris: half of victims of a collision were riding one, although they only account for about 2% of the traffic. When you're riding a scooter or motorbike in Paris, even if you see others doing so, it is not allowed to \\\"lane-split\\\" between the rows of cars waiting in traffic. At the red lights, even though a lot of scooter and motorbike drivers do not respect it, don't forget to pay attention to the bike designated area: you are not allowed to use them, and doing so is equivalent to failing to respect the red light (\\u20ac135 fine). Parking-wise there are plenty of ''deux roues'' (two wheel) parking spots all over the city. Again, even though you may see plenty of scooters or motorbikes parked on the sidewalk, it is forbidden to do so. The city of Paris has dramatically increased the number of vehicles fined every day (\\u20ac35), some of them even being towed away (at your own expenses).\\n\\n*{{do\\n| name=Paris By Scooter | url=http://parisbyscooter.com/ | email=paris@parisbyscooter.com\\n| address=(Scooter always delivered to your hotel) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 6 28 35 39 30 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=08:00-21:00 | price=From \\u20ac60\\n| content=All Vespa scooter rentals and Paris guided City tours include the collect and picked up from, your hotel in Paris.\\n}}\\n*{{listing\\n| name=Left Bank Scooters | url=http://www.leftbankscooters.com | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=Scooter delivered to your hotel\\n| phone=+33 6 78 12 04 24 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=08:00-20:00 | price=From \\u20ac60\\n| content=Scooter rental that is delivered to, and picked up from, your hotel in Paris.

A simple \\\"''Bonjour Monsieur / Madame, parlez-vous anglais?''\\\" should suffice.}}\\n\\nRenting a bike is a very good alternative over driving or using public transport and an excellent way to see the sights. Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than almost any town or city in the United States. The French are very cognizant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. Paris hasn't always been the easiest place to get around by bike, but that is no longer the case. The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well, in establishing some separated bike lanes, creating a bikesharing system, and allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riverside paths which are perfect for cycling. The Paris bike network now counts over 150&nbsp;km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist. In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-hours of the day when traffic is lighter. Do remember to bring a good map, since there is no grid plan to speak of and almost all of the smaller streets are one-way.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Paris Walking 101|To get a great orientation of the city on foot while seeing many of Paris' major sights, you can do a West to East walk along the [[Axe Historique]] from the Arc de Triomphe to \\u00cele de la Cit\\u00e9 (Notre Dame). This walk takes about 1-2 hours without any stops. Start at the top of the Champs Elys\\u00e9es (at the Arc de Triomphe) and begin walking down the Champs Elys\\u00e9es towards Place ('square') de la Concorde.\\n*On the way towards the obelisk on the square, you'll see the major stores and restaurants of Paris' most famous avenue.\\n*Once you've passed the main shopping area, you'll see the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais to your right.\\n*At Place de la Concorde, you'll be able to see many of Paris' major monuments around you.

Cross Pont Neuf and walk through the Latin Quarter, cross the river again to reach Notre Dame cathedral on Ile de la Cit\\u00e9.}}\\n\\nWhile the streets of Paris are generally fairly easy on novice cyclists, there are some streets in the city that should be avoided by those who do not have sufficient urban cycling experience. Rue de Rivoli, Place de la Bastille, and Place de la Nation are particularly hairy, especially during weekdays and the Saturday evening rush, and should not be navigated by anyone not confident in their ability to cycle in heavy traffic. Avenue des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, Place de l'\\u00c9toile, and voie Georges Pompidou (the lower-level express lanes along the banks of the Seine) should be avoided at all times.\\n\\nParis has a bike share system known as{{listing\\n| name=V\\u00e9lib' | alt= | url=https://www.velib-metropole.fr/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 76 49 12 34 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\u20ac5 per day, first half hour free\\n|wikidata=|image=| lastedit=2019-02-10\\n| content=In January 2018, the original V\\u00e9lib' was replaced by a new system called V\\u00e9lib' M\\u00e9tropole, that encompasses an ever larger area than the previous one. At first there were some technical issues, but by the end of 2018 it seems like they were mostly resolved. Bikes include a screen showing eg. how long a bike has been rented. Some electric bikes are also available (for an extra fee).\\n}} You can purchase the V\\u00e9lib pass online. An app helps finding stations and available parking slots. Green V\\u00e9lib bikes are normal bikes, blue V\\u00e9libs are ebikes.\\n\\n===By foot===\\n\\nWalking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous caf\\u00e9s and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the ''Metro'' may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.\\n\\nThe smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you'll be able to see more of the city. That said, pay attention to the M\\u00e9tro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the M\\u00e9tro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by walking along a major boulevard until you find a M\\u00e9tro station.\\n\\nYou may have heard of the hazard of walking into dog droppings in Paris. The problem is now virtually nonexistent due to fines as high as \\u20ac180 and extensive street cleaning operations.\\n\\nIt's always fun to experience the city by foot, and there are numerous walking tours around Paris, whether self-guided (with the help of a guidebook or online guide) or with a touring guide (booked through your travel agency or hotel). The city is best explored by foot, and some of the most marvelous memories you will have of Paris is walking through secret found places.\\n\\nPedestrian call buttons at crosswalks are activated by pressing the button underneath the call button box.\\n\\n==Talk==\\n\\n[[French]] (''fran\\u00e7ais'') is of course the country's official language. Any native French person will speak French and it helps if you can speak a bit of it. In the parts of the city that tourists frequent the most, the shopkeepers, information booth attendants, and other workers are likely to answer you in English, even if your French is advanced. These workers tend to deal with thousands of foreign-speaking tourists, and responding in English is often faster than repeating themselves in French. This is not the case for the rest of the city.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Reading up|Before you leave you may want to read a book like ''French or Foe'' by Polly Platt or ''Almost French'' by Sarah Turnbull \\u2014 interesting, well-written records from English-speaking people who live in France.}}\\n\\nFor most Parisians, English is something they had to study in school, and thus seems a bit of a chore. People helping you out in English are making an extra effort, sometimes a considerable one. Parisians younger than 40 are much more likely to be fluent in English. Immigrants, often working in service jobs, are less likely to speak English. If it's your first time in France you will have some problems understanding what people are saying, even with prior education in French. Unlike most language education tapes, real Parisians tend to speak fast, use slang, and swallow some letters.\\n\\nWhen attempting to speak French, do not be offended if people ask you to repeat, or seem not to understand you, as they are not acting out of snobbery. Keep your sense of humour, and if necessary, write down phrases or place names. And remember to speak slowly and clearly. Unless you have an advanced level and can at least sort of understand French movies, you should also assume that it will be difficult for people to understand what you are saying (imagine someone speaking English to you in an indiscernible accent).\\n\\nWhen in need of directions what you should do is this: find a younger person, or a person reading some book or magazine in English, who is obviously not in a hurry; say \\\"hello\\\" or \\\"''bonjour''\\\" (bon-zhor); start by asking if the person speaks English, \\\"Parlez-vous anglais?\\\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay?) even if the person can read something in English, speak slowly and clearly; write down place names if necessary. Smile a lot. Also, carry a map (preferably ''Paris par Arrondissement''); given the complexity of Paris streets it is difficult to explain how to find any particular address in any language, no matter how well you speak it. If anything, the person may have an idea as to the place you are looking for, but may not know exactly where it may be, so the map always helps.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you will probably get the cold shoulder if you stop a random person in the m\\u00e9tro, fail to greet them and say \\\"where is place X or street Y\\\".\\n\\nNow, if you speak French, remember two '''magic phrases''': \\\"Excusez-moi de vous d\\u00e9ranger\\\" [ex-kuh-zay mwuh duh voo day-rawn-ZHAY] (\\\"Sorry to bother you\\\") and \\\"Pourriez-vous m'aider?\\\" [por-EE-AY voo may-DAY] (\\\"Could you help me?\\\") especially in shops; politeness will work wonders.\\n\\nIt is considered polite to always say \\\"bonjour\\\" (during the day) or \\\"bonsoir\\\" (at night) to employees when entering any type of shop even if you have no intention of buying anything. Upon leaving you should say \\\"merci\\\" to thank the shopkeeper for allowing you to browse and say \\\"bonne journ\\u00e9e\\\" (bun zhur-nay) or \\\"bonne soir\\u00e9e\\\" (bun swa-ray) to wish them a good day or evening. \\\"Bonne nuit\\\" is only used when telling someone \\\"goodnight\\\" when going to bed.\\n\\nFinally, if you speak a language other than English or French, and your French is limited or non-existent, offer to speak your second language with the phrase \\\"Parlez-vous anglais ou XXXX?\\\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay oo XXXX?) as this shows that you are making an effort to speak somebody else's language as well as your own.\\n\\n[[File:Pont des Arts, Paris.jpg|thumb|750px|center|The Pont des Arts (Bridge of the Arts) and just behind, the pont Neuf (\\\"New Bridge\\\", but actually the oldest in Paris) and the \\u00eele de la Cit\\u00e9.]]\\n\\n==See==\\n{{Mapframe|48.86473|2.33362|width=600|zoom=12||show=mask,see,do}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q50716}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q216125}}\\n\\nThe listings below are just some '''highlights''' of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Paris.

These include: The Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle, and the catacombs<!-- and the steps to climb to the top of the Notre Dame Cathedral-->. To avoid lines, you should start your day by arriving at one of these sites at least 30 minutes before opening time. Otherwise, expect a wait of at least an hour. Most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday. Examples: the Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while the Orsay Museum is closed on Mondays. Be sure to check museum closing dates to avoid disappointment! Also, most ticket counters close 30-45 min before final closing.\\n\\nAll national museums are open free of charge on the first Sunday of the month. However, this may mean long lines and crowded exhibits. Keep away from Paris during Easter week due to crowding. People have to queue up at the Eiffel Tower for several hours even early in the morning. However, this wait can be greatly reduced, if fit, by walking the first two levels, then buying an elevator ticket to the top. Entry to the permanent exhibitions at city-run museums is free at all times (admission is charged for temporary exhibitions).\\n\\n===Sightseeing passes===\\nOne of the best value and most convenient ways to see the sights of Paris is with the [http://www.parismuseumpass.com/en/home.php ''Paris Museum Pass'']{{Dead link|date=March 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}, a pre-paid entry card that allows entry into over 70 museums and monuments around Paris (and the Palace of Versailles) and comes in 2-day (\\u20ac62), 4-day (\\u20ac77) and 6-day (\\u20ac92) denominations (August 2024). These are ''consecutive'' days. The card allows you to jump lengthy queues, a big plus during tourist season when lines can be extensive, and is available from participating museums, tourist offices, FNAC branches and all the main M\\u00e9tro and RER train stations. You will still need to pay to enter most special exhibitions. To avoid waiting in the first long queue to purchase the museum pass, stop to purchase your pass a day or more in advance after mid-day. The pass does not become active until your first museum or site visit when you write your start date. After that, the days covered are consecutive. Do not write your start date until you are certain you will use the pass that day and be careful to use the European date style as indicated on the card: day-month-year.\\n\\nAlso consider the [http://www.parispass.com/ ''ParisPass''], a pre-paid entry card + queue jumping to 60 attractions including the Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, as well as a river cruise which allows free metro & public transport travel.\\n\\n==Do==\\n===Sports===\\n* {{do\\n| name=[[Paris/16th arrondissement#Q43605|French Open]] | alt=Roland Garros | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=48.84716 | long=2.24924 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| image=Roland Garros Stadium in 2007.jpg\\n| content=One of the 4 Tennis Grand Slam tournaments.

There is no user-friendly online version of these guides.\\n\\n===Photography===\\n\\nParis is considered by many as the birthplace of photography, and while one may debate the correctness of this claim, there is no debate that Paris is today a photographer's dream. The French capital offers a spectacular array of photographic expositions and opportunities to the beginner and the pro alike. It has photogenic monuments (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, the obelisk at Concorde, and countless others); architecture (e.g., the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Museum of the Arab World) and urban street scenes (e.g., in the Marais, Montmartre and Belleville). When you tire of taking your own photos, visit one of the many institutions dedicated to photography. At these and other institutions, you can learn the about the rich history of Paris as the place of important developments in photography (e.g., the Daguerrotype) and as the home of many of the trade's great artists (e.g., Robert Doisneau, Andr\\u00e9 Kert\\u00e9sz, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson).\\n\\n* {{listing | type=do\\n| name=Maison Europ\\u00e9ene de la Photographie | alt=La MEP | url=https://www.mep-fr.org/english/ | email=\\n| address=5/7 Rue de Fourcy | lat=48.8551395| long=2.3567364| directions=Metro Saint-Paul, Pont Marie\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=W-Su 11:00-20:00 | price=Admission \\u20ac9\\n| wikipedia=/Maison_europ\\u00e9enne_de_la_photographie\\n| lastedit=2019-09-29\\n| content=Important center for contemporary photography with a large exposition area having three or four major expositions per year dedicated to contemporary photography.

Of course, like anywhere else you can see big budget first-run films from France and elsewhere. That though, is just the start. During any given week there are at least half-a-dozen film festivals going on, at which you can see the entire works of a given actor or director. Meanwhile, there are some older cult films like say, ''What's new Pussycat'' or ''Casino Royal'' which you can enjoy pretty much any day you wish.\\n\\nMany non-French movies are subtitled (called \\\"''version originale''\\\" \\\"VO\\\" or \\\"VOstfr\\\" as opposed to \\\"VF\\\" for version fran\\u00e7aise).\\n\\nThere are any number of ways to find out what's playing, but the most commonly used guide is ''Pariscope'', which you can find at newsstands for \\u20ac0.70.

Buttes-Chaumont is great for those with children that like to run, climb, and explore. Built on the site of an abandoned quarry, the park is roughly bowl-shaped with a 30-meter-tall peak situated in the middle of a pond at the park's center. There are trails up the rock, caves, waterfalls, a suspension bridge, and a small stone gazebo on the top of the rock with a 360-degree view. There is also a puppet theater and a playground.

Unless you possess one of a number of in-demand skills, it will almost certainly be necessary to obtain a job offer from an employer before arriving. Your employer, for their part, will have to have the offer approved by the relevant governmental authorities, as well. If you opt for unreported work, such as babysitting, you need not fret about going through the process to obtain a ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'', i.e., a formal visitor's identity card. However, if you do choose a change in location, it is advisable to obtain a ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'' prior to finding any job whatsoever, as the process can be longer than expected. A ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'' is often necessary to open a bank account and the like, and by extension for accomplishing any number of other tasks involved in modern life, so unless you're very comfortable transacting everything in cash you should probably bite the bullet and keep things on the up-and-up.\\n\\nIf you go to Paris for a conference, there's a very good chance you'll end up in a meeting or exhibiting at CNIT (Centre of New Industries and Technology). This conference and convention space is one of the oldest buildings in the La Defense area of Paris and still looks modern even though it's been eclipsed in height by surrounding buildings and hotels near the CNIT are mainly catered to those staying in the area on business.\\n\\nRemember, the city of Paris has a huge network of immigrants coming and going, and it is always great to tap into that network. The city holds a great abundance of work ready to be found, even if the search feels nerve-wracking at first.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n\\nParis is one of the great '''fashion''' centres of the Western world, up there with [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], and [[Milan]], making it a shopper's delight. While the Paris fashion scene is constantly evolving, the major shopping centres tend to be the same. High end couture can be found in the 8th arrondissement. In summer, there is nothing better than browsing the boutiques along Canal St-Martin, or strolling along the impressive arcades of the historic Palais-Royal, with beautifully wrapped purchases swinging on each arm.\\n\\n'''Le Marais''' is a mostly Jewish neighbourhood, most of the shops in Le Marais are open on Sundays. The stores in this area are intimate, boutique, \\\"Parisian\\\" style clothing stores. You will no doubt find something along each street, and it is always well worth the look.\\n\\nOther great areas to shop around in are around the area '''S\\u00e8vres Babylone''' (M\\u00e9tro Line 10 and Line 12). It is in this area you will find the Le Bon March\\u00e9 [[Paris/7th arrondissement|7th]], particularly ''rue de Cherche Midi'' [[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]. The area boasts some of the major fashion houses (Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, etc.) and also has smaller private boutiques with handmade clothing.\\n\\nIn the '''Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pr\\u00e9s''', you can find a handful of vintage clothing shops, carrying anything from couture early 20th century dresses, to 70s Chanel sunglasses. Walking along ''Boulevard Saint-Germain'', you will find major brands. However, if in search of eclectic finds, opt to walk the northern side of the Boulevard, especially along '''rue Saint Andr\\u00e9 des Arts''', where you can always find a nice caf\\u00e9 to stop in. The area south of Saint-Germain is just as nice, and comes with a price tag to match.\\n\\nIn the artsy quarters of 1 and 4, there are many bargains to be had, once again, if you are prepared to look. Souvenirs are easily found and can be fairly inexpensive as long as you don't buy from the tourist sites. For cheap books of French connection, try the University/Latin quarter as they sell books in all languages starting from half a euro each.\\n\\n===Flea markets===\\nParis has 3 main flea markets, all on the outskirts of the central city. The most famous of these is the '''March\\u00e9 aux Puces de St-Ouen (Porte de Clignancourt)''' (Clignancourt Flea Market), ''M\\u00e9tro: Porte de Clignancourt'', in the [[Paris/18th arrondissement#Buy|18th]], a haven for lovers of antiques, second-hand goods, and retro fashion. The best days to go are Saturday and Sunday. There are particular times of the week when only antique collectors are allowed into the stalls, and there are also times of the day when the stall owners take their ''Parisian siesta'', and enjoy a leisurely cappuccino for an hour or so. The best times to visit the flea markets are in the spring and summertime, when the area is more vibrant. In and around the metro station, you may find the area a little wild, but still safe.\\n\\nThe [https://www.salutfromparis.com/vanves-flea-market/ '''March\\u00e9 aux Puce de Vanves'''] in the 14th arrondissement is open on Saturday and Sunday from 7h-14h. The closes metro station is Porte de Vanves.\\n\\n===Musical instruments===\\nRue de Rome, situated near Gare St. Lazare, is crowded with luthiers, brass and woodwind makers, piano sellers, and sheet music stores. Subway station Europe. The area south of the metro station Pigalle is also packed with music shops (more oriented towards guitars and drums).\\n\\n===Artwork===\\nFor art lovers, be sure to check out ''Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pr\\u00e9s'', which is renowned for its galleries, and it is impossible to turn a street without finding a gallery to cast your glance in. On Fridays, most open until late. Most even have the benefit of bottles of wine so you can wander in with your glass of wine and feel very ''artistique''. Great roads to walk along are ''rue de Seine'', ''rue Jacob'', ''rue des Beaux Arts'', ''Rue Bonaparte'', and ''Rue Mazarine''.\\nAlso, be sure to visit the historical district of ''Montparnasse'' and ''quartier Vavin'' where artists like Modigliani, Gauguin and Zadkine used to work.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n\\nParis is one of Europe's culinary centres, where the ''haute cuisine'' has flourished since at least the French revolution. It may however come as a surprise that Paris isn't considered the culinary capital of [[French cuisine]]; many people prefer the French cooking found in small rural restaurants, outside of the city, closer to the farms and with their focus on freshness and regional specialities. Even among French cities, Paris has long been considered by the French as second to [[Lyon]] for fine dining.\\n\\nThere have been other challenges in the last 20 years or so as restaurateurs in places like [[San Francisco]] and [[Sydney]] briefly surpassed their Parisian fore bearers, again with an emphasis on freshness of ingredients but also borrowings from other cuisines. Parisian cooks didn't just rest on their laurels during this time, rather they travelled, taught, and studied, and together with Paris's own immigrant communities, have revitalized the restaurant trade. Today you can find hundreds of beautiful restaurants with thoughtful (or just trendy) interior design and well-planned and executed ''cartes'' and ''menus'' offering a creative ''m\\u00e9lange'' of French and exotic foreign cuisines. It's safe to say that Paris is once again catching up with or edging ahead of its ''Anglophone'' rivals.\\n\\nOf course there are also some traditional offerings, and for the budget conscious there are hundreds of traditional bistros, with their sidewalk ''terraces'' offering a choice of fairly simple (usually meat centred) meals for reasonable prices.\\n\\nIt is unfortunately possible to have a uniformly poor dining experience during a stay in Paris, probably because mass tourism attracts price gougers. It is frequent to hear people complaining of very high Parisian prices for very poor food and service. Since so many of the restaurants are sub-par, the best approach is to rely on a restaurant guide and personal recommendations. Do your research in advance if possible and be prepared to travel some distance. Don't just walk down the street expecting to find good food; you probably won't.\\n\\nMany restaurants are tiny and have tables close together - square metres are at a premium and understandably restaurateurs need to make the most of limited space. In some cases when the restaurant is crowded, you may have to sit beside strangers at the same table. If that does not appeal to you, go to a more upscale place where you will pay for the extra space.\\n\\nTrendy restaurants often require reservations weeks, if not months in advance. If you haven't planned far enough ahead, try to get a reservation for lunch which is generally easier and less expensive.\\n\\nFor an easy-to-manage eating budget while in Paris, consider: breakfast or \\\"petit d\\u00e9jeuner\\\" at a restaurant, possibly in your hotel, consisting of some croissants, coffee, and maybe a piece of fruit. Get a 'walking lunch' from one of Paris' many food stands\\u2014a ''panino'' in the centre of the city, a crepe from a crepe stand, a felafel pita or take-out Chinese in the Marais. ''Traiteurs'' serving Chinese and/or Vietnamese food are ubiquitous in the city and good for a cheap lunch and many ''p\\u00e2tisseries'' sell inexpensive coffee and sandwiches. All these are cheap (about the same as breakfast), easy, and allow you to maximize your sightseeing and walking time while enjoying delicious local or ethnic food. For dinner, stroll the streets at dusk and consider a \\u20ac20-40 prix-fixe menu. This will get you 3 or 4 courses, possibly with wine, and an unhurried, candlelit, magical evening. If you alternate days like this with low-budget, self-guided eating (picnicking, snacking, street food) you will be satisfied without breaking the bank.\\n\\nIf one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch. Virtually all restaurants offer a good prix-fixe deal. By complementing this with a bakery breakfast and a light self-catered dinner, you will be able to experience the best of Parisian food and still stick to a budget.\\n\\n===Self-catering===\\nBudget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the [[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]] or in any other arrondissement). If your accommodation has cooking facilities you're set, especially for wine and cheese, a decent bottle of French wine will set you back all of about \\u20ac3-5, while the ''fairly good'' stuff starts at around \\u20ac7. Bottles for less than \\u20ac3 are not recommended.\\n\\nThe small ''\\u00e9piceries'' which open until late are more expensive than the ''supermarch\\u00e9s'' (Casino, Monoprix, Franprix, etc.) For wine, the price difference can be up to \\u20ac2.\\n\\nBuy a baguette, some cheese and a good bottle of wine and join the Parisian youth for a ''pique-nique'' along the Seine (especially on the \\u00cele Saint-Louis) or along the Canal Saint-Martin. The finest food stores are Lafayette Gourmet in the Galeries Lafayette or La Grande Epicerie in the luxury department store Le Bon March\\u00e9. They are worth discovering. You will find a large variety of wines there, otherwise try wine stores (cavistes) that are present everywhere in the city, and sell all kind of good French wine that you won't find in a supermarket. The owners usually know their wines and will be happy to help you choose among their huge selection. Some also sell good food. You can search for one online or ask a local. There are also some \\\"wine supermarkets\\\" such as Nicolas or Le Relais de Bacchus (all over the city) that sell more common wines.\\n\\n===Some specialities===\\n\\nFor '''seafood''' lovers, Paris is a great place to try ''moules frites'' (steamed mussels and French fries) (better in fall and winter), oysters, sea snails, and other delicacies. '''Meat''' specialties include venison (deer), boar, and other game (especially in the fall and winter hunting season), as well as French favourites such as lamb, veal, beef, and pork.\\n\\n===Prices===\\nEating out in Paris can be expensive. However don't believe people when they say you can't do Paris on the cheap - you can! The key is to stay away from the beaten tracks and the obviously expensive Champs Elys\\u00e9es. Around the lesser visited quarters especially, there are many cheap and yummy restaurants to be found. The area around Fontaine Saint-Michel, the fountain facing Notre Dame is crowded by particularly tasty places to eat, with good ambiance, cheap prices and excellent service, with the advantage of being very centric of many places of interest. The key is to order from the prix-fixe menu, and ''not'' off the A la Carte menu unless you want to pay an arm and a leg. In many places a three course meal can be found for about \\u20ac15. This way you can sample the food cheaply and is usually more \\\"French\\\". Ask for \\\"une carafe d'eau\\\" (oon karaaf doe) to get free tap water.\\n\\n===Kosher dining===\\nParis has the largest number of Kosher restaurants in any European city. Walk up and down Rue des Rosiers to see the variety and choices available from Israeli, Sushi, Italian and others. You will also find a wide assortment of Kosher restaurants in the 9th arrondissement of Paris near the rue Richer and rue Cadet areas. See the district guides for examples. Kosher restaurants and snacks usually display a big orange rectangle on their front, which ensure clients that they are Beth din certified.\\n\\n===Vegetarian dining===\\n<!-- please put individual restaurant listings in the appropriate arrondissement page -->\\n\\nFor '''vegetarians''', eating traditional French food will require some improvisation, as it is heavily meat-based. That being said, it is far easier to be vegetarian in Paris than it is elsewhere in France. Paris has several excellent vegetarian restaurants, and many non-vegetarian restaurants will provide vegetarian dishes. \\n\\nWhen eating in a traditional restaurant, be careful before ordering dishes labelled as \\\"vegetarian\\\". Many French people presume that ''fish'' and ''seafood'' are vegetarian dishes. This is a widely spread misunderstanding all around the country. Additionally, French people tend to confuse \\\"real\\\" vegetarians with vegans. When explaining that you're a vegetarian that won't eat fish, people will often presume that you don't eat milk or egg-based products.\\n\\nLook for spots such as Le Grenier de Notre-Dame in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]'''. The '''[[Paris/10th arrondissement|10th]]''' arrondissement also has quite a large variety of vegetarian restaurants, especially of Indian and East/South-East Asian fare. See the arrondissement pages for more listings. For fast food and snacks, you can always find a vegetarian sandwich or pizza, or indeed French tacos. Even a kebab shop can make you something with just cheese and salad, or perhaps falafel. And for healthier fare, it's not usually hard nowadays to find hipstery places that sell vegan poke bowls.\\n\\nThere are also lots of Italian, Thai, Indian, and Mezo-American places where you will have little problem. The famous South Indian chain Saravana Bhavan have their branch near Gare Du Nord. In Rue des Rosiers (4th arrondissement) you can get delicious falafel in the many Jewish restaurants. Another place to look for falafel is on Rue Oberkampf (11th arrondissement). Take away falafel usually goes for \\u20ac5 or less.\\n\\nMoroccan and Algerian cooking is common in Paris - vegetarian couscous is lovely. Another good option for vegetarians - are traiteurs, particularly around Ledru Rollin (down the road from Bastille) take away food where you can combine a range of different options such as pomme dauphinoise, dolmas, salads, vegetables, nice breads and cheeses and so on.\\n\\nLebanese restaurants and snack shops abound as well, offering a number of vegetarian ''mezze'', or small plates. The stand-bys of course are hummas, falafel, and baba-ganouche (''caviar d'aubergine''). A good place to look for Lebanese is in the pedestrian zone around Les Halles and Beaubourg in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]] and [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]].\\n\\nAlso look out for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) places, especially around Rue Mouffetard in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]''', where you can often get a tofu banh mi for less than a fiver.\\n\\n===Tourists and locals===\\n\\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually geared towards tourists. It does make a difference in the staff's service and behaviour whether they expect you to return or not.\\n\\nSometimes the advertised fixed price tourist menus (\\u20ac10-15) are a good deal. If you're interested in the really good and more authentic stuff (and if you have learned some words of French) try one of the small bistros where the French go during lunch time.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n\\nThe bars scene in Paris really does have something for everyone. From bars which serve drinks in baby bottles, to ultra luxe clubs that require some name dropping, or card (black Amex) showing, and clubs where you can dance like no one's watching, (although they will be). To start your night out right, grab a drink or two in a ubiquitous dive bar, before burning up the dance floor and spreading some cash, at one of the trendy clubs.\\n\\n*'''Canal St Martin'''. Many cozy caf\\u00e9s and other drinking establishments abound around the ''Canal St Martin'' in the '''[[Paris/10th arrondissement|10th]]'''.\\n*'''The Marais'''. The Marais has a large number of trendier new bars mostly in the '''[[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]]''' and to a lesser extent the '''[[Paris/3rd arrondissement|3rd]]''' with a few old charmers tossed into the mix. A number of bars and restaurants in the Marais have a decidedly gay crowd, but are usually perfectly friendly to straights as well. Some seem to be more specifically aimed at up-and-coming hetero singles.\\n*'''Bastille'''. There is a very active nightlife zone just to the northeast of Place de Bastille centered around ''rue de Lappe'', ''rue de la Roquette'', ''rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine'' (especially the amazing Club Barrio Latino) and ''rue de Charonne'' in the '''[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]'''. Many of the bars closest to Bastille have either a North, Central, or South American theme, with a couple of Aussie places mixed in for good measure, and as you continue up ''rue de Charonne'' the caf\\u00e9s have more of a traditionally French but grungy feeling.\\n*'''Quartier Latin - Odeon'''. If you're looking for the ''nouvelle vague'' (new wave) style, student and intellectual atmosphere of Paris in the 1960s and 70s, you'll find a lot of that (and more hip and chic) places in the quartier Latin and between place Odeon and the Seine. The neighbourhood is also home of many small artsy cinemas showing non-mainstream films and classics (check 'Pariscope' or 'l'officiel du spectacle' at any newspaper stand for the weekly programme).\\n*'''Rue Mouffetard and environs'''. The area in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]''' on the south side of the hill topped by the Panth\\u00e9on has a little bit of everything for the nighthawk, from the classy caf\\u00e9s of Place de la Contrescarpe to an Irish-American dive bar just down the way to a hip, nearly hidden jazz caf\\u00e9 at the bottom of the hill.\\n*'''Ch\\u00e2telet'''. In some ways the ''Marais'' starts here in the '''[[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]''' between ''Les Halles'' and ''H\\u00f4tel de Ville'' but with between all of the tourists and the '''venerable Jazz clubs''' on ''rue des Lombards'' the area deserves some special attention.\\n*'''Montmartre'''. You'll find any number of cozy caf\\u00e9s and other drinking establishments all around the ''Butte Montmartre'' in the '''[[Paris/18th arrondissement|18th]]''', especially check out ''rue des Abbesses'' near the ''M\\u00e9tro'' station of the same name.\\n*'''Oberkampf-M\\u00e9nilmontant'''. If you are wondering where to find the hipsters (''bobos'' for bohemian-bourgeois), then this is where to look. There are ''several'' clusters of grungy-hip bars all along ''rue Oberkampf'' in the '''[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]''', and stretching well into the '''[[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]]''' up the hill on ''rue de M\\u00e9nilmontant''. It's almost like being in [[San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco/Haight-Fillmore District|Haight-Fillmore]] district.\\n*'''Bagnolet'''. There are a cluster of bar/restaurant/nightclubs along the southern end of the P\\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in the [[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]] including probably the best place in Paris for nightly local and touring punk rock.\\n*'''Rues des Dames-Batignolles'''. Another good place to find the grungy-chic crowd is the northern end of the '''[[Paris/17th arrondissement|17th]]''' around ''rue des Dames'' and ''rue des Batignolles'', and if you decide you want something a little different Montmartre is just around the corner.\\n*'''Port de Tolbiac'''. This previously deserted stretch of the river Seine in the '''[[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th]]''' was reborn as a center for nightlife (and Sunday-afternoon-life) a few years ago when an electronic music cooperative opened the '''Batofar'''. Nowadays there are a number of boats moored along the same ''quai'', including a boat with a Caribbean theme, and one with an Indian restaurant.\\n*'''Saint Germain des Pr\\u00e9s'''. This area has two of the most famous caf\\u00e9s in the world: Caf\\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots, both catering to the tourists and the snobs who can afford their high prices. This part of the '''[[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]''' is where the Parisian caf\\u00e9 scene really started, and there still are hundreds of places to pull up to a table, order a glass, and discuss Sartre deep into the evening.\\n\\nFor individual bar listings see the various Arrondissement pages under '''Drink'''.\\n\\nOf course there are lots of interesting places which are sort of off on their own outside of these clusters, including a few like the '''Hemingway Bar at the Ritz''' which are not to be missed in a serious roundup of Parisian drinking, so check out the listings even in those arrondissements we haven't mentioned above.\\n\\nSome nightclubs in Paris that are worth it: Folies Pigalle (pl. Pigalle, 18th, very trashy, \\u20ac20), Rex Club (near one of the oldest cinemas on earth, the Grand Rex, house/electro, about \\u20ac15). You might also want to try Cabaret (Palais Royal), Maison Blanche, le Baron (M Alma-Marceau). Remember when going out to dress to impress, you are in Paris! Torn clothing and sneakers are not accepted. The better you look, the more likely you will get past the random decisions of club bouncers. Also important to remember if male (or in a group of guys) that it will be more difficult to enter clubs; try to always have an equal male/female ratio.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n=== Hotels ===\\nBeing often declared the most popular travel destination in the world, Paris has far over a thousand hotels to choose from, and even more in the surrounding [[Ile-de-France]] region. The choice may be overwhelming, but should be made carefully. There are huge differences in standards and location is key to make your stay in Paris enjoyable and time used well. Be prepared to pay the price for Paris' popularity - even the cheap hotels are relatively expensive.\\n\\nDespite the popularity with tourists, global hotel chains have relatively low penetration of the Parisian market. A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered. There is a fair amount of Best Westerns as well, but most international chains limit their presence to very few exclusive (and expensive) hotels in key locations. Travellers loyal to a particular brand may find their loyalty challenged, be forced to pay for it (rather than be rewarded) or unable to find their hotel brand of choice in Paris.\\n\\nHotels in the central arrondissements tend to be expensive, although very cheap ones can also be found. With few exceptions, they tend to offer small rooms - be aware of the fact that the difference in price between hotels can translate into difference in service, facility and appointment levels, but not necessarily room size. Rooms of 12-16 square metres (which is roughly half of standard hotels rooms e.g. in the USA) are the norm in central Paris, regardless of hotel standards.\\n\\nCheaper hotels in popular arrondissements tend to be older, less attractive properties, whose facilities and appointments may be very worn and outdated, far behind standards one would expect from the capital of all things pretty and fine. Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.\\n\\nHotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the ''Peripherique'' and Paris itself, can be far cheaper and better value for money than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, you should check thoroughly how far from the metro / RER station the given hotel is, and whether the connection to the POIs you want to visit is direct, quick and easy. Do also factor in the added cost of transportation to outer zones, as well as the time spent to travel to and from the city and obviously resulting limitations.\\n\\nBecause of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called \\\"''douche italienne''\\\" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.\\n\\nParis hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low seasons. These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around the Christmas season.\\n\\nFor individual hotel listings see the various [[#Districts|Arrondissement]] pages. <!-- please add individual hotel listings on the various Arrondissement pages -->\\n\\n=== Apartment rentals ===\\nFor those staying for a week or more, renting a furnished apartment might be a more comfortable and money-saving option, especially for 3 or more adults. Furnished apartments can differ considerably in location and quality, offer different accommodations and selections of appliances and kitchen features, or may be well-above street level with no elevator. Expect apartment sizes to be modest. Access to local public transport can also vary widely. So choose carefully only after getting a full description of an interesting property.\\n\\nMany websites will help you find rentals. Some do a more disciplined job of locating and describing properties and their locale. Most charge a commission of 10% or more; some offer insurance covering some risks. Some may offer a few apartments for shorter stays, usually at somewhat higher cost per day.\\n\\nIn late-spring and summer months, desirable properties may be in short supply. If your plans are fairly firm for those periods, you would be wise to \\\"reserve\\\" a unit well in-advance. Owners will often ask for a non-refundable deposit of up to 50% of the total cost of your stay. Means of payment can range from money order to PayPal or (occasionally) charge card. (Take great care of how and with whom you share any charge card account number.) You should send no payment to any post office box or similarly anonymous place or account...even after exchanging e-mails with a purported owner; most are no more than \\\"blind\\\" scams to take your money.\\n\\nThe city government has passed ordinances that require owners renting properties for short periods to collect a tax previously collected only by hotels. This substantial tax may not be collected by some owners, or may be demanded by them but not mentioned in their rates until you arrive. Tax enforcement and collection remain in a state of flux.\\n\\nSome agencies, rental brokers or web sites, that seem amicable, attractive or claim reputations, do not abide by French law to carefully vet and select landlords and apartments they offer for rent. There are a certain number of guarantees, which are required in France before renting an apartment, and an insurance policy, which aims at protecting the tenants during their stay.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Crime===\\nDespite what many naysayers might say or believe, Paris is still a relatively safe city. This does not stop it from being plagued by petty [[crime]], especially [[pickpocketing]], and muggings. Scams, of which there are many, are also prevalent, though the police are slowly cracking down on them. While not common, purse snatchings do happen. Violent crime is rare. However, watch yourself at ATMs and other places where your cash may be visible. Keep your money and your wallet in your front pockets, and avoid ATMs that are open to the outside, especially at night.\\n\\nAs a densely populated city with equally dense neighbourhoods, one would be remiss to generalise the safety of entire 'arrondissements' based on a few specific areas. Several arrondissements have their share of crime, however. The 18th, 19th, and 20th arrondissements are widely seen as the least safe areas of Paris, but safety levels vary dramatically from street to street. During the day, they're usually fine; you might have to watch out for pickpockets and scammers, but not much more. However, be on your guard at night. The 10th arrondissement (namely the areas bordering the 18th and 19th arrondissements) and the southeastern portion of the \\\"p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique\\\" have also gained a reputation for being sketchy.\\n\\nSeveral of the inner suburbs of the metropolitan area (commonly referred to as the ''banlieues'') such as La Courneuve, [[Saint-Denis (\\u00cele-de-France)|Saint-Denis]], Sarcelles, and Pantin are notoriously 'rough' by European standards, and you should be cautious when visiting these places. Unrest in those areas has made global headline news (as did the somewhat heavy-handed reactions of various French governments).\\n\\nThe police can be reached by phone by dialling 17. Not all police officers speak English, but those found around touristy areas almost always will. They are usually friendly and perfectly approachable should you have to.\\n\\n==== Theft in public transit ====\\nThe m\\u00e9tro and RER are also a popular place for pickpockets. '''Hold things tightly and be aware of your surroundings.''' While trains are usually crowded, if someone is insisting and hovers over you, they are probably going through your pockets. It is important to know that a majority of these belong to a gang. These gangs usually use young children as young as seven, with groups of them going around the metro stations pickpocketing tourists and locals alike. If there is a group of three or more suspicious looking people, be careful of your belongings. This is a notable occurrence on M\\u00e9tro line 13, tramways, and the RER B.\\n\\nCommon tactics are two of them blocking you as you try to board the subway, with two behind you quickly going through your bag. Seconds before the doors close, the two jump off, leaving you on the metro without even realizing what has happened. Take note of what locals do. If someone warns you to be careful, there are probably some suspicious types hoping to steal from you. Also be aware that phone-snatching is the most reported crime, and avoid using your cellphone on metro platforms and in the metro itself.\\n\\nPickpockets are active on the rail link (RER B) from Charles de Gaulle airport to downtown Paris, which passes through the poor suburbs of Seine-Saint Denis. Try to take the trains which are nonstop between the airport and Paris proper (Gare du Nord) - EKLI/EKIL from Paris to CDG and KRIN/KROL from CDG to Paris. These are faster and are less crowded than the alternative.\\n\\nThere have also been problems with thieves physically fighting people in order to steal their belongings. The most common targets are those with suitcases and backpacks, i.e. tourists. Thieves usually coin their acts with the closing of the doors. Newer trains have cameras everywhere, and thieves are much less likely to use them. Otherwise, stow luggage on the racks above the seat (which is not possible in newer trains) and hold on to your bags so no one can grab them and then run out. You are much less likely of being a victim if the train is crowded with locals headed to work, usually at rush hour.\\n\\nThe train conductors are widely aware of these crimes and will usually wait a few seconds to leave the station after the doors have closed, just in case thieves have quickly jumped off with belongings. There are also emergency cords that one can pull if willing to chase after the attackers. People will usually be helpful and gladly call the police if you do not have a cell phone.\\n\\n==== Theft in tourist hotspots ====\\nPickpockets are most likely to be found working at crowded tourists hotspots, so keep your wallet and phone in your front pockets and hold your backpack tightly when in a crowd.\\n\\nA common place for phone/camera/wallet snatching is in tourist friendly dining areas scattered all over Paris where exposed outdoor tables are commonly right on busy sidewalks. Common practice by many Western tourists is to leave an aforementioned item of value on the table (most commonly a smartphone) in front of them. Some of the criminals, working in groups of three to five people, approach your table and shove what appears to be a survey directly under your nose thus blocking your view of your valuable. While the gang members are yelling in a foreign language another one will slip a hand below your view and take your item of value from the table. This occurs very quickly (less than five seconds) and the perpetrators disappear around the corner just as quick as they arrived.\\n\\nKey landmarks like the Louvre or the Eiffel tower have been plagued with gangs of pickpockets, which typically operate in groups of about five. As many as half a dozen of these gangs may be active at a particularly famous, crowded venue at any one time; occasionally there are fights between rival gangs of thieves. Asian visitors are often targeted due to a presumption that they are visiting from affluent nations. Venue staff have complained of being spat at, threatened, abused or assaulted by pickpocketing gangs; the Louvre closed briefly in 2013 (as did the Eiffel tower in 2015) due to worker protests of unsafe conditions due to criminal activity. Token attempts to deploy more police have not solved the problems.<!-- http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32844573 -->\\n\\n==== Scams ====\\n[[File:People at Montmartre \\\"selling\\\" trinkets.JPG|right|thumb|The men who will try to tie strings on your fingers]]\\nAt Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur, there are many men who will try to tie strings or bracelets on your finger (often called \\\"string muggers\\\"). Not only will they demand an obscene fee for the cheap trinkets (usually over \\u20ac15), they will also try to pickpocket you or threaten you with force if you do not give them money. They are usually only at the base of the monument and can be avoided by taking the Funicular of Montmartre. Otherwise, you can quickly walk past them and ignore them, though they will readily grab people's arms and have even been known to target children of tourists. Yelling at them may cause unwanted attention and cause them to back off, but be careful. Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur appears to be the only area where they congregate, but they have been sighted also near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nBesides them, you will notice many people walking around with cheap trinkets at touristy areas, especially the Trocad\\u00e9ro, Eiffel Tower, and Louvre Museum. They are generally not rude, but buying things from them is illegal and hurts small businesses. Of course, they bolt at the sight of the police, and you may end up in the middle of a stampede!\\n\\nBe careful around Barb\\u00e8s-Rochechouart and the bars near Moulin Rouge. A very common [[clip joint]] trick is played here which might cost you up to \\u20ac500. The agents standing outside will force you to enter a bar and just have a look for 5 minutes. The moment you order a drink (about \\u20ac5), a girl will approach you and start talking generally, and leave in 10\\u201315 minutes. After a harmless conversation with the girls when you request a bill, you will encounter a charge of say \\u20ac200-500 as 'service fees' for the services rendered by the girl! In case you resist paying, the bouncers will start intimidating you to try to extract money from your wallet. In such cases, threaten them that you are calling the police and informing the local embassy. Try to buy some time and start creating a ruckus. However, do not try to start a fight with the bouncers. This trick is common to many European big cities.\\n\\nOne scam involves a \\\"helpful\\\" local buying a ticket for you. Normally, tourists buy 1-day, 3-day or longer Paris Visite passes. They would tell you that your single trip ticket has expired and bring you to the ticketing machine to purchase day passes. Then they would select the 3 day pass for adults (even though you may be a student) and deliberately show you the price on the screen. Everything else is in French so you would not understand a thing. They would proceed to purchase with a credit card and while entering the PIN code, get you to turn your back on them. They then sneakily change the ticket to a single trip ticket and ask for payment for a 3-day ticket from you. Unsuspecting tourists would pay the full sum thinking it is a 1-day or 3-day pass when it is only a useless ticket. Buy the tickets yourself to avoid situations like these, as machines are available in English and other languages. If you feel threatened, call the police and don't physically handle the ticket if they forcibly purchase without your agreement.\\n\\nAnother common scam is found along the banks of the Seine river and involves a ring. This involves thieves \\\"finding\\\" a ring which they give to you. They then ask you if you own it. When you say no, they insist you keep it, saying it goes against their religion or they cannot wear rings. A few moments later, they ask you for money to buy something to eat, eventually following you and becoming more annoying. You can either yell at them or steer them towards an area where there are likely to be police present, at which point they will quickly run away.\\n\\nThe most common scam (besides pickpocketing) that has taken over Paris by storm since June 2011 involves women coming up to tourists with pledge sheets. They pretend to be deaf people collecting money for one charity or another. Once you are distracted with the petition, an accomplice pickpockets you and takes your belongings. In addition, once you sign, they point to a thing that reads \\\"minimum ten euro donation.\\\" While they may at first insist on this, shaking your head and walking away will usually make them pester someone else. Otherwise, simply waving them off and a loud no should make them give up. If they are in a large group, as is common, be careful of your belongings! This is a ploy to pickpocket you as you are surrounded by them. At this point, yelling for the police will make them disperse quickly. This is most commonly found around major tourist sites, but has also been a problem at Gare du Nord, though this has gotten much better.\\n\\nNever bet money on a 3-card game as you will always lose. This trick is played by con artists on some of the bridges on River Seine near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nA more modern scam takes place on ride-sharing apps such as Bolt. The \\\"driver\\\" will send you a message, saying you need to provide your mobile number in order to \\\"confirm\\\" the booking (this is not true; no such rule exists). Once you have done so, they will then attempt to use your number to sign into an account on another app (such as Uber), and send you another message on the first app requesting your confirmation code (which you will have received in a text message from the second app after you gave out your number). They will use another made-up excuse (\\\"Uber now runs Bolt operations in Paris\\\") to talk you into doing this. If the scam is a success, they will have access your account, and can run up massive bills by booking rides in your name. As such, if you receive such a message, do not engage, just cancel the ride and report the driver as a scammer. The app should then refund your cancellation fee. \\n\\nIt is a good idea to steer clear of the suburb of Seine Saint-Denis, as this suburb is known for its gangs and poverty, though there is little of interest to tourists anyway (except the Basilique de Saint-Denis, but that is located near a m\\u00e9tro station). You may want to avoid walking alone at night in the 18th and 19th arrondissements as well, as these can be a little shady at night. There is a large problem with youths from the depressed suburbs causing trouble with the police. If locals are moving away, it is most likely from a confrontation. While these groups rarely target people besides the police, be careful. Walk away from a situation that could lead to fights or worse.\\n\\nIn general, remember to be aware of pickpockets, as they act by trying to distract you. Avoid showing off expensive phones or a lot of money in public transportation or in open areas. Put your things in a money belt or your front pockets, but never in the back pockets.\\n\\n====Danger for identifiably Jewish people====\\nParis has the largest Jewish community in Europe and the 6th largest in the world. However, antisemitic acts have increased in France since the early 2000s, culminating with the January 2015 \\u00cele-de-France attacks targeting a local kosher supermarket. Attacks on Jews have since decreased and as of 2023, there have been no recent reports of attacks against tourists of Jewish faith. After 2015, the French government assigned thousands of soldiers to guard synagogues and Jewish schools. Still, fearing harassment or attacks, many of the local Jews no longer wear a kippa/yarmulke in the street or public transportation. So consider taking the advice of local Jews regarding your behavior. For example, if you wear a kippa, consider wearing it under a hat that is not identifiably Jewish.\\n\\n==Respect==\\n\\nParisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant. While this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris still is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is \\\"''bien \\u00e9lev\\u00e9''\\\" (well brought up). It will make getting about considerably easier.\\n\\nParisians' abrupt exteriors will rapidly evaporate if you display some basic courtesies. A simple \\\"''Bonjour, Madame''\\\" when entering a shop, for example, or \\\"''Excusez-moi''\\\" when trying to get someone's attention, are very important; say \\\"''Pardon''\\\" or better \\\"''je suis d\\u00e9sol\\u00e9''\\\" if you bump into someone accidentally or make other mistakes. If you speak French or are using a phrasebook remember to always use the vous form when addressing someone you don't know; this may transform the surliest shop assistant into a smiling helper or the grumpiest inhabitant to a helpful citizen. Courtesy is extremely important in France (where the worst insult is to call someone \\\"''mal \\u00e9lev\\u00e9''\\\", or \\\"badly brought up\\\").\\n\\nIf you only learn one long phrase in French a good one would be \\\"''Excusez-moi de vous d\\u00e9ranger, monsieur/madame, auriez-vous la gentillesse de m'aider?''\\\" (pardon me for bothering you, sir/madam, would you have the kindness to help me?) - this level of extreme politeness is about the closest one can come to a magic wand for unlocking Parisian hospitality. If you know some French, try it! But remember, too, that Parisians have places to go and things to do, so if they have no time and don't answer you, don't take it personally. Many Parisians, given time, will go out of their way to help, especially if you make an effort to speak their language and act polite to them.\\n\\nMost foreigners tend to ignore two basic rules of courtesy in metro and train transport in Paris. If the carriage is full and you're sitting on a folding seat, you should consider standing up. If you stand next to the door, you are expected to get down to the platform at a stop so that people inside can find their way out.  Once they have got out, you can go back. However, don't always expect that others will do the same for you and, if the train is full, get ready to get down with enough time in advance. In a corridor, when pushing a door, you are expected to hold it for the next person, so that it won't close abruptly. This rule is strictly observed in the metro, and quite commonly everywhere else.\\n\\nIn addition, if you are traveling to or from the airport or train station and have luggage with you, make certain that you are not blocking the aisles in the train by leaving your bags on the floor. The RER B (which links both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports to the city) has luggage racks above the seats (on the newer trains, there are no such racks above the seats, but racks dedicated to luggage in between some seats); it is best to use them so you do not block the path of a local who is getting off the train before the airport stop. On the m\\u00e9tro and especially in the RER, don't take up extra seats with your luggage. There are luggage racks and spaces between the seats.\\n\\nThere are hefty fines for littering in Paris, especially with dog droppings (often you'll find free plastic bag dispensers around parks or playgrounds).\\n\\n==Connect==\\nAs of Sept 2021, Paris has 5G from all French carriers. Wifi is widely available in public places, transport, cafes and so on.\\n\\nOne helpful thing about having official and numbered districts in Paris is that you can easily tell which arrondissement an address is in by its postal code, and can easily come up with the postal code for a Paris address if you know its arrondissement. The rule is just pre-pend 750 or 7500 to the front of the arrondissement number, with 75001 being the postal code for the 1st and 75011 being the postal code for the 11th, and so on. The 16th has two postal codes, 75016 for the portion south of Rue de Passy and 75116 to the north; all other arrondissements only have one postal code.\\n\\nPhone cards are available from most \\\"tabacs\\\" but make sure you know where you can use them when you buy them, as some places still sell the ''cartes cabines'' which are hard to use as ''cabines'' are rare.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\nFamous for its status as \\\"fashion capital\\\", Paris isn't as conservative in dress as one might think. Parisians will tolerate all kinds of clothes as long as they're worn \\\"avec style\\\" (with style). That's why men do not usually wear shorts shorter than above the knee outside of sporting events: it is not considered indecent but may stand out from the locals; shorts are for \\\"schoolboys and

Built by Gustave Eiffel in 1887-1889, the tower was almost torn down in 1909 and only saved due to its use as a telegraphy antenna. The queues can be very long. The tower allows online reservations at its website. You can select a date and time frame. If you miss the time on your ticket, you have lost your money. The north, west, and east pillars have elevators that go to the first and second floors; the south pillar has stairs that can be climbed to the second floor. To reach the top floor, an additional elevator ride is required, and the wait for this can be very long as well. Disabled visitors are not allowed beyond the second floor due to safety concerns. Taking the M\\u00e9tro as far as Ecole Militiare and then strolling up the Champ de Mars is a lovely way to arrive at the tower. Another phenomenal approach is to exit the Metro at Trocadero and see the Eiffel Tower from the other side of the Ecole Militaire.\\n}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=l'Assembl\\u00e9e Nationale | alt= | url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/ | email=\\n| address=33, quai d'Orsay | lat=48.862192 | long=2.318716 | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 40 63 60 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=M F Sa 08:40-11:40 and 14:00-17:00 | price=\\n| wikipedia=National Assembly (France) | image=Paris Assemblee Nationale DSC00074.jpg | wikidata=Q193582\\n| content=Guided tours conducted all day, ID required.

Quite up-market and quiet, it is the largest arrondissement by both area and population. Housing over 230,000 inhabitants and providing around 150,000 jobs, it is dense with residential and office developments, including the high rise skyline of ''Front de Seine'' along the northern part of the 15th's bank of the river. On the other hand, it sees relatively little tourist traffic \\u2014 but that does not mean it is devoid of attractions.\\n\\nThe famous skyscraper ''Tour Montparnasse'' and the neighbouring railway station ''Gare Montparnasse'' are on the eastern border of the 15th arrondissement, although the actual district of ''Montparnasse'' is right across the border in the [[Paris/14th arrondissement|14th arrondissement]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Paris 15e arrondissement - Quartiers.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|The four administrative quarters of the 15th arrondissement]]\\nThe 15th arrondissement is further broken up administratively into four ''quartiers'': Grenelle, Necker, Saint-Lambert and Javel.\\n\\n'''Grenelle''' is the quarter closest to the [[Paris/7th arrondissement|7th arrondissement]] and thus directly neighbouring the ''Champ de Mars'' and the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, it houses many hotels advertising the proximity of the Tower. The waterfront part of Grenelle is home to the 1970s high-rise residential development of ''Beaugrenelle'', and the eponymous shopping mall. The more inland parts of the quarter are filled with 19th-century ''Haussmannian'' buildings, interspersed with some more modern ones.\\n\\nThe quarter of '''Necker''', situated between Grenelle and the quarter of ''Montparnasse'' of the [[Paris/14th arrondissement|14th arrondissement]], is home to some of the locations named after Montparnasse, most notably the ''Tour Montparnasse'' and ''Gare Montparnasse''. It also houses more large public service and commercial buildings, such as the expansive ''H\\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades''. Otherwise, it is full of late 20th-century residential buildings, with many fewer Haussmannian structures than Grenelle.\\n\\nThe southeast quarter of '''Saint-Lambert''' is most known for the ''Parc des expositions de la porte de Versailles'', which is one of the largest and most important exhibition centres in France and Europe.\\n\\nThe southwestern '''quartier Javel''' had long been an industrial area of Paris, but has been reclaimed as office, residential, and recreational over the decades. It contains the ''Parc Andr\\u00e9 Citro\\u00ebn'', created over the former Citro\\u00ebn factory grounds, and the Heliport of Paris in its southern extremity.<!--The 15th, the largest arrondissement of central Paris, remains heavily residential, up-market and quiet - not a great deal of obvious attractions for the traveller here, apart from the Montparnasse Tower (Tour Montparnasse). Some parts of the arrondissement are close to the Eiffel Tower which actually is in the 7th. Other sights include the Montparnasse Cemetery where Jean-Paul Sartre and Charles Baudelaire are buried, Theatre de la Gaite, and Theatre du Montparnasse. Montparnasse Station (Gare Montparnasse) is a busy hub serving southwest France as well as Spain and Portugal. It is a real Parisian district with a vibrant and lively atmosphere.-->\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{Mapframe|48.841328|2.300292|zoom=13}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q50716}}\\n\\n[[Image:Bir Hakeim Bridge Soldier.jpg|thumb|250px|The Bir Hakeim Bridge Soldier, with the Eiffel Tower in the background]][[File:Paris-ile-des-cygnes-statue-de-la-liberte-tour-eiffel-seine.jpg|thumb|L'\\u00eele aux cygnes, ''statue de la Libert\\u00e9'', Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi]][[File:Cristaux.Jean Yves Lechevallier.jpg|thumb|Sculpture ''Cristaux'' in parc B\\u00e9la Bart\\u00f3k.

Almost everything there is focused on serving the offshore oil and gas industry. Unlike every other town in this part of Alaska, there are very few tourism based business or attractions.\\n\\n==Get in==\\nNikiski is accessible by road via the Kenai Spur Highway. The airport is a single gravel strip with no scheduled flights. The next nearest airport is in Kenai. Due to being an important port for the oil and gas business, marine access is restricted and there is no public use harbor. You can rent a car or get a taxi in Kenai or Soldotna.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nYou will almost certainly want a car. Nikiski is not pedestrian or bike friendly, and there are areas near the fertilizer and natural gas plants where stopping your vehicle is prohibited. These areas don't smell particularly nice either.\\n\\n==See==\\nTo get here by road from Anchorage you will have traveled through some of the most spectacular scenery on earth. That's all behind you in Nikiski. While you can still ''see'' the mountains on the other side of Cook Inlet from here, the main thing you will see is run down strip malls, abandoned hotels, and giant petrochemical plants, that seem very out of place in coastal Alaska, but serve as a vital economic engine for the local economy.\\n\\nHowever, if you just keep driving for another 25 minutes or so, you will reach a very nice recreation area, detailed in the next section.\\n\\n==Do==\\n[[File:Industrial pier Salamatof beach.jpg|thumb|Beach below Nikiski, with large piers from the industrial sites.]]\\nDue to its large tax base from energy development, Nikiski has more infrastructure than one might expect for such a small, relatively isolated area. In addition to the building of new schools and the purchase of new fire trucks and rescue boats, Nikiski also has a publicly-owned indoor water park and pool that you can access for a small fee. \\n[[File:Beach from bluff at Captain Cook.jpg|thumb|Beach and mudflats below the campground]]\\nAbout fifteen miles past Nikiski, at the very end of the Spur Highway, is the Captain Cook State Recreation Area. This park has a large wooded campground, a lake, and long beach along the shores of Cook Inlet. The campground is regularly visited by bears; do not leave food or beverages unattended at any time. There is also road access to the beach, but it is not recommended to drive on unless you have four-wheel-drive, high ground clearance, and experience driving on both deep sand and large rocks. Tides in Cook Inlet can be extreme and you may need to head to higher ground as the tide comes in. There are mudflats in this area during low tides. Do not enter these areas as they are extremely hazardous to all pedestrians and vehicles. If you become stuck (which you will) the tide will eventually come back in and flood the area. \\n\\nThe park is also the terminus of the Swanson River canoe trail. The River offers fishing for salmon on the summer months.\\n\\nThere are also several public lakes in this area with decent fishing for dolly varden and other trout species. While the access is public, the other land around these lakes is private, and in most cases well populated.

It is the wealthiest region of the city on average, although it does contain some poorer areas, especially in the extreme south.\\n\\nThe region contains residential, commercial and a few industrial areas. Its residential areas are highly verticalized, and nowadays contain some of the most expensive places to live in the city. The region's main landmark and attraction is '''Parque do Ibirapuera''', one of the largest and most important areas of green, leisure and culture of the city. The region also contains the gigantic '''Morumbi Shopping-Shopping Market Place''' commercial center, an indoor commercial center with more than 600 shops and dozens of restaurants, one of the favorite places of high-income consumers in the city.\\n\\nThe South Central region is composed of 7 districts, grouped in 3 subprefectures:\\n* '''Vila Mariana subprefecture''': Vila Mariana, Moema, Sa\\u00fade\\n* '''Santo Amara subprefecture''': Campo Belo, Santo Amaro, Campo Grande\\n* '''Jabaquara subprefecture''': Jabaquara.\\n\\n''Note: Avenida Paulista is partly in the South Central region. For places on this avenue and up to 4 blocks from it, check the [[S\\u00e3o Paulo/Paulista]] section.''\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[Image:JapanesePavillionSaoPaulo.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Pavilh\\u00e3o Japon\\u00eas, Parque do Ibirapuera. The South Central region contains a large and active Japanese community.]]\\nAlthough the South Central looks more or less homogeneous when compared to its contrast-filled neighbors, it may be separated in two areas in terms of history. The north and east part of the district ('''Vila Mariana, Moema, Sa\\u00fade e Jabaquara''') emerged with the growth of S\\u00e3o Paulo in south direction, and are strongly residential with middle to high class neighborhoods, with high level of verticalization. These districts contain a large number of descendants of Japanese immigrants, who typically have moved from other parts of the city after their social ascension. Annually, the region hosts the ''Festival do Jap\\u00e3o'', the largest event of the Japanese community of S\\u00e3o Paulo.\\n\\nThe southwest part of the district ('''Santo Amaro, Campo Belo and Campo Grande''') were until 1935 part of the municipality of Santo Amaro, which also included what today is S\\u00e3o Paulo's Far South region. Santo Amaro was the center of this municipality, and remains until the present the day as the \\\"center more important than the center\\\" for many people that live in the districts corresponding to the extinguished municipality. Today, Santo Amaro, Campo Belo and Campo Grande form an important business and industrial area for S\\u00e3o Paulo, and that is where the '''Congonhas Airport''' is located. However, the continuous expansion of S\\u00e3o Paulo in south direction has resulted in residential growth to also \\\"invade\\\" these districts.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By Metro and train===\\nThe South Central region is served by three Metro lines; Lilac, Blue, and Green and one train line, Emerald. These are the Metro and train stations located at each district:\\n* '''Vila Mariana''': Para\\u00edso, Ana Rosa, Vila Mariana, Hospital S\\u00e3o Paulo, Santa Cruz, Ch\\u00e1cara Klabin\\n* '''Sa\\u00fade''': Pra\\u00e7a da \\u00c1rvore, Sa\\u00fade-Ultrafarma, S\\u00e3o Judas \\n* '''Jabaquara''': Concei\\u00e7\\u00e3o, Jabaquara\\n* '''Santo Amaro''': Borba Gato, Alto da Boa Vista, Adolfo Pinheiro, Largo Treze, Santo Amaro, Socorro, Morumbi;\\n* '''Campo Grande''': Jurubatuba\\n* '''Moema''': Eucaliptos, Moema, AACD\\u2013Servidor\\n* '''Campo Belo''': Brooklyn, Campo Belo\\n\\n===By car===\\n\\nMost parts of the region can be reached by car from '''Corredor Norte-Sul''', originating from the Center, '''Av. dos Bandeirantes''', originating from the West, and '''Av. Dr. Ricardo Jafet''', originating from the Southeast. Depending on where you are and where do you want to go other ways may be more efficient.\\n\\n===By bus===\\n\\nFor buses, check the [http://www.sptrans.com.br SPTrans] website for routes and itineraries (only in Portuguese).\\n\\n==Get around==\\n{{mapframe|-23.63600|-46.66714|height=450|width=400|zoom=12|}}\\n{{mapshapes|Q483343}} <!-- Metro -->\\n{{mapshapes|Q1121227}} <!-- CPTM -->\\n{{mapshape|wikidata=Q18479100,Q7420462,Q9685950,Q10304645, Q454586,Q9300178,Q7929996}}\\nThe metro, train, bus and car are the natural way of getting around in the region. Outside Parque do Ibirapuera, the South Central is not great in terms of sightseeing and has not many interesting places to be explored on foot.\\n\\n===On foot===\\n\\nVisitors who want to see less cars and more people may explore the area of '''Largo 13 de Maio''', the ''de facto'' \\\"city center\\\" of the extinguished municipality of Santo Amaro. For those who prefer more upscale places, one option is '''Avenida Ibirapuera''' and its surroundings, in Moema.\\n\\n===By bicycle===\\n\\n'''Cycleway Marginal Pinheiros''' (see [[S\\u00e3o Paulo| S\\u00e3o Paulo main section]]) is partly located in the South Central. There are also approximately 3.3 km of cycleways in Moema, located at Av. Pav\\u00e3o, Av. Rouxinol and Av. Ira\\u00ed, that all cross Av. Ibirapuera. There are other 6.5 km of \\\"cycle routes\\\" in the same region, where cyclists have preference but not a dedicated lane.\\n\\nA large portion of '''Ciclofaixa de Lazer''' (see [[S\\u00e3o Paulo| S\\u00e3o Paulo main article]]) is also in the South Central region and it is a great way to explore the region on two wheels.\\n\\n==See==\\n[[Image:View ibirapuera.jpg|thumb|250px|Parque do Ibirapuera during sunset]]\\n[[Image:Pavilhao oca ibirapuera.jpg|thumb|250px|The Oca, Parque do Ibirapuera]]\\n* {{see\\n| name=Parque do Ibirapuera | alt=Ibirapuera park | url=http://www.visitsp.com/parque_do_ibirapuera.html | email=\\n| address= | lat=-23.588333 | long=-46.658889 | directions=entrance by avenues Rep\\u00fablica do L\\u00edbano and Pedro \\u00c1lvares Cabral\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=free\\n| wikipedia=Ibirapuera Park | image=Parque ibirapuera1.jpg | wikidata=Q212248\\n| content=With 1.5 million m\\u00b2, this is the most frequented leisure area in S\\u00e3o Paulo. It has paths for walking and jogging, bikeways, woods, lakes, sport courts and areas for relaxation that attract city residents of all ages. Bicycles can be rented also. It receives up to 150 thousand visitors on weekends. There are other important attractions at Ibirapuera, listed below. It also has frequent free music presentations by national and international artists. Ibirapuera was inaugurated in 1954, during the celebrations for the city\\u2019s fourth centennial. Oscar Niemeyer, renowned Brazilian architect, designed several of the buildings. Watch joggers, dog-walkers and all kinds of street vendors, and sit down on a patch of grass and listen to the birds singing: this is one of the few places in S\\u00e3o Paulo where you can do just that. If you feel like it, you can even enjoy a Caipirinha from one of the cardbord-box bars you will find close to the entrances. Also buy the sweet and tasty coconut/nougat-sweets that are sold by many vendors in the park. Nearest Metro is \\\"Vila Mariana\\\" and then a short taxi ride, a bus or a 20-minute walk down the Rua Sena Madureira. You also can walk for around 20 minutes through Brigadeiro Luiz Antonio Avenue, from \\\"Brigadeiro\\\" Station (Green Line), in Avenida Paulista. You also can take a bus from the station directly.\\n}}\\n** {{see\\n| name=Museu de Arte Moderna | alt=Museum of Modern Art, MAM | url=http://www.mam.org.br/ | email=\\n| address=Parque do Ibirapuera, port\\u00e3o 3 - s/n\\u00ba | lat=-23.587734 | long=-46.655784 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=S\\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Modern Art | image=Museu de Arte Moderna, S\\u00e3o Paulo - Fachada.jpg | wikidata=Q1581634\\n| content=With excellent exhibits, a varied schedule of independent movies and a boutique restaurant.\\n}}\\n** {{see\\n| name=Oca | alt=Pavilh\\u00e3o Gov.

During the postwar occupation, it was the site of the Washington Heights residence for U.S. officers. It later was selected as the site for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and the distinctive Olympic buildings designed by Kenzo Tange are still nearby. In 1967, it was made into a city park.  Today, the park is a popular hangout, especially on Sundays, when it is used as a gathering place for people to play music, practice martial arts, etc. The park has a bike path, and bicycle rentals are available. As a consequence of Japan's long recession, there are several large, but surprisingly quiet and orderly, homeless camps around the park's periphery.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{mapframe|35.671|139.703|zoom=14}}\\n{{Mapmask|35.6689,139.6910|35.6678,139.6918|35.6682,139.6933|35.6684,139.6998|35.6693,139.7024|35.6645,139.7017|35.6638,139.7040|35.6613,139.7078|35.6630,139.7104|35.6642,139.7087|35.6652,139.7097|35.6658,139.7102|35.6670,139.7113|35.6672,139.7110|35.6698,139.7133|35.6705,139.7137|35.6719,139.7127|35.6733,139.7125|35.6757,139.7127|35.6746,139.7070|35.6777,139.7060|35.6795,139.7047|35.6805,139.7045|35.6800,139.7009|35.6810,139.6985|35.6809,139.6975|35.6801,139.6961|35.6797,139.6947|35.6773,139.6936|35.6742,139.6914|35.6697,139.6908|35.6689,139.6910}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q682894}} <!-- Tokyo Metro -->\\n{{Mapshapes|Q247782}} <!-- Toei Subway -->\\n{{Mapshape|title=Rinkai Line|wikidata=Q225095|type=geoline|stroke=#00b48d|stroke-width=4|stroke-opacity=1}}\\n{{Mapshape|title=Tokyo Monorail|wikidata=Q8015774|type=geoline|stroke=#ff0000|stroke-width=4|stroke-opacity=1}}\\n\\n===By train===\\n'''JR Harajuku Station''' on the Yamanote Line is the obvious way to get to Harajuku.

The subway is better than JR for getting here from central Tokyo, but the Yamanote Line is easier if you are coming from Tokyo Station. The nearby '''Omotesando''' Station (on the Ginza and Hanzomon subway lines) is further down Omote-sand\\u014d near the intersection with Aoyama-dori. Omotesando station has a variety of boutiques and restaurants in the underground station complex named Echika Omotesando.\\n\\n===On foot===\\nHarajuku is 15 minutes away from [[Tokyo/Shibuya|Shibuya]] by foot, just follow the train tracks along Koen-dori from the scramble crossing.

Each group stakes out its territory around '''Yoyogi Park''' (\\u4ee3\\u3005\\u6728\\u516c\\u5712 ''Yoyogi-k\\u014den''). Keep in mind that Harajuku is well known worldwide, so many tourists show up on Sundays. Best to be a bit early to avoid being stuck between big tourist groups.\\n\\n* The bridge across the train tracks sometimes has teenagers dressed up as '''Gothic Lolita''' and other extreme Japanese youth fashions. Besides just hanging out with friends, many come here to be snapped by the magazine photographers who mingle. Unfortunately, as of lately, the police seem to be cracking down on loitering, so they are becoming increasingly rare.\\n* Over by the entrance to the park, people with greased hair listen to '''rockabilly''' music and dance in their vintage jeans. This subculture has been around since the early 1980s.\\n* The sidewalks along the south side are usually occupied by '''junk vendors''' and loud '''rock bands'''. Both of these groups periodically get swept away by police crack-downs, though.\\n* The tree-lined area leading from the south end of the park to Shibuya is filled with all sorts of '''street performers''', mostly folk-pop singers, but also including hip-hop dancing and street theater.\\n\\n===Shrines===\\n[[File:MeijiShrine_Maiden.JPG|thumb|250px|Shrine maiden at Meiji Jingu, offering a bit of serenity among all the surrounding commerce]]\\n[[File:Meiji Shrine, Barrels of sake.jpg|thumb|Meiji Shrine, barrels of sake]]\\n\\n* {{see\\n| name=Meiji Shrine | alt=\\u660e\\u6cbb\\u795e\\u5bae ''Meiji Jing\\u016b'' | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.676111 | long=139.699167 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=Free\\n| content=Tokyo's grandest Shinto shrine, built in 1920 to commemorate the late Emperor Meiji, who oversaw Japan's rapid industrialization and rise to major world power status in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

North of the [[Singapore/Riverside|Singapore River]], to the west of [[Singapore/Marina Bay|Marina Bay]], Orchard Road turns into '''Tanglin Road''' to the west and '''Bras Basah Road''' as it heads east.  Only at the eastern Bras Basah end do the shopping malls briefly peter out, with some fine colonial architecture and a few of Singapore's top museums to be found instead.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[Image:Presenting..._the_real_ION_(8200217734).jpg|thumb|350px|Ion Orchard, one of Singapore's many shrines to shopping]]\\n\\nOrchard Road is named after the fruit and nutmeg orchards that used to line it in the 1830s, one of them coincidentally belonging to a Mr Orchard. The manhole covers along the road all depict various tropical fruits. Large trees still shade the road, providing a modicum of relief from the heat. Fortunately, Orchard Road has an extensive network of underpasses that connect many of the malls providing even more shelter from the blistering equatorial heat and, on occasion, rain. Weekends in the area are often packed with locals and visitors alike out to consume en masse.\\n\\nThe '''Christmas decorations''' along Orchard are mildly famous and entirely over the top, with reindeers cavorting through palm trees and gingerbread houses topped with fake snow.\\n\\n===Visitor Centre===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Singapore Visitors Centre | alt= | url=https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/getting-around/tourism-centre/ | email=\\n| address=216 Orchard Rd | lat=1.30137 | long=103.839 | directions=next to orchardgateway@emerald\\n| phone= | tollfree=1800 736 2000\\n| hours=noon-7PM daily | price=\\n| image=\\n| lastedit=2016-03-28\\n| content=Oodles of free information on Singapore.

It was named after the bloodthirsty race of pirates who prowled in the Straits before the arrival of the British. The area where Bugis Junction now stands was the original home of Singapore's small Hainanese community, famous for their large contribution to Singapore's culinary culture, before they moved to Beach Road in the early 20th century to make use of the docks and seafront. The area was then taken over by Singapore's Japanese community, and was originally populated by girls from poor families in Japan who were trafficked to Singapore to work as prostitutes. The Japanese community then grew and in their heyday just prior to World War II, were running many businesses and even had their own school and newspaper. However, the British repatriated all ethnic Japanese in Singapore after World War II, and did not allow any ethnic Japanese to enter Singapore for the next few years, thus spelling a temporary end for the Japanese community in Singapore. (The Japanese came back eventually, but these days they hang out around [[Singapore/Riverside|Robertson Quay]].)\\n\\nFor a long time after the war, the area was Singapore's equivalent of [[Bangkok/Patpong|Patpong]], a red-light district known for its bars and transvestite prostitutes or ''katies'' (the anglicized version of the Thai ''kathoey''), and was a popular hangout spot for American soldiers on their days off during the [[Indochina Wars|Vietnam War]]. However, in 1985 the area was redeveloped with a vengeance, turning it into a sanitised shopping experience for the whole family.\\n\\nNeighboring '''Kampong Glam''', also known by the name of its main thoroughfare '''Arab Street''', was where Singapore's Arab traders settled in the founding days of the colony, and was also the part of town allocated to the Malays when Raffles drew up his town plan. But here too, the original inhabitants fled in the 1920s as real estate prices drove through the roof, and today the heart of Muslim Singapore beats in Geylang Serai on the [[Singapore/East Coast|East Coast]].\\n\\nSo what's left then? A slice of modern Singapore at its most hyperactive: hundreds upon hundreds of shops and restaurants, several attractive promenades, and a bazaar selling the cheapest T-shirts in town. Head here on a weekend to experience Singaporean consumerism at its finest.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{Mapframe|1.30444|103.85944|zoom=15|staticmap=Singapore-Bugis.png|name=Map of Bugis}}\\n{{Mapmask |1.3056,103.8554 |1.3082,103.8571 |1.3119,103.8596 |1.3144,103.8601 |1.3094,103.8636 |1.3072,103.8643 |1.3044,103.8662 |1.3034,103.8670 |1.2986,103.8604 |1.2973,103.8590 |1.2983,103.8579 |1.2966,103.8564 |1.2960,103.8559 |1.2970,103.8545 |1.2968,103.8544 |1.2976,103.8533 |1.2986,103.8540 |1.3004,103.8517 |1.3031,103.8538 |1.3056,103.8554}}\\n<!-- This adds MRT lines and stations to the map -->\\n<maplink class=\\\"no-icon\\\" text=\\\"\\\" group=\\\"other\\\">\\n{\\n  \\\"type\\\": \\\"ExternalData\\\",\\n  \\\"service\\\": \\\"page\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"Sandbox/Drat70/mrt_singapore.map\\\"\\n}\\n</maplink>\\n\\nThe '''Bugis''' (East-West and Downtown lines) and '''Lavender''' (East-West line) MRT stations are the primary entry points into the district.

On '''Haji Lane''', local independent fashion boutiques and quirky little shops offer a unique shopping experience. It is a prominent location for second-hand clothing and trendy street fashion, featuring the works of local designers and imported wares from Japan and the States.\\n\\nKampong Glam is also an area dotted with good restaurants, from Malaysian coffee shops and bakeries to fine modern European dining.

It is most famous for the October 1600 Battle of Sekigahara, but its picturesque location nestled in a small valley between mountains, combined with its complete lack of large tour buses, makes it a nice day trip from the larger nearby cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Nagoya]], and [[Kanazawa]]. The small size of the town and the well-marked paths between historic sites makes Sekigahara even more appealing, as a visitor can traverse the entire battlefield in about a day.\\n\\nYou will need a solid understanding of Japanese, or a good translator, if you wish to interact with the town on a deeper level, but English-language material is available in the museums and on historical signs by the sites.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Sekigaharascreen.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the Battle of Sekigahara]]\\n\\nSekigahara was the site of the epic '''Battle of Sekigahara''' (\\u95a2\\u30f6\\u539f\\u5408\\u6226  ''Sekigahara gassen'') between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Ishida Mitsunari, representing Toyotomi Hideyoshi's son and designated successor Toyotomi Hideyori. The Cliff's Notes version: Ishida's Western Alliance had 120,000 troops against the 75,000 of Tokugawa's Eastern Alliance, but Tokugawa cleverly exploited various grievances in Ishida's ranks to convince six ''daimyo'' (regional warlords) to defect along with some 23,000 troops, tipping the scales of the battle. A mere two hours after the battle began on the morning of October 21, 1600, the Western Alliance was in tatters and a total of some 40,000 lay dead. Ishida escaped but was captured and executed on November 6th.\\n\\nTokugawa's victory on heralded the beginning of the Edo Period, and with it the rise of the Shogunate. The destruction of most of the forces of the Western Alliance allowed Tokugawa to rapidly consolidate control of Japan within the following four months, as previously-Western or neutral daimyos either joined with Tokugawa or were crushed by him. Consequently, the town is filled with ruins, memorials and shrines to the dead. (There is a river called Kurochigawa (\\u9ed2\\u8840\\u5ddd, \\\"Black Blood River\\\"), where the Tokugawa armies washed the cut-off heads of those fallen in battle, but the name had originated in the Jinshin War in the 7th century under similar circumstances.) \\n\\nToday's Sekigahara is a rural town with a population just over 7,000. Due to its historical significance, Sekigahara is sister cities with both [[Waterloo]] in [[Belgium]] and [[Gettysburg]] in the [[United States of America|US]]. It can also be inundated with Japanese tourists (particularly schoolchildren) because of its importance in Japanese history during certain parts of the Japanese school year.\\n\\n===Tourist information===\\n* {{Listing|name=Sekigahara Tourist Information Center|alt=\\u95a2\\u30f6\\u539f\\u99c5\\u524d\\u89b3\\u5149\\u4ea4\\u6d41\\u9928 Sekigahara ekimae kank\\u014d k\\u014dry\\u016b-kan|address=598-4, Sekigahara|lat=35.363542|long=136.470854|hours=09:00-17:00, closed Tu and the day after a holiday|lastedit=2024-05-02|content=The main tourist information center in town.

The Emmy-winning [[:w:Sh\\u014dgun (2024 TV series)|2024 TV series]] based on the book is also well worth a watch.\\n\\nThe classic samurai novel ''Musashi'' by Eiji Yoshikawa ({{ISBN|156836427X}}), about the real exploits of the eponymous famous swordsman, starts where Shogun ends, with Musashi fighting on the losing side at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:Battlefield of Sekigahara viewed from Ibukiyama Drive Way.jpg|thumb|Sekigahara as viewed from Ibukiyama Driveway (looking east). The battlefield and memorials are spread across the town, in the fields, and on the mountaintops.]]\\n\\nThe JR Tokaido Shinkansen line passes through Sekigahara on its way from [[Osaka]] to [[Nagoya]], but it does not stop in the town.  If coming from [[Kyoto]] (as most Western tourists tend to do), take the Shinkansen to Maibara, and then change to the JR Tokaido Line. The Shinkansen leg takes 19 minutes and the Tokaido leg takes 21 minutes, so the trip can be done in about an hour or even quicker if you time it right with trains. Make sure to take the ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' Shinkansen, as that will stop at every station (the other Shinkansen do not stop at Maibara). Maibara is the first stop going east from Kyoto on the ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' Shinkansen. If traveling on a Seishun 18 ticket or other pass that does not permit use of the Shinkansen, take the Special Rapid (\\u65b0\\u5feb\\u901f) to Maibara and change to the JR Central portion of the Tokaido line. When using the Special Rapid train, the JR West leg takes 1 hour 7 minutes. \\n\\nIf coming from Tokyo, one of two hourly ''Hikari'' services from Tokyo stops at Maibara, and you can transfer to the Tokaido Line local for the run to Sekigahara (total time 3 hours, &yen;12,070, no charge with JR Pass).\\n\\n{{go\\n| name=Sekigahara Station | alt=\\u95a2\\u30b1\\u539f\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.36372 | long=136.46998 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2024-05-02\\n| content=is a small unstaffed rural station, with two platforms (four trains) and one entrance/exit on the south side of the tracks.

Other than that, there's nothing else in the station (no restaurants, shops, etc.).\\n}}\\n\\n=== By vehicle ===\\nDriving wise, Sekigahara is at the intersection between Routes 365 (N-S) and 21 (E-W). To the south of the town lies the E1 (Meishin) expressway that runs between [[Nagoya|Komaki]] (outside of Nagoya) and [[Nishinomiya]]. Both roads meander through narrow(ish) mountain valleys in the heart of rural Japan, and while they are in good condition (as of March 2023), they are quite far from the major tourist sites (about 1.5 hours from Kyoto and 45 minutes from Nagoya). Unless you are already staying in the [[Lake Biwa]] area or around [[Ogaki]], it's faster to buy a train ticket and take the trains.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nThere are no public buses that transport people into or through the town. The only buses that bring people in are Japanese tour coaches, so non-Japanese tourists will probably not utilize buses to visit the town at all (unless they have a really solid grasp of Japanese and have decided to book one of those tours).\\n\\n==Get around==\\n{{Mapframe|35.36641|136.46489|zoom=14}}\\n\\n=== By foot ===\\nUnless you drive in (or are bused in), everyone enters (and leaves) Sekigahara via the Sekigahara Station, which is in the center of the town. The entire town can be walked within a few hours, and it's probably well within reason to state that any part of the town is within a 20- to 30-minute walk from the Station. \\n\\nSome historic sites are located on the top of hills or small mountains. While everything is easily walked, some trails are stepped (thus bicycles are not allowed) and can be quite steep. \\n\\n=== By bicycle ===\\nBicycles can be rented at the Tourist Center opposite the Station entrance, or at the Memorial Museum to the north of the Station. Some of the more distant sites are best accessed by bicycle, but there are occasional parts of the trails where bicycles must be walked and not ridden (such as over some small dams). The bicycles use pedals that don't require snap-in shoes.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nThe town operated [http://www.town.sekigahara.gifu.jp/4588.htm Fureai Bus] rotates on 5 different routes, three times a day. It's not so convenient for the time-pressed traveler; you may tour by foot, bicycle, or private vehicle.\\n\\n==See==\\n{{infobox|Fireflies|Fireflies (\\u86cd ''hotaru'') can be spotted throughout the Japanese countryside in summer. Small insects less than a centimeter long, with light organs located near their rear, they are generally unafraid of humans and can easily be 'captured', after which they will obligingly walk about on your hand for a while before flying off. Both the male and female firefly glow, but the male has two light organs and is consequently clearly brighter, while the female has only one. According to folk tradition, fireflies represent the souls of the dead, but are generally viewed in a positive light as they are thought to have the power to ward off evil.}}\\n===Battle of Sekigahara Sites===\\n[[File:Sekigahara Historial and Folklore Museum 20140206.JPG|thumb|Sekigahara Town History and Folklore Museum]]\\nWhile the ''Battle of Sekigahara'' is of major significance to Japanese history buffs and school groups, foreign visitors are rare and information in English is generally minimal. A solid grasp of Japanese and/or a local guide will come in handy here. '''Memorial posts''' (\\u9663\\u8de1 ''jin-ato'') have been set up at most major battle sites in the area, but information is in Japanese. Historic markers are set up next to the posts, which explains in Japanese and English both the significance of said post and how the battle unfolded for the person that the post commemorates (for example, the post marking Shimadzu Yoshihiro's encampment details how his forces acted in the battle).\\n* {{see\\n| name=Gifu Sekigahara Battlefield Memorial Museum | alt=\\u5c90\\u961c\\u95a2\\u30b1\\u539f\\u53e4\\u6226\\u5834\\u8a18\\u5ff5\\u9928, Gifu Sekigahara Kosenj\\u014d Kinenkan | url=https://sekigahara.pref.gifu.lg.jp/ | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.365559 | long=136.466175 | directions=just north of the Station, about a 3- to 5-minute walk up a slight hill\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\u00a5500 for adults, \\u00a5400 for students, and \\u00a5300 for kids\\n| lastedit=2023-04-04\\n| content=This new museum (built 2020) offers a good introduction to the battle itself.

The upper floors contain mainly replicas (although some original artifacts and documents are displayed) of writings relating to the battle or Tokugawa's rise to power, and then goes in depth of the aftermath of the battle and the consolidation of his rule. Kids and the young at heart will enjoy the third floor, which offers a hands-on exhibit where you can play around with different types of weapons used during the battle (such as katanas, matchlock rifles, and battle fans).

Kusatsu-Shirane (Shirane), and known for its healing waters. Water for the town originates from Mt. Shirane with a flow of more than 32,000 litres per minute. This is one of the largest natural outputs of hot spring water in Japan. The water is very acidic, having a sterilizing effect. A 6-inch nail is said to dissolve to only a small metal shard after 10 days.\\n\\nDuring the Edo period, Kusatsu became famous for its therapeutic waters. One of the shoguns at the time was said to have shipped its waters to his castle to bathe. Then, in the Meiji period, a German court physician to the emperor, Dr. Erwin B\\u00e4lz, popularized the healing effects of the water even more by researching and championing its healing properties.

Older folks will want to visit too, to see '''Meiji Shrine''' (''Meiji Jing\\u016b'') and '''Yoyogi Park'''.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nThe broad, tree-lined avenue leading downhill from the southern end of the JR station is '''Omote-sand\\u014d''' (\\u8868\\u53c2\\u9053), which leads to the upscale [[Tokyo/Aoyama|Aoyama]] district. The street is full of cafes and clothing stores. For teenagers, though, the place to be is '''Takeshita-dori''', which is a bustling narrow street several blocks to the north.\\n\\nNearby '''Yoyogi Park''' (\\u4ee3\\u3005\\u6728\\u516c\\u5712 ''Yoyogi-k\\u014den'') was the site of the first successful powered aircraft flight in Japan, on December 19, 1910, by Captain Yoshitoshi Tokugawa, following which it became an army parade ground. During the postwar occupation, it was the site of the Washington Heights residence for U.S. officers. It later was selected as the site for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and the distinctive Olympic buildings designed by Kenzo Tange are still nearby. In 1967, it was made into a city park.  Today, the park is a popular hangout, especially on Sundays, when it is used as a gathering place for people to play music, practice martial arts, etc. The park has a bike path, and bicycle rentals are available. As a consequence of Japan's long recession, there are several large, but surprisingly quiet and orderly, homeless camps around the park's periphery.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{mapframe|35.671|139.703|zoom=14}}\\n{{Mapmask|35.6689,139.6910|35.6678,139.6918|35.6682,139.6933|35.6684,139.6998|35.6693,139.7024|35.6645,139.7017|35.6638,139.7040|35.6613,139.7078|35.6630,139.7104|35.6642,139.7087|35.6652,139.7097|35.6658,139.7102|35.6670,139.7113|35.6672,139.7110|35.6698,139.7133|35.6705,139.7137|35.6719,139.7127|35.6733,139.7125|35.6757,139.7127|35.6746,139.7070|35.6777,139.7060|35.6795,139.7047|35.6805,139.7045|35.6800,139.7009|35.6810,139.6985|35.6809,139.6975|35.6801,139.6961|35.6797,139.6947|35.6773,139.6936|35.6742,139.6914|35.6697,139.6908|35.6689,139.6910}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q682894}} <!-- Tokyo Metro -->\\n{{Mapshapes|Q247782}} <!-- Toei Subway -->\\n{{Mapshape|title=Rinkai Line|wikidata=Q225095|type=geoline|stroke=#00b48d|stroke-width=4|stroke-opacity=1}}\\n{{Mapshape|title=Tokyo Monorail|wikidata=Q8015774|type=geoline|stroke=#ff0000|stroke-width=4|stroke-opacity=1}}\\n\\n===By train===\\n'''JR Harajuku Station''' on the Yamanote Line is the obvious way to get to Harajuku. The station is next to the entrance to Meiji Shrine and to the beginning of Omote-sand\\u014d.\\n\\n===By subway===\\n'''Meiji-jingu-mae''' Station (on the Chiyoda and Fukutoshin subway lines) has exits onto Meiji-dori and right in front of the entrance to Meiji Shrine, next to JR Harajuku Station. The subway is better than JR for getting here from central Tokyo, but the Yamanote Line is easier if you are coming from Tokyo Station. The nearby '''Omotesando''' Station (on the Ginza and Hanzomon subway lines) is further down Omote-sand\\u014d near the intersection with Aoyama-dori. Omotesando station has a variety of boutiques and restaurants in the underground station complex named Echika Omotesando.\\n\\n===On foot===\\nHarajuku is 15 minutes away from [[Tokyo/Shibuya|Shibuya]] by foot, just follow the train tracks along Koen-dori from the scramble crossing. (You should pass Tower Records on your right and the Yoyogi National Gymnasium on your left.)  If you have more time, see the suggested walking tour below.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\n==See==\\n\\n===Youth culture===\\n[[File:View of Yoyogi Park & Meji Shrine.JPG|300px|right|thumb|View of Yoyogi Park and Meji Shrine from Shinjuku]]\\n[[File:SpikedBlonde_Kneeling.JPG|thumb|Harajuku fashion in Yoyogi Park]]\\n\\nIf it's Harajuku's '''youth culture''' you want to see, don't even bother unless it's a Sunday. Each group stakes out its territory around '''Yoyogi Park''' (\\u4ee3\\u3005\\u6728\\u516c\\u5712 ''Yoyogi-k\\u014den''). Keep in mind that Harajuku is well known worldwide, so many tourists show up on Sundays. Best to be a bit early to avoid being stuck between big tourist groups.\\n\\n* The bridge across the train tracks sometimes has teenagers dressed up as '''Gothic Lolita''' and other extreme Japanese youth fashions. Besides just hanging out with friends, many come here to be snapped by the magazine photographers who mingle. Unfortunately, as of lately, the police seem to be cracking down on loitering, so they are becoming increasingly rare.\\n* Over by the entrance to the park, people with greased hair listen to '''rockabilly''' music and dance in their vintage jeans. This subculture has been around since the early 1980s.\\n* The sidewalks along the south side are usually occupied by '''junk vendors''' and loud '''rock bands'''. Both of these groups periodically get swept away by police crack-downs, though.\\n* The tree-lined area leading from the south end of the park to Shibuya is filled with all sorts of '''street performers''', mostly folk-pop singers, but also including hip-hop dancing and street theater.\\n\\n===Shrines===\\n[[File:MeijiShrine_Maiden.JPG|thumb|250px|Shrine maiden at Meiji Jingu, offering a bit of serenity among all the surrounding commerce]]\\n[[File:Meiji Shrine, Barrels of sake.jpg|thumb|Meiji Shrine, barrels of sake]]\\n\\n* {{see\\n| name=Meiji Shrine | alt=\\u660e\\u6cbb\\u795e\\u5bae ''Meiji Jing\\u016b'' | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.676111 | long=139.699167 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=Free\\n| content=Tokyo's grandest Shinto shrine, built in 1920 to commemorate the late Emperor Meiji, who oversaw Japan's rapid industrialization and rise to major world power status in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

On summer weekends you have a very good chance of catching a Japanese wedding in progress here; the shrine is also packed on New Year's Eve when people come here to celebrate the new year. An excellent place for those who wish to experience an oasis of tranquility among the hustle and bustle of the rest of the area.

When you reach the first major crossroad, Meiji-dori (\\u660e\\u6cbb\\u901a\\u308a), turn right.\\n\\nWhen you reach the tree-lined Omote-sand\\u014d, turn left. Omote-sand\\u014d is home to the highest of high-fashion stores, including Ralph Lauren, Coach, and Yves St. Laurent.\\n\\nThe approximate half-way point is where Omote-sand\\u014d meets Aoyama-Dori (\\u9752\\u5c71\\u901a\\u308a). There is very little of interest beyond this point, so one option is to walk back down Omote-sand\\u014d and return to Harajuku. If you elect to go forward then turn right on Aoyama-Dori and you will eventually pass United Nations University on your right, and Aoyama Gakuin University on your left, before continuing down and finishing up at Shibuya's world-famous pedestrian crossing.\\n\\nAllow yourself approximately two hours for this walk.\\n\\n===Bicycling===\\n\\n* {{do\\n| name=Yoyogi Park | alt=\\u4ee3\\u3005\\u6728\\u516c\\u5712 Yoyogi-k\\u014den | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Has a bike path and bicycle rentals are available.\\n}}\\n\\n===Salons===\\n\\nHarajuku and Omote-sand\\u014d are home to many upscale beauty salons, with prices to match.\\n\\n* {{do\\n| name=VIRGO | url=http://www.virgo-hair.com/ | email=\\n| address=2-32-3 Jingumae | lat= | long= | directions=near the BEAMS Harajuku branch\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Actresses and models sometimes use this salon.\\n}}\\n\\n==Buy==\\n[[File:Takeshita SexyDynamite.JPG|thumb|Sexy Dynamite and more, at Takeshita-d\\u014dri]]\\n[[File:OmotesandoHills Outside.JPG|thumb|Omotesando Hills, upscale shopping on Omote-sand\\u014d]]\\n\\nHarajuku has two major shopping streets, which couldn't be more different to each other: ''Takeshita-d\\u014dri'' and ''Omote-sand\\u014d''.\\n\\nThe {{marker |type=buy | name=Takeshita-d\\u014dri | lat=35.67142 | long=139.70375}} (\\u7af9\\u4e0b\\u901a\\u308a) targets teens and preteens.

The city is west of Tokyo's 23 downtown wards, bordering on [[Kanagawa]]. Machida City has relatively more nature than any other city in Tokyo. The town has been the setting for many manga and video games.\\n[[File:Buaiso stone pavement.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Buaiso]]\\n==Understand==\\nIt is the third most populous city in Tokyo. Machida is a city with a city and nature. The area in front of Machida station is busy with department stores and shopping areas, but away from the station you will find quiet residential areas, greenery and parks. Minami-Machida has been redeveloped with commercial facilities and a park at [https://gbp.minamimachida-grandberrypark.com/ Grandberry Park] (\\u30b0\\u30e9\\u30f3\\u30d9\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30d1\\u30fc\\u30af). In front of Machida, you will find a variety of shops and brands, and almost everything you need is available. Once you've done the necessary shopping, you can relax in the park.\\n\\nSatoshi Tajiri, the creator of Pok\\u00e9mon, spent his childhood in this town, and Tajiri says that his experience of playing in the nature of Machida, where he was called \\\"Dr. Insect\\\", has been used in creating Pok\\u00e9mon. A Pok\\u00e9mon manhole has been set up in Serigaya Park near the house where Tajiri lived. It is also the town where the raccoon dog (Tanuki) moves to in the last scene of the Studio Ghibli movie Pom Poko.\\n\\n===History===\\nMachida has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The oldest stone tool found in Machida City is about 23,000 years old. Around 16,500-2,800 years ago (Jomon period), people built settlements. A reproduction of a house from those days stands in the Honmachida Ruins Park (\\u672c\\u753a\\u7530\\u907a\\u8de1\\u516c\\u5712).\\n\\nThe Kamakura-kaido road runs through the city. This road network connected [[Kamakura]], the capital of the 12th century, with various places. As a stopping point for the road, a post town was established in Machida and prospered. It is said that there was a castle built in those days, but it has been replaced by a temple and a park. The Ruins of Idesawa Castle and the Ruins of Idesawa Battlefield are the Sugawara Shrine (\\u83c5\\u539f\\u795e\\u793e).\\n\\nIt also became prosperous as a transit point for the \\\"Silk Road\\\" that brought silk produced in [[Hachioji]] to [[Yokohama]] in the late 17th century. There are many old establishments with a long history. Established in 1884, Kakishimaya (\\u67ff\\u5cf6\\u5c4b), which supported \\\"Silk Road\\\" from long ago as a horse broker. Established in 1895, Masaya Shoten (\\u67fe\\u5c4b\\u5546\\u5e97), Machida's oldest dry goods store. Established in 1919, Tomisawa Shoten (\\u5bcc\\u6fa4\\u5546\\u5e97), which mainly deals in confectionery materials. Established in 1787, Oka Naozaburo Store (\\u5ca1\\u76f4\\u4e09\\u90ce\\u5546\\u5e97), a soy sauce brewer and distributor.\\n\\nDuring the war of the 20th century, Machida was spared from the fires of war, and the post-war reconstruction of the city prospered quickly. The Machida Nakamise shopping street (\\u753a\\u7530\\u4ef2\\u898b\\u4e16\\u5546\\u5e97\\u8857), which evolved from the post-war black market, retains the atmosphere of the 20th century.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n*Average spring temperatures are highs of 15-25&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 4-17&nbsp;\\u00b0C. There is a rainy season around June, when spring turns to summer.\\n*Average summer temperatures are highs of 25-33&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 20-23&nbsp;\\u00b0C, which is 1 to 2 degrees cooler than in the center of Tokyo. It's hot and humid, but the wind feels cooler than in the city center because of the many green areas. Be careful of sudden showers in summer.\\n*Average autumn temperatures are highs of 17-22&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 7-15&nbsp;\\u00b0C. There is a rainy season around September, when autumn turns to winter.\\n*Average winter temperatures are highs of 10-15&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of minus 2-5&nbsp;\\u00b0C. It can snow enough to accumulate for a day or two.\\n\\n===Tourist information site===\\nThe local tourist association has a [https://machida-guide.or.jp/ multilingual guide site].\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By train===\\nMachida is a major stop on the ''Odakyu Line'' from [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]], and the ''JR Yokohama Line'' between [[Yokohama]] and [[Hachioji]].\\n\\nNearly all Odakyu trains out of Shinjuku stop at Machida. The fastest ways to reach Machida from Shinjuku are by the Odakyu Rapid Express (\\u5feb\\u901f\\u6025\\u884c, marked with orange text) and Express trains (\\u6025\\u884c, written in red text). These trains depart frequently, every 10 minutes or less, and reach Machida from Shinjuku in about 29 to 35 minutes (\\u00a5360). Slower Semi-Express (\\u6e96\\u6025) or local trains can take about 45 to 55 minutes. Machida is also the first stop on all Limited Express services that run to Hakone. They take about the same time as a Rapid Express, but incur an additional \\u00a5400 surcharge. However, for that price you get your own comfortable seat, similar to those on a bullet train, so reserving a seat on this train especially during rush hour can make your ride a lot more pleasant.\\n\\nJR Yokohama Line trains make runs to Machida from Hachioji (20\\u201330 minutes, \\u00a5290) and Yokohama (30\\u201340 minutes, \\u00a5380). More frequent trains from Yokohama depart from nearby Higashi-Kanagawa (\\u6771\\u795e\\u5948\\u5ddd) station.\\n\\nThe Yokohama Line offers the best connection from the Tokaido Shinkansen to Machida via Shin-Yokohama station (15\\u201320 minutes, \\u00a5290).\\n\\nThere is no charge for JR trains with the '''Japan Rail Pass'''.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nKanachu and Keio bus companies jointly offer daily services to Machida from Narita and Haneda airports. (There is only one service, depending on the time of the day, you may get Kanachu or Keio service.)\\n==Get around==\\n{{Mapframe|35.542478|139.452153|zoom=12|height=400|width=400|layer=W}}\\n===By train===\\nTrains run on the Odakyu Line, the JR Yokohama Line and the Tokyu Denentoshi Line. The Odakyu Line, Tokyu Denentoshi Line and Kei\\u014d Sagamihara Line run from northeast to southwest along Kanagawa Prefecture, and the JR Yokohama Line runs from southeast to northwest along Kanagawa Prefecture. Trains run along the border of the prefecture, so buses are the main way to get around in Machida. Trains run along the border between prefectures, so buses are the main way to get around inside Machida.\\n*Odakyuu Lune (\\u5c0f\\u7530\\u6025\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Machida Station | alt=\\u753a\\u7530\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.543628 | long=139.444812 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tamagawa Gakuen Station | alt=\\u7389\\u5ddd\\u5b66\\u5712\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.563372 | long=139.463395 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tsurukawa Station | alt=\\u9db4\\u5ddd\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.583197 | long=139.481687 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n*JR Yokohama Line (JR\\u6a2a\\u6d5c\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Naruse Station | alt=\\u6210\\u702c\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.535467 | long=139.472944 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Machida Station | alt=\\u753a\\u7530\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.542003 | long=139.445369 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Kobuchi Station | alt=\\u53e4\\u6df5\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.556009 | long=139.419202 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Fuchinobe Station | alt=\\u6df5\\u91ce\\u8fba\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.568745 | long=139.395119 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Yabe Station | alt=\\u77e2\\u90e8\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.573081 | long=139.386765 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Sagamihara Station | alt=\\u76f8\\u6a21\\u539f\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.581486 | long=139.370726 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Hashimoto Station | alt=\\u6a4b\\u672c\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.594943 | long=139.344972 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Aihara Station | alt=\\u76f8\\u539f\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.606898 | long=139.331665 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n*Tokyu Denentoshi Line (\\u6771\\u6025 \\u7530\\u5712\\u90fd\\u5e02\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Minami-Machida Granberry Park | alt=\\u5357\\u753a\\u7530\\u30b0\\u30e9\\u30f3\\u30d9\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30d1\\u30fc\\u30af\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.511468 | long=139.470655 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Suzukake Dai Station | alt=\\u3059\\u305a\\u304b\\u3051\\u53f0\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.516933 | long=139.481556 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tsukushino Station | alt=\\u3064\\u304f\\u3057\\u91ce\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.527689 | long=139.485080 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n*Kei\\u014d Sagamihara Line (\\u4eac\\u738b \\u76f8\\u6a21\\u539f\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tamasakai Station | alt=\\u591a\\u6469\\u5883\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.601895 | long=139.367303 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===By bus===\\nYou can get to Machida by bus.

The '''Southern Lights''' or '''''aurora australis''''' also occur but are not as often observed.\\n\\nTo observers at far-northern latitudes, the Lights are a frequent occurrence, but many who live in more temperate climates have never seen them, even though they are occasionally seen as far south as 35 degrees North latitude. This article will help you improve your chances of seeing the Lights if you journey north.\\n[[File:Aurora Borealis I.jpg|thumb|400px|Northern Lights near [[Troms\\u00f8]], [[Norway]]]]\\nThe aurorae are caused by charged particles ejected from the sun. When these particles reach the earth, they collide with gas molecules in the earth's upper atmosphere, energising them and creating a spectacular multi-coloured light show. Charged particles are affected by magnetic fields, so the Lights occur mainly at far northern or southern latitudes near the Earth's magnetic poles.\\n\\nThe Lights look somewhat similar to a sunset in the sky at night, but appear occasionally in arcs or spirals usually following the earth's magnetic field. They fairly often look like moving curtains of light, high in the sky. They are most often light green in color but often have a hint of pink. Strong eruptions also have violet and white colors. Red northern lights are rare, but are sometimes observed.\\n\\nThe Lights are generally fairly dim, but sometimes bright enough that reading a newspaper on a moonless night is possible. Both brightness and how far from the poles they are visible vary according to three factors: time of year, an 11-year cycle in solar activity, and solar storms. These are discussed in more detail later.\\n\\nLight pollution around cities can mask a dim aurora display. Therefore, areas at least 30 km from cities are preferred for viewing. The trick is to get far enough from cities for good viewing (generally easy, since most northern areas are not heavily populated) ''without'' taking undue risks in a climate that can easily kill you.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Map auroral oval mostly canada.png|thumb|200px|Northern Lights oval, 2007]]\\n\\nContrary to intuition, seeing the Northern Lights isn't just a matter of heading north. The Lights occur mainly in a circular or elliptical band centered on the earth's North ''Magnetic'' Pole, which is not at the same location as the [[North Pole | North ''Geographic'' Pole]].\\n\\nThe exact location of the North Magnetic Pole varies. Until early in this century, the pole was moving slowly (about 10 km/year) north across [[Ellesmere Island]] in the nearly uninhabited far north of [[Canada]]. Since the beginning  of the  21st century, the pole has been moving faster, for reasons scientists are not yet certain of. As of late 2019 it is out in the Arctic Ocean well north of Ellesmere, and moving toward Russia at about 55 km/year. Because of the movement, the advantages of being on the \\\"right side\\\" of the earth are becoming less pronounced, but there is still a slight North American bias in your chance of seeing the Lights.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|thumb|200px|Southern Lights seen from space]]\\n\\nAuroral displays aren't strongest ''at'' the pole; the band of greatest activity is offset from the Magnetic Pole by 20 degrees or so; the magnetic lines of force are curved and the curvature creates the offset. The '''Northern Lights oval''', meaning the area with the highest probability of seeing the Lights, covers most of [[Alaska]], northern parts of [[Canada]], the southern half of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], northern [[Norway]] and the northernmost areas of [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], as well as the western half of the Russian north. There is a similar oval in the South; see the photo.\\n\\nRegions such as the central and southern parts of the [[Nordic countries]], southern Canada, the north-central [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Scotland]] also frequently see Northern Lights, but not as often as directly under the Northern Lights oval. [[Svalbard]] sees Northern Lights less often than Northern Scandinavia, but is a place to observe the fainter Day Northern Lights visible during waking hours in its long [[polar night]]. \\n\\nThat said, the actual latitudes of the Lights vary considerably. In times of high solar activity (more on that later), the Lights may be seen in North America at latitudes as low as 35 degrees North, meaning that all but the southernmost parts of the United States may get a display. The offset of the Pole keeps solar storms from benefiting Europe quite as strongly, but most of the countries of northern Europe will get displays during periods of solar storms.\\n\\n==Planning==\\nThere is no guarantee of seeing the Northern Lights even if you are in the best areas at the best time, and there is some chance in others areas and seasons. However, a bit of planning will radically increase your chances. In short, pick somewhere on or very near the oval and go in winter.\\n\\n===Time of year===\\n[[File:AuroraBuryatia.jpg|thumb|400px|Lights in Scandinavia]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\nDarkness is required. Most Northern Lights locations are at high latitudes, in areas that get the \\\"[[midnight sun]]\\\"; there is no darkness from late April until mid-August, or even longer in far northern locations like [[Svalbard]]. Places within eight degrees of latitude south of the Arctic Circle, such as [[Yellowknife]] in Canada, experience \\\"white nights\\\", with only a few hours of twilight between dusk and dawn, at this time of year. In this period, no Northern Lights can be observed.\\n\\nIn the most intense Northern Lights areas, right on the oval, the lights are sometimes observed in any season but chances are best when it is dark after 6pm, from late September to late March. \\n\\nOn a yearly basis, the Lights are at their peak around the time of the equinoxes, in September and March.  The reasons for this trend aren't fully known, but it's definitely real, not just an artifact of the weather or other viewing conditions. Also, if you are planning to do other activities during the day, this is a good time to visit because you can enjoy twelve hours of daylight and still have a good chance of seeing the aurora at night. Temperatures are also milder than in mid-winter.\\n\\n===Time of day===\\nThe time between 6PM and 1AM is the most intense period of the day. The highest probability within this timespan is between 10 and 11PM. However, this is a guideline, and during the Polar night aurorae can be observed as early as 4PM, and all through the night. The most intense displays last some 5\\u201315 minutes each. In periods of strong activity, one can generally expect flares starting in the early evening, peaking around 10pm, and going on into the early morning hours.\\n\\nEven with good clothing, few travellers can tolerate a long time outdoors in an arctic night and the nights generally get continuously colder from sunset until the morning sun starts to warm things up. Even if there are lights in the early evening, it may be best to set out at 9pm or so (sun time, check your timezone); this gives you a good chance of catching the peak display without being out too long or at the coldest times.\\n\\n===11-year cycle===\\nIn the longer term, auroral displays are correlated with an 11-year cycle in sunspot activity and other perturbations of the sun; the more restless the sun, the more aurorae. However, at the most favorable latitudes, the Lights are still likely to be seen even at solar minimum; it's mainly at lower latitudes that they get scarce during the inactive times. There is a maximum in solar activity around 2024.\\n\\n===Solar storms===\\nIn addition to these more or less regular variations in frequency of the aurora, there are also less predictable, erratic displays resulting from '''solar storms'''.  Some of these, particularly near solar-activity maximum, can lead to visible Northern Lights remarkably far south, if you're in an area with clear, transparent night skies. The largest recorded solar storm took place in 1859; the Lights were bright enough to read a newspaper in [[Boston]] (42\\u00b0N) and visible as far south as Mexico. That storm was powerful enough that telegraphs would work without their normal power source, some caught fire. A similar one would probably destroy most electronics.\\n\\nThe [[#Alerts|Alerts]] section below will help you stay on top of solar activity and prepare for some viewing when a solar storm does occur.\\n\\n===Clear skies===\\nLast but not least, don't forget the '''weather forecast''' &mdash; aurora occur very high up in the atmosphere, and if there are clouds in the way you will not see anything. In Northern Scandinavia, the weather is notably better towards the end of the Northern Lights season (February-March), than in the beginning. The weather is probably the most important success factor in the areas under the Northern Lights oval, where there are visible Northern Lights on up to 80% of all clear nights.\\n\\n==Prepare==\\n\\n===Alerts===\\nIf you have the luxury of being able to travel into aurora-viewing territory on short notice, you can improve your chances of seeing something by being aware of \\\"space weather,\\\" the things going on beyond the earth's atmosphere as a result of solar activity.\\n[[File:Aurora australis ISS 20120715.jpg|thumb|400px|Southern Lights seen from the International Space Station, with the Canadarm robotic arm in the foreground]]\\nA good site for space weather information is operated by the (US) [http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] (NOAA). Measurements aboard the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite are used for plotting maps of current extent and position of the auroral oval around both poles; see their [https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast forecast] which predicts intensity and geographical location of the auroral oval based on current solar wind conditions and interplanetary magnetic field virtually in real time. The maps also show the observation limits of current aurorae. The commercial site [http://www.spaceweather.com/ Space Weather] presents much of the same information in digested, more accessible form.\\n\\nThe University of Alaska Fairbanks maintains an [http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast Aurora Alert] website. For Finland, the Finnish Meteorological Institute has an [http://aurorasnow.fmi.fi/public_service/ activity forecast] and current data about magnetic activity. The Icelandic MET office provides a [http://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/ lights forecast] for Iceland including cloud cover prediction.\\n\\nActivity is mainly predicted from the readings taken by the NASA Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellites, which give a one-hour warning. Solar wind activity is characterized by three principal figures: the north-south component of the magnetic field (Bz), speed and density. When Bz is negative (southward), solar wind particles are best able to enter the atmosphere and give rise to aurorae. At high velocities, auroral activity may occur despite a moderately negative Bz. In geomagnetic storms, Bz fluctuates rapidly. Overall geomagnetic activity is characterized by the planetary K-index (Kp), for which predictions are issued. A Kp of 5 or higher occurs in storms and generally makes auroral viewing possible well South of the oval in the northern parts of Europe and the [[United States of America|continental U.S.]]\\n\\nLonger-term estimates can be made by observation of the Sun for bursts. However, the physical models are poorly developed, partly because only two satellites, ACE and DSCOVR, observe the solar wind before it hits the Earth, and the predictions are rather unreliable. The approximate day can be predicted, but whether the burst hits the Earth face-on and exactly when and at what force remains unknown. \\\"Nowcasting\\\" on the ground is done by measuring magnetic field fluctuations, and there are webcams pointed at the sky for directly seeing the aurorae. The NASA Polar and Environmental Satellites (POES) directly measure the extent of the auroral oval, but the satellites pass the pole about 14 times a day and thus the picture can be couple of hours old.\\n\\nIf a major solar storm develops that is forecast to have a good chance of producing Northern (and Southern) Lights, your time to respond will be measured in hours to a few days, rather than either minutes or weeks. The particles that create the aurora move much more slowly than light, so a storm can be observed well before the particles it produces reach Earth, but the time difference is not enormous. The forecasts will usually include some indication of how far from the magnetic poles the activity is expected to extend.  For purposes of travel planning, it's a good idea to plan conservatively and go to a locale somewhat closer to the pole than the predicted maximum extent of the aurora; things don't always work out as forecast, and the Lights may be relatively weak and/or confined to the northern horizon if you're at the southern edge of the activity, either limitation possibly creating difficulties for you in viewing owing to light pollution.\\n\\n===Clothing===\\n[[File:St\\u00f8rmer and Birkeland Alta 1910.jpg|thumb|400px|Freezing photographers, Norway, 1910]]\\nBecause aurorae are usually visible at night in the colder months of the year, the observers tend to spend long hours in cold darkness. It is essential to  dress adequately to minimize the unpleasant side of the auroral experience, and almost impossible to dress too warmly.\\n\\nIn any area that gets severe winters, winter clothing will be widely available, but specialist shops catering to [[Skiing|skiers]], [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] or [[Wilderness backpacking|wilderness backpackers]] generally offer the best choice. Further south, these specialists may be the only places with winter equipment.\\n\\nIn remote northern locations where food, fuel and equipment have to be shipped in, ''prices on more-or-less everything can be very high''. Major northern cities tend to have better prices than more isolated areas, but still higher than in areas further south. Most travellers should buy much of their equipment before setting out; this gives more time for shopping, saves money, and avoids arriving in summer clothing when it is seriously cold outside.\\n\\nSome travellers should plan an extra stop for shopping; for example, going from Miami (where good winter gear is likely to be hard to find) to view the Lights in [[Churchill]] (where it is likely to be expensive and selection limited), one might stop in [[Chicago]], [[Toronto]] or [[Winnipeg]] to outfit oneself.\\n\\nFor specific information on winter clothing, see [[Cold weather#Clothing|Cold weather]]. Remember that you will have to use your fingers, so a combination of gloves and mittens can be useful.\\n\\n===Photography===\\n\\nTaking good pictures of the Northern Lights is '''very difficult''', since they're fast-moving, often faint and against a pitch-dark background, all of which befuddles consumer point-and-shoot cameras. Almost any [[Travel photography/Full systems|interchangeable lens camera]] can handle the job, given the right lens, but the typical \\\"kit lens\\\" sold with them will almost certainly not be fast enough and may not be wide enough either.\\n{{infobox|Lens focal lengths|In discussing focal length, we assume a 35mm film camera or \\\"full frame\\\" digital camera. For other types of camera, the actual numbers are different but the \\\"35mm equivalent\\\" is often quoted.}}\\nLong exposures are often required to capture faint lights. Here's what you need for a sporting chance:\\n\\n* A camera that supports '''manual exposure''' (5 to 40 seconds)\\n* A '''fast lens''' (aperture f/2.8 or better). Typically, a [[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|wide-angle lens]] is used to get a large area of sky.\\n* '''Fast film''' (800 ASA or better), or equivalent ISO setting on a digital camera\\n* A '''tripod''' to hold the long exposure\\n* '''Cable release or self-timer''' to trigger shots without stirring the camera\\n: Even better, for some cameras a '''remote control''' is available. Some cameras can use a wireless '''smartphone connection''' as remote control, but few smartphones are made for the conditions.\\n* '''Manual focus'''. It is not recommended to just focus your lens to infinity, instead it is best done by aiming at the Moon or a bright star (ideally in the live-view mode and using the maximum zoom).\\n* Multiple '''spare batteries and memory cards''': only having them will ensure they won't be needed. Keep the spares warm.\\n* What you don't need is the lens '''filter''': it can cause interference, so better take it off your lens.\\n[[File:Aurora shapes.jpg|thumb|405x405px|Images with Canon EOS 400D, ISO 1600, f/2.8, exposure 4s\\u201330s, 17mm (24 full frame).]]\\nWith a digital camera shooting in RAW format (or at least JPG + RAW) is a good idea: if something goes wrong in the field, there is more space for corrections in post-processing that way.\\n\\nAvoid breathing on the lens, the viewer or the display to prevent frosting them up. A light source such as a flashlight or headlamp can be useful when setting up the camera and tripod, and a smartphone is handy for alerts and forecasts. However, you need to get your eyes adjusted to darkness, so it is a good idea to limit use of these and set both phone and camera LCD displays to minimum brightness.\\n\\nThe ideal location has no light pollution, offers some shelter against wind, and is easily accessible. On a cold arctic night, you definitely want to avoid lugging camera and tripod a long distance or standing around in windy conditions waiting for the right shot. Moreover, wind tends to shake the camera, which is a problem in long exposures. A bigger, sturdier tripod helps with that, but is even worse to lug around.  If possible, do some scouting by day so you can go straight to a good location at night. It is not always possible to find a great location, but even a reasonable one can give better photos with less discomfort.\\n\\nAlso, try to get something interesting in the foreground; the [[#Europe|Norwegian photo below]] is a fine example. A shot of just the sky and some snow can be a bit boring even if the Lights are good.\\n\\nEither a zoom (variable focal length) or a prime (single focal length) lens can be used; each type has advantages. Zoom lenses are more flexible; you can adjust quickly for different sizes of light display. Primes are generally significantly faster than zooms, lighter and more compact; in many cases they also give a sharper picture than a zoom lens set to the same focal length.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora borealis over Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska.jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora borealis in [[Alaska]]]]<!-- image referenced in the text, check if you move or exchange it -->\\n\\n[[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|Wide-angle lenses]] are the commonest choice for photographing the lights. They give some distortion, even producing \\\"fish-eye\\\" images in extreme cases. The photo to the right was taken with a 16mm lens; the horizon appears curved and the trees in the foreground appear slightly off vertical, but some viewers would not notice this distortion and few would find it bothersome. The [[#Time_of_year|Scandinavian photo above]] used an even wider lens and has more distortion. A slightly longer lens, perhaps 24mm, would reduce the distortion but cover less of the sky. This is where zoom lenses have a significant advantage over primes; with, say, a 16\\u201335mm zoom you can adjust each shot to get the best trade-off between distortion and coverage. In other conditions, you might carry several primes and adjust by swapping lenses, but this is remarkably inconvenient in the field in an arctic night.\\n\\nA faster lens or a high-ISO camera setting can reduce exposure time, which is good. The photo to the right used an F2.8 lens and 25-second exposure. With F4, it would need 50 seconds, at or perhaps beyond the upper limit for practical shooting. An F1.4 lens would cut the time to around six seconds. This is quite likely to give a sharper photo because the lights move less during exposure, and it allows a bit more control over the shot; if you hit the shutter release when the sky looks particularly interesting, it is more likely to stay that way for a few seconds than over a longer time. This is where prime lenses have an advantage; they are often quite a bit faster than zooms. \\n\\nCombine a fast lens with a camera that allows high ISO settings and you might get exposure time down under a second, but it is not certain that this would give a better photo. High ISO settings give more noise in the image and you might lose more from that than you gain from the shorter time.\\n\\nFast wide lenses are expensive. Checking full-frame Canon lenses on an American vendor's site mid-2013, the cheapest lenses that might be suitable for shooting the Lights are a 40mm F2.8 at about $150 or 35/2.0 near $300; those are not wide enough to be ideal, but they would be usable and anything better is more expensive. More typical choices &mdash; for someone with a nice lens collection in hand or a good budget for building one &mdash; would be 20 or 24mm F2.8, 28/1.8, or the 17\\u201340 F4 zoom, in the $450 to $750 price range. The ideal choice might be either a 24/1.4 prime or 16\\u201335 F2.8 zoom, but these are high-end products mainly for professional photographers; either is around $1500. An ultra-wide 14mm F2.8 is a very good choice, and while those with auto-focus cost over $2000, some manual focus versions are available for a significantly lower price. Other brands have a different set of products and prices, but the overall pattern is similar. Companies other than the camera manufacturers also offer lenses, but again the pattern is similar.\\n\\nSee [[travel photography]] for more general discussion.\\n\\n==Locations==\\n[[File:Rovaniemi - Aurora Borealis.jpg|thumb|Aurora in [[Rovaniemi]], [[Finland]]]]\\nNorthern Lights usually form about 100 km (60 miles) above the surface of the earth. In principle, all areas under the Northern Lights oval are good observation points. However, most of these areas are remote and inaccessible, and suffer harsh climatic conditions.\\n\\nWhen selecting an observation site:\\n* If using a car, stay close to it. A typical car heater cannot actually keep a large metal vehicle warm when it is well below zero outside, but it is better than nothing and a car does provide shelter against wind. In really cold weather, leave the engine running even when you are away from the car, since the engine may have trouble starting again.\\n* Try finding accommodation in an area known to be good for viewing the Northern Lights. This may include a cottage, wilderness hut, a heated tent or similar shelter. This avoids long drives late at night to get to and from the viewing area.\\n* Avoid locations with light pollution; try to get away from populated areas. If this is not possible, try to have at least the northern view free of light pollution.\\n* Avoid steep hillsides or other major obstacles to the north.\\n\\nConsider bringing a tent or just a portable windbreak to provide some shelter from wind. Also vacuum flasks for hot beverages.\\n\\nViewing or photographing the Lights is an activity where hiring a local guide or paying for a tour is often worthwhile. A guide's local knowledge can help in several areas: coping with the weather, finding good sites, choosing good routes, and avoiding close encounters with [[dangerous wildlife]] such as polar bears or musk oxen. Also, a guide or tour company will have vehicles and other equipment suitable for the conditions. In remote areas it may not be possible to rent a vehicle or bring your own and, even if it is possible, it is not advisable unless both vehicle and driver are well prepared for [[winter driving]]. Some tours offer unusual transport options such as snowmobiles or sleds pulled by dogs, reindeer or horses; few tourists could safely drive those, and no owner of valuable animals is likely to allow a visitor to handle them unsupervised.\\n\\nVarious locations provide some kind of infrastructure, like tours, observation points etc. Here are lists of some major ones, in approximately west-to-east order:\\n\\n===North America===\\n{{seealso|Winter in North America}}\\n[[File:Flickr - DVIDSHUB - Alaska Aurora Borealis (Image 1 of 2).jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora in [[Alaska]]]]\\n*[[Fairbanks]], Alaska: famous for aurora viewing, with many tours and sites that cater to aurora watchers.\\n*[[Yellowknife]], in Canada's Northwest Territories, also with many tours\\n*[[Churchill]], on Hudson's Bay in Manitoba, is right smack dab in the center of the auroral belt, and offers the opportunity to see (lots of) polar bears on the same trip.\\n*[[Isle Royale National Park]], Upper Michigan, is a leave-no-trace park with no tours and few facilities. This is the best place in the 48 contiguous US sates to see the lights because it is quite far north and there is no light pollution.\\n\\n===North Atlantic islands===\\n\\n*[[Kangerlussuaq]], Greenland: very high chance of seeing the Lights from November to March. If dogsled or snowmobile rides are desired, mid-late winter is recommended.\\n*[[M\\u00fdvatn]], Iceland: offers the unique experience of observing aurorae while soaking in a natural geothermal bath. The capital, [[Reykjavik]], serves as a base for many tours.\\n*[[Berneray]], Outer Hebrides: this remote Scottish island offers suitable conditions for northern lights observation due to low light pollution.\\n\\n===Europe===\\n[[File:Aurora over Haja-3,2.jpg|thumb|Near Troms\\u00f8\\u200e, Norway]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\n{{Seealso|Winter in the Nordic countries}}\\n\\n* [[Abisko]], Northern Sweden. A popular place where the northern lights can be watched from the Aurora Sky Station at the top of the mountain Nuolja.\\n* [[Troms\\u00f8]], Northern Norway, is an easily accessible location with mild weather and numerous excursions. However the coastal location makes it susceptible to overcast conditions. Nearby [[Skibotn]] enjoys a dryer climate (very dry for Norway); this makes for better viewing opportunities. Another nearby location is [[Senja]] island.\\n* [[Alta]], also in Norway but further to the north-east and known for prehistoric rock carvings, is marketed also as a place to watch northern lights.\\n* [[Jukkasj\\u00e4rvi]], Northern Sweden, is the site of the original Ice Hotel, with excellent viewing infrastructure.\\n* [[Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi]], [[Inari]] and [[Utsjoki]] in Finnish Lapland all have quite dry weather and little light pollution.<!-- Nellim is another village which is far from light pollution. Add when there is an article.--> The ski resorts [[Saariselk\\u00e4]] in Inari and [[Levi]] in Kittil\\u00e4 have accommodation in glass igloos specially designed for enjoying the northern lights.\\n* The Kola Peninsula of [[Murmansk Oblast]] is Russia's most popular viewing spot.\\n\\nThe likelihood of seeing aurorae rapidly decreases when going south. In [[Helsinki]], aurorae occur about once a month, and are usually masked by light pollution or clouds. Aurorae seen further outside of the auroral belts may also be much less vivid, with fewer colours.\\n\\n=== Cruise ships ===\\nA luxurious way to see the lights is to take a [[cruise ship]] along the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Alaska]], or toward [[Antarctica]] for the Southern Lights, in the appropriate season. Cruises tend to be expensive, but the costs may be quite reasonable compared to flying to a good site on land and paying for accommodation and tours there. Viewing the Lights by just strolling on deck after dinner is much more convenient than being driven somewhere to stand in the snow, and the chance of encounters with dangerous wildlife is lower. \\n\\nThere may be problems with this; not all cruise lines run in winter and it is ''extremely'' difficult to get good photos from a moving ship when the subject requires long exposures, as the lights generally do. If the cruise is not specially for aurora viewing, chances are that light pollution from the ship itself is an issue.\\n\\n=== In flight ===\\nMany travelers in the northern latitudes find themselves treated to an aerial view of the lights. It's probably not realistic to ''plan'' to see them while on a plane, but if you find yourself taking frequent flights in upper latitudes, consider opting for a window seat on the northern side of the plane. If the show is good enough, the captain will usually make an announcement.\\n\\nIf you thought cruises on the seas were expensive, you probably won't be interested in heading up into '''[[space]]''', but orbital flight at around $35 million/person is a pretty surefire way to see the lights, both Northern and Southern, with zero light interference, and quite a grand view!\\n\\n== The ''Southern'' Lights ==\\n[[File:Aurora Australis Over the Tasman Sea from SouthWest National Park.jpg|thumb|Aurora Australis as seen at the remote New Harbour Beach in Tasmania's Southwest National Park]]\\nAurorae happen in an oval about the South Magnetic Pole just as they do about the North one, and the South Magnetic Pole is similarly offset from the geographic [[South Pole]]. Would-be observers of the '''Southern Lights''' or '''''Aurora Australis''''' benefit from the happy accident that the offset of the South Magnetic Pole is generally in the direction of [[Australia]], although the Pole itself is still in [[Antarctica]] like the geographic one. The southern parts of Australia and [[New Zealand]] get more than their share of Lights relative to their latitude.\\n\\nIn particular, [[Tasmania]] and the [[South Island]] of New Zealand are places where the Lights can be observed several times a year. If conditions are right, [[Hobart]] and [[Invercargill]] offer the best chance in places that are quickly accessible from within Australia and New Zealand.  Although [[Christchurch]] has a geographic latitude south of [[Hobart]], its \\\"geomagnetic latitude\\\" is further north, and aurora there are no more likely than southern [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. Check the space weather while you are travelling.\\n[[File:AuroraAustralisDisplay.jpg|thumb|Southern Lights seen from [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]]]\\n\\nAll these locations are still outside the auroral belt itself, so the odds of catching the lights during your trip there are not good. Because of the skew towards the Eastern Hemisphere, it is not reasonable to expect any viewing from [[Patagonia]], and it's not that likely you'll see them even from the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The best place to view them would be Antarctica's [[Ross Sea]] via [[Macquarie Island]] (Australia) or the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]]. The best viewing would be from the boat itself. The closest island to the auroral belt that has a good range of tourist accommodation is [[Stewart Island]]. \\n\\nThere is day trip flight from [[Sydney]] to see the Southern Lights (A$1,295+).\\n\\nAll of the considerations about maximizing your chances of seeing the Northern Lights apply equally to seeing the Southern Lights, except that the Southern Hemisphere seasons should be taken into account in regards to maximizing the hours of darkness.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Astronomy]]\\n* [[Midnight sun]] \\u2014 at latitudes where there's dark all day in the winter and people travel to see the Northern Lights, there's usually light all night in the summer.\\n{{PartOfTopic|Natural attractions|the Arctic}}\\n{{guidetopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner | Skibotn banner aquaculture.jpg|caption=A view to Storfjorden and mountains around from a quay at Skibotn}}\\n[[Image:Skibotn view towards Roykeneset.JPG|thumb|300px|View towards R\\u00f8ykeneset isthmus]]\\n'''Skibotn''' (Northern Sami: ''Ivgubahta'', Kven/Finnish: ''Markkina'' or ''Yyke\\u00e4nper\\u00e4'') is a village in [[Troms]].

It's too cold here for most leafy trees, so spruces, pine and larch dominate (varying between regions).  It's so cold that the fire season is short, and fires are spaced many years apart, giving trees time to compete with grasses.\\n\\nWater evaporates slowly here, and tends to collect from year to year in every available depression.  There are literally millions of lakes across the subarctic.\\n\\nSoils are generally poor and the growing season is short, so agriculture is limited but does thrive in small belts.  The main lifestyles of most peoples indigenous to this region are hunting, trapping, gathering, and fishing.  Forestry has been important for the last centuries in some regions \\u2013 and in recent decades mining and hydroelectricity generation have spread to many previously roadless locations.\\n\\nSome parts of the world that were once part of this vast forest have been almost completely deforested in recorded history, so the descriptions above no longer seem to fit, but are included on the map to the right.  This applies to much of [[Scotland]] and [[Iceland]].\\n\\n==Get in==\\nRoad connections are almost entirely from the south.  As a general rule, the further north one goes, the more one relies on air and sea travel to get to the region. [[General aviation#Bush planes|Bush planes]] are quite common in Alaska and Northern Canada. In the boreal parts of the [[Nordic countries]], the road and rail connections are mostly good, with buses at least along the highways (and old steamers cruising with tourists in the [[Finnish Lakeland]]).\\n\\n==Get around==\\n===By car===\\n{{see also|Winter driving}}\\n{{see also|Driving in Canada|Driving in Finland|Driving in Iceland|Driving in Russia|Driving in Sweden|Driving in the United States}}\\n\\nIf one happens to be travelling by road, planning the route is crucial, as it is often hundreds of km between fuel and food stops.\\n\\nIn this part of the world, it's also not uncommon to travel by [[Canoeing|canoe]], [[Winter sports|dog sled, snowshoe, or cross-country skis.]]  While hiking in the wilderness is one of the best reasons to come here, it will often be near a city or highway.  As anywhere, hiking farther in the wilderness requires planning and experience, but in the [[Hiking in the Nordic countries|Nordic countries]] it is easy to access routes with few people and seemingly untouched nature, but still find huts or lodges for most nights.\\n\\n==See==\\n[[File:Aurora borealis over Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska.jpg|thumb|Northern lights]]\\nWatch the [[northern lights]] (''aurora borealis'') dance in the sky on a dark evening.

From [[Nordland]] of Norway, drive to Sweden by E10 and use E45, from [[Troms]], use E8, from western [[Finnmark]], use E45, and from eastern Finnmark either drive to E45 (along E6 or via [[Karigasniemi]]) or via [[Inari]] and Sirkka of Kittil\\u00e4.\\n\\nTrains go to Kolari in season. At other times you have to go to [[Oulu]], [[Kemi]] or [[Rovaniemi]] and continue by other means. The Swedish trains take you to [[Lule\\u00e5]] or [[Haparanda]].\\n\\nThere are daily coaches along E8 between Rovaniemi and Troms, skipping the Norwegian leg off season (in spring and autumn).\\n\\nThere are airports in Kittil\\u00e4 and Hetta, the latter without scheduled services.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nThe daily or twice-daily coaches from Rovaniemi via Kittil\\u00e4, Levi and Muonio to Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi are the main transport unless you have a car. It should be possible to transfer for Hetta at Palojoensuu, where E45 leaves E8 for Hetta, Kivilompolo and Kautokeino (where the coaches might continue). For getting to your destination in the region, airport transfers can be booked.\\n\\nThere are weekly bookable shared taxis (mainly for the elderly etc.) on some routes. Normal taxis are also available.\\n\\nThere is a decent road network between the major villages and to trailheads for hikes. The E8 passes the highest point of the Finnish public road network close to Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi \\u2013 check weather forecasts.\\n\\nFor wilderness destinations, use your feet (or a bike) in summer, skis or perhaps a snowmobile in winter.

For a one-week canoe adventure, try paddling down the border from near the tripoint to the sea.\\n\\nFishing is big in some of the lakes and along the main rivers, and you'll find tourist businesses arranging fishing trips more or less anywhere. Going independently, you have to check rules and pay the fees.\\n\\nSome natural sights are in easy reach. Check the national park visitor centres and their surroundings. At Iitto, along the road to Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi, there is a palsa bog, probably the most easily reached one of these, otherwise characteristic for the tundra. Near Karesuvanto along the same road there is an observation tower of the L\\u00e4t\\u00e4seno-Hietajoki mire protection area. Most significant villages have some short hiking trails to nearby sights. And at any cottage you have access to some of the local nature.\\n\\nThe E8 is called the \\\"Aurora Borealis Route\\\" by some and, indeed, this may be a good region for spotting [[northern lights]] in the dark season: little light pollution, often clear skies and more or less the right latitudes. In midwinter you also have polar night \\u2013 no sun to be seen, just a bit of twilight in midday. Most would prefer the [[midnight sun]], which can be seen much of the summer, depending on where you stay.\\n\\nFor [[Sami culture]], you may want to check Hetta at a suitable festival. The national park visitor centre has relevant exhibitions year round. With the right attitude or the right contacts you could also trek to a S\\u00e1mi summer camp off roads \\u2013 but remember their right to private life: be a guest they appreciate. An easier way might be to find a local S\\u00e1mi craftsperson and chat while buying some of their textiles or jewellery. Don't go to the booths lined with \\\"Sami\\\" costumes for sale \\u2013 that's likely a Finn selling fake.\\n\\n===Itineraries===\\n* [[E8 through Finland and Norway]]\\n* [[E45 through Europe]]\\n* [[Nordkalottleden]]\\n* [[Stuorrahanoaivi trek]]\\n\\n==Eat==\\n\\n==Drink==\\nFor nightlife, head for the ski resorts.\\n\\nGood-looking running water in the wild is usually potable.

However, the main option is a [[Finland#Cabins|cottage]]. These are common at the resorts, and you will find them here and there, mostly along the rivers. When booking, check that the cottage is where you want to stay; some search engines may suggest accommodations a few hundred kilometres away.\\n\\nIn the wilderness areas and national park, you often have access to [[Finnish National Parks#Sleep|open wilderness huts]], where you can overnight for free (with your own hiking mattress and sleeping bag). These rely on visitors behaving, service is sometimes done only biennially \\u2013 and latecomers have an absolute right to the facilities, as those who arrived earlier have had time to get warm and dry (and to put up their tent in case). In the national park, there are also similar locked and bookable huts.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nFor trekking, remember that you are in the Arctic. In mountains, what matters is not the height but the treeline.

When these particles reach the earth, they collide with gas molecules in the earth's upper atmosphere, energising them and creating a spectacular multi-coloured light show. Charged particles are affected by magnetic fields, so the Lights occur mainly at far northern or southern latitudes near the Earth's magnetic poles.\\n\\nThe Lights look somewhat similar to a sunset in the sky at night, but appear occasionally in arcs or spirals usually following the earth's magnetic field. They fairly often look like moving curtains of light, high in the sky. They are most often light green in color but often have a hint of pink. Strong eruptions also have violet and white colors. Red northern lights are rare, but are sometimes observed.\\n\\nThe Lights are generally fairly dim, but sometimes bright enough that reading a newspaper on a moonless night is possible. Both brightness and how far from the poles they are visible vary according to three factors: time of year, an 11-year cycle in solar activity, and solar storms. These are discussed in more detail later.\\n\\nLight pollution around cities can mask a dim aurora display. Therefore, areas at least 30 km from cities are preferred for viewing. The trick is to get far enough from cities for good viewing (generally easy, since most northern areas are not heavily populated) ''without'' taking undue risks in a climate that can easily kill you.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Map auroral oval mostly canada.png|thumb|200px|Northern Lights oval, 2007]]\\n\\nContrary to intuition, seeing the Northern Lights isn't just a matter of heading north. The Lights occur mainly in a circular or elliptical band centered on the earth's North ''Magnetic'' Pole, which is not at the same location as the [[North Pole | North ''Geographic'' Pole]].\\n\\nThe exact location of the North Magnetic Pole varies. Until early in this century, the pole was moving slowly (about 10 km/year) north across [[Ellesmere Island]] in the nearly uninhabited far north of [[Canada]]. Since the beginning  of the  21st century, the pole has been moving faster, for reasons scientists are not yet certain of. As of late 2019 it is out in the Arctic Ocean well north of Ellesmere, and moving toward Russia at about 55 km/year. Because of the movement, the advantages of being on the \\\"right side\\\" of the earth are becoming less pronounced, but there is still a slight North American bias in your chance of seeing the Lights.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|thumb|200px|Southern Lights seen from space]]\\n\\nAuroral displays aren't strongest ''at'' the pole; the band of greatest activity is offset from the Magnetic Pole by 20 degrees or so; the magnetic lines of force are curved and the curvature creates the offset. The '''Northern Lights oval''', meaning the area with the highest probability of seeing the Lights, covers most of [[Alaska]], northern parts of [[Canada]], the southern half of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], northern [[Norway]] and the northernmost areas of [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], as well as the western half of the Russian north. There is a similar oval in the South; see the photo.\\n\\nRegions such as the central and southern parts of the [[Nordic countries]], southern Canada, the north-central [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Scotland]] also frequently see Northern Lights, but not as often as directly under the Northern Lights oval. [[Svalbard]] sees Northern Lights less often than Northern Scandinavia, but is a place to observe the fainter Day Northern Lights visible during waking hours in its long [[polar night]]. \\n\\nThat said, the actual latitudes of the Lights vary considerably. In times of high solar activity (more on that later), the Lights may be seen in North America at latitudes as low as 35 degrees North, meaning that all but the southernmost parts of the United States may get a display. The offset of the Pole keeps solar storms from benefiting Europe quite as strongly, but most of the countries of northern Europe will get displays during periods of solar storms.\\n\\n==Planning==\\nThere is no guarantee of seeing the Northern Lights even if you are in the best areas at the best time, and there is some chance in others areas and seasons. However, a bit of planning will radically increase your chances. In short, pick somewhere on or very near the oval and go in winter.\\n\\n===Time of year===\\n[[File:AuroraBuryatia.jpg|thumb|400px|Lights in Scandinavia]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\nDarkness is required. Most Northern Lights locations are at high latitudes, in areas that get the \\\"[[midnight sun]]\\\"; there is no darkness from late April until mid-August, or even longer in far northern locations like [[Svalbard]]. Places within eight degrees of latitude south of the Arctic Circle, such as [[Yellowknife]] in Canada, experience \\\"white nights\\\", with only a few hours of twilight between dusk and dawn, at this time of year. In this period, no Northern Lights can be observed.\\n\\nIn the most intense Northern Lights areas, right on the oval, the lights are sometimes observed in any season but chances are best when it is dark after 6pm, from late September to late March. \\n\\nOn a yearly basis, the Lights are at their peak around the time of the equinoxes, in September and March.  The reasons for this trend aren't fully known, but it's definitely real, not just an artifact of the weather or other viewing conditions. Also, if you are planning to do other activities during the day, this is a good time to visit because you can enjoy twelve hours of daylight and still have a good chance of seeing the aurora at night. Temperatures are also milder than in mid-winter.\\n\\n===Time of day===\\nThe time between 6PM and 1AM is the most intense period of the day. The highest probability within this timespan is between 10 and 11PM. However, this is a guideline, and during the Polar night aurorae can be observed as early as 4PM, and all through the night. The most intense displays last some 5\\u201315 minutes each. In periods of strong activity, one can generally expect flares starting in the early evening, peaking around 10pm, and going on into the early morning hours.\\n\\nEven with good clothing, few travellers can tolerate a long time outdoors in an arctic night and the nights generally get continuously colder from sunset until the morning sun starts to warm things up. Even if there are lights in the early evening, it may be best to set out at 9pm or so (sun time, check your timezone); this gives you a good chance of catching the peak display without being out too long or at the coldest times.\\n\\n===11-year cycle===\\nIn the longer term, auroral displays are correlated with an 11-year cycle in sunspot activity and other perturbations of the sun; the more restless the sun, the more aurorae. However, at the most favorable latitudes, the Lights are still likely to be seen even at solar minimum; it's mainly at lower latitudes that they get scarce during the inactive times. There is a maximum in solar activity around 2024.\\n\\n===Solar storms===\\nIn addition to these more or less regular variations in frequency of the aurora, there are also less predictable, erratic displays resulting from '''solar storms'''.  Some of these, particularly near solar-activity maximum, can lead to visible Northern Lights remarkably far south, if you're in an area with clear, transparent night skies. The largest recorded solar storm took place in 1859; the Lights were bright enough to read a newspaper in [[Boston]] (42\\u00b0N) and visible as far south as Mexico. That storm was powerful enough that telegraphs would work without their normal power source, some caught fire. A similar one would probably destroy most electronics.\\n\\nThe [[#Alerts|Alerts]] section below will help you stay on top of solar activity and prepare for some viewing when a solar storm does occur.\\n\\n===Clear skies===\\nLast but not least, don't forget the '''weather forecast''' &mdash; aurora occur very high up in the atmosphere, and if there are clouds in the way you will not see anything. In Northern Scandinavia, the weather is notably better towards the end of the Northern Lights season (February-March), than in the beginning. The weather is probably the most important success factor in the areas under the Northern Lights oval, where there are visible Northern Lights on up to 80% of all clear nights.\\n\\n==Prepare==\\n\\n===Alerts===\\nIf you have the luxury of being able to travel into aurora-viewing territory on short notice, you can improve your chances of seeing something by being aware of \\\"space weather,\\\" the things going on beyond the earth's atmosphere as a result of solar activity.\\n[[File:Aurora australis ISS 20120715.jpg|thumb|400px|Southern Lights seen from the International Space Station, with the Canadarm robotic arm in the foreground]]\\nA good site for space weather information is operated by the (US) [http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] (NOAA). Measurements aboard the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite are used for plotting maps of current extent and position of the auroral oval around both poles; see their [https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast forecast] which predicts intensity and geographical location of the auroral oval based on current solar wind conditions and interplanetary magnetic field virtually in real time. The maps also show the observation limits of current aurorae. The commercial site [http://www.spaceweather.com/ Space Weather] presents much of the same information in digested, more accessible form.\\n\\nThe University of Alaska Fairbanks maintains an [http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast Aurora Alert] website. For Finland, the Finnish Meteorological Institute has an [http://aurorasnow.fmi.fi/public_service/ activity forecast] and current data about magnetic activity. The Icelandic MET office provides a [http://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/ lights forecast] for Iceland including cloud cover prediction.\\n\\nActivity is mainly predicted from the readings taken by the NASA Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellites, which give a one-hour warning. Solar wind activity is characterized by three principal figures: the north-south component of the magnetic field (Bz), speed and density. When Bz is negative (southward), solar wind particles are best able to enter the atmosphere and give rise to aurorae. At high velocities, auroral activity may occur despite a moderately negative Bz. In geomagnetic storms, Bz fluctuates rapidly. Overall geomagnetic activity is characterized by the planetary K-index (Kp), for which predictions are issued. A Kp of 5 or higher occurs in storms and generally makes auroral viewing possible well South of the oval in the northern parts of Europe and the [[United States of America|continental U.S.]]\\n\\nLonger-term estimates can be made by observation of the Sun for bursts. However, the physical models are poorly developed, partly because only two satellites, ACE and DSCOVR, observe the solar wind before it hits the Earth, and the predictions are rather unreliable. The approximate day can be predicted, but whether the burst hits the Earth face-on and exactly when and at what force remains unknown. \\\"Nowcasting\\\" on the ground is done by measuring magnetic field fluctuations, and there are webcams pointed at the sky for directly seeing the aurorae. The NASA Polar and Environmental Satellites (POES) directly measure the extent of the auroral oval, but the satellites pass the pole about 14 times a day and thus the picture can be couple of hours old.\\n\\nIf a major solar storm develops that is forecast to have a good chance of producing Northern (and Southern) Lights, your time to respond will be measured in hours to a few days, rather than either minutes or weeks. The particles that create the aurora move much more slowly than light, so a storm can be observed well before the particles it produces reach Earth, but the time difference is not enormous. The forecasts will usually include some indication of how far from the magnetic poles the activity is expected to extend.  For purposes of travel planning, it's a good idea to plan conservatively and go to a locale somewhat closer to the pole than the predicted maximum extent of the aurora; things don't always work out as forecast, and the Lights may be relatively weak and/or confined to the northern horizon if you're at the southern edge of the activity, either limitation possibly creating difficulties for you in viewing owing to light pollution.\\n\\n===Clothing===\\n[[File:St\\u00f8rmer and Birkeland Alta 1910.jpg|thumb|400px|Freezing photographers, Norway, 1910]]\\nBecause aurorae are usually visible at night in the colder months of the year, the observers tend to spend long hours in cold darkness. It is essential to  dress adequately to minimize the unpleasant side of the auroral experience, and almost impossible to dress too warmly.\\n\\nIn any area that gets severe winters, winter clothing will be widely available, but specialist shops catering to [[Skiing|skiers]], [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] or [[Wilderness backpacking|wilderness backpackers]] generally offer the best choice. Further south, these specialists may be the only places with winter equipment.\\n\\nIn remote northern locations where food, fuel and equipment have to be shipped in, ''prices on more-or-less everything can be very high''. Major northern cities tend to have better prices than more isolated areas, but still higher than in areas further south. Most travellers should buy much of their equipment before setting out; this gives more time for shopping, saves money, and avoids arriving in summer clothing when it is seriously cold outside.\\n\\nSome travellers should plan an extra stop for shopping; for example, going from Miami (where good winter gear is likely to be hard to find) to view the Lights in [[Churchill]] (where it is likely to be expensive and selection limited), one might stop in [[Chicago]], [[Toronto]] or [[Winnipeg]] to outfit oneself.\\n\\nFor specific information on winter clothing, see [[Cold weather#Clothing|Cold weather]]. Remember that you will have to use your fingers, so a combination of gloves and mittens can be useful.\\n\\n===Photography===\\n\\nTaking good pictures of the Northern Lights is '''very difficult''', since they're fast-moving, often faint and against a pitch-dark background, all of which befuddles consumer point-and-shoot cameras. Almost any [[Travel photography/Full systems|interchangeable lens camera]] can handle the job, given the right lens, but the typical \\\"kit lens\\\" sold with them will almost certainly not be fast enough and may not be wide enough either.\\n{{infobox|Lens focal lengths|In discussing focal length, we assume a 35mm film camera or \\\"full frame\\\" digital camera. For other types of camera, the actual numbers are different but the \\\"35mm equivalent\\\" is often quoted.}}\\nLong exposures are often required to capture faint lights. Here's what you need for a sporting chance:\\n\\n* A camera that supports '''manual exposure''' (5 to 40 seconds)\\n* A '''fast lens''' (aperture f/2.8 or better). Typically, a [[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|wide-angle lens]] is used to get a large area of sky.\\n* '''Fast film''' (800 ASA or better), or equivalent ISO setting on a digital camera\\n* A '''tripod''' to hold the long exposure\\n* '''Cable release or self-timer''' to trigger shots without stirring the camera\\n: Even better, for some cameras a '''remote control''' is available. Some cameras can use a wireless '''smartphone connection''' as remote control, but few smartphones are made for the conditions.\\n* '''Manual focus'''. It is not recommended to just focus your lens to infinity, instead it is best done by aiming at the Moon or a bright star (ideally in the live-view mode and using the maximum zoom).\\n* Multiple '''spare batteries and memory cards''': only having them will ensure they won't be needed. Keep the spares warm.\\n* What you don't need is the lens '''filter''': it can cause interference, so better take it off your lens.\\n[[File:Aurora shapes.jpg|thumb|405x405px|Images with Canon EOS 400D, ISO 1600, f/2.8, exposure 4s\\u201330s, 17mm (24 full frame).]]\\nWith a digital camera shooting in RAW format (or at least JPG + RAW) is a good idea: if something goes wrong in the field, there is more space for corrections in post-processing that way.\\n\\nAvoid breathing on the lens, the viewer or the display to prevent frosting them up. A light source such as a flashlight or headlamp can be useful when setting up the camera and tripod, and a smartphone is handy for alerts and forecasts. However, you need to get your eyes adjusted to darkness, so it is a good idea to limit use of these and set both phone and camera LCD displays to minimum brightness.\\n\\nThe ideal location has no light pollution, offers some shelter against wind, and is easily accessible. On a cold arctic night, you definitely want to avoid lugging camera and tripod a long distance or standing around in windy conditions waiting for the right shot. Moreover, wind tends to shake the camera, which is a problem in long exposures. A bigger, sturdier tripod helps with that, but is even worse to lug around.  If possible, do some scouting by day so you can go straight to a good location at night. It is not always possible to find a great location, but even a reasonable one can give better photos with less discomfort.\\n\\nAlso, try to get something interesting in the foreground; the [[#Europe|Norwegian photo below]] is a fine example. A shot of just the sky and some snow can be a bit boring even if the Lights are good.\\n\\nEither a zoom (variable focal length) or a prime (single focal length) lens can be used; each type has advantages. Zoom lenses are more flexible; you can adjust quickly for different sizes of light display. Primes are generally significantly faster than zooms, lighter and more compact; in many cases they also give a sharper picture than a zoom lens set to the same focal length.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora borealis over Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska.jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora borealis in [[Alaska]]]]<!-- image referenced in the text, check if you move or exchange it -->\\n\\n[[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|Wide-angle lenses]] are the commonest choice for photographing the lights. They give some distortion, even producing \\\"fish-eye\\\" images in extreme cases. The photo to the right was taken with a 16mm lens; the horizon appears curved and the trees in the foreground appear slightly off vertical, but some viewers would not notice this distortion and few would find it bothersome. The [[#Time_of_year|Scandinavian photo above]] used an even wider lens and has more distortion. A slightly longer lens, perhaps 24mm, would reduce the distortion but cover less of the sky. This is where zoom lenses have a significant advantage over primes; with, say, a 16\\u201335mm zoom you can adjust each shot to get the best trade-off between distortion and coverage. In other conditions, you might carry several primes and adjust by swapping lenses, but this is remarkably inconvenient in the field in an arctic night.\\n\\nA faster lens or a high-ISO camera setting can reduce exposure time, which is good. The photo to the right used an F2.8 lens and 25-second exposure. With F4, it would need 50 seconds, at or perhaps beyond the upper limit for practical shooting. An F1.4 lens would cut the time to around six seconds. This is quite likely to give a sharper photo because the lights move less during exposure, and it allows a bit more control over the shot; if you hit the shutter release when the sky looks particularly interesting, it is more likely to stay that way for a few seconds than over a longer time. This is where prime lenses have an advantage; they are often quite a bit faster than zooms. \\n\\nCombine a fast lens with a camera that allows high ISO settings and you might get exposure time down under a second, but it is not certain that this would give a better photo. High ISO settings give more noise in the image and you might lose more from that than you gain from the shorter time.\\n\\nFast wide lenses are expensive. Checking full-frame Canon lenses on an American vendor's site mid-2013, the cheapest lenses that might be suitable for shooting the Lights are a 40mm F2.8 at about $150 or 35/2.0 near $300; those are not wide enough to be ideal, but they would be usable and anything better is more expensive. More typical choices &mdash; for someone with a nice lens collection in hand or a good budget for building one &mdash; would be 20 or 24mm F2.8, 28/1.8, or the 17\\u201340 F4 zoom, in the $450 to $750 price range. The ideal choice might be either a 24/1.4 prime or 16\\u201335 F2.8 zoom, but these are high-end products mainly for professional photographers; either is around $1500. An ultra-wide 14mm F2.8 is a very good choice, and while those with auto-focus cost over $2000, some manual focus versions are available for a significantly lower price. Other brands have a different set of products and prices, but the overall pattern is similar. Companies other than the camera manufacturers also offer lenses, but again the pattern is similar.\\n\\nSee [[travel photography]] for more general discussion.\\n\\n==Locations==\\n[[File:Rovaniemi - Aurora Borealis.jpg|thumb|Aurora in [[Rovaniemi]], [[Finland]]]]\\nNorthern Lights usually form about 100 km (60 miles) above the surface of the earth. In principle, all areas under the Northern Lights oval are good observation points. However, most of these areas are remote and inaccessible, and suffer harsh climatic conditions.\\n\\nWhen selecting an observation site:\\n* If using a car, stay close to it. A typical car heater cannot actually keep a large metal vehicle warm when it is well below zero outside, but it is better than nothing and a car does provide shelter against wind. In really cold weather, leave the engine running even when you are away from the car, since the engine may have trouble starting again.\\n* Try finding accommodation in an area known to be good for viewing the Northern Lights. This may include a cottage, wilderness hut, a heated tent or similar shelter. This avoids long drives late at night to get to and from the viewing area.\\n* Avoid locations with light pollution; try to get away from populated areas. If this is not possible, try to have at least the northern view free of light pollution.\\n* Avoid steep hillsides or other major obstacles to the north.\\n\\nConsider bringing a tent or just a portable windbreak to provide some shelter from wind. Also vacuum flasks for hot beverages.\\n\\nViewing or photographing the Lights is an activity where hiring a local guide or paying for a tour is often worthwhile. A guide's local knowledge can help in several areas: coping with the weather, finding good sites, choosing good routes, and avoiding close encounters with [[dangerous wildlife]] such as polar bears or musk oxen. Also, a guide or tour company will have vehicles and other equipment suitable for the conditions. In remote areas it may not be possible to rent a vehicle or bring your own and, even if it is possible, it is not advisable unless both vehicle and driver are well prepared for [[winter driving]]. Some tours offer unusual transport options such as snowmobiles or sleds pulled by dogs, reindeer or horses; few tourists could safely drive those, and no owner of valuable animals is likely to allow a visitor to handle them unsupervised.\\n\\nVarious locations provide some kind of infrastructure, like tours, observation points etc. Here are lists of some major ones, in approximately west-to-east order:\\n\\n===North America===\\n{{seealso|Winter in North America}}\\n[[File:Flickr - DVIDSHUB - Alaska Aurora Borealis (Image 1 of 2).jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora in [[Alaska]]]]\\n*[[Fairbanks]], Alaska: famous for aurora viewing, with many tours and sites that cater to aurora watchers.\\n*[[Yellowknife]], in Canada's Northwest Territories, also with many tours\\n*[[Churchill]], on Hudson's Bay in Manitoba, is right smack dab in the center of the auroral belt, and offers the opportunity to see (lots of) polar bears on the same trip.\\n*[[Isle Royale National Park]], Upper Michigan, is a leave-no-trace park with no tours and few facilities. This is the best place in the 48 contiguous US sates to see the lights because it is quite far north and there is no light pollution.\\n\\n===North Atlantic islands===\\n\\n*[[Kangerlussuaq]], Greenland: very high chance of seeing the Lights from November to March. If dogsled or snowmobile rides are desired, mid-late winter is recommended.\\n*[[M\\u00fdvatn]], Iceland: offers the unique experience of observing aurorae while soaking in a natural geothermal bath. The capital, [[Reykjavik]], serves as a base for many tours.\\n*[[Berneray]], Outer Hebrides: this remote Scottish island offers suitable conditions for northern lights observation due to low light pollution.\\n\\n===Europe===\\n[[File:Aurora over Haja-3,2.jpg|thumb|Near Troms\\u00f8\\u200e, Norway]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\n{{Seealso|Winter in the Nordic countries}}\\n\\n* [[Abisko]], Northern Sweden. A popular place where the northern lights can be watched from the Aurora Sky Station at the top of the mountain Nuolja.\\n* [[Troms\\u00f8]], Northern Norway, is an easily accessible location with mild weather and numerous excursions. However the coastal location makes it susceptible to overcast conditions. Nearby [[Skibotn]] enjoys a dryer climate (very dry for Norway); this makes for better viewing opportunities. Another nearby location is [[Senja]] island.\\n* [[Alta]], also in Norway but further to the north-east and known for prehistoric rock carvings, is marketed also as a place to watch northern lights.\\n* [[Jukkasj\\u00e4rvi]], Northern Sweden, is the site of the original Ice Hotel, with excellent viewing infrastructure.\\n* [[Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi]], [[Inari]] and [[Utsjoki]] in Finnish Lapland all have quite dry weather and little light pollution.<!-- Nellim is another village which is far from light pollution. Add when there is an article.--> The ski resorts [[Saariselk\\u00e4]] in Inari and [[Levi]] in Kittil\\u00e4 have accommodation in glass igloos specially designed for enjoying the northern lights.\\n* The Kola Peninsula of [[Murmansk Oblast]] is Russia's most popular viewing spot.\\n\\nThe likelihood of seeing aurorae rapidly decreases when going south. In [[Helsinki]], aurorae occur about once a month, and are usually masked by light pollution or clouds. Aurorae seen further outside of the auroral belts may also be much less vivid, with fewer colours.\\n\\n=== Cruise ships ===\\nA luxurious way to see the lights is to take a [[cruise ship]] along the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Alaska]], or toward [[Antarctica]] for the Southern Lights, in the appropriate season. Cruises tend to be expensive, but the costs may be quite reasonable compared to flying to a good site on land and paying for accommodation and tours there. Viewing the Lights by just strolling on deck after dinner is much more convenient than being driven somewhere to stand in the snow, and the chance of encounters with dangerous wildlife is lower. \\n\\nThere may be problems with this; not all cruise lines run in winter and it is ''extremely'' difficult to get good photos from a moving ship when the subject requires long exposures, as the lights generally do. If the cruise is not specially for aurora viewing, chances are that light pollution from the ship itself is an issue.\\n\\n=== In flight ===\\nMany travelers in the northern latitudes find themselves treated to an aerial view of the lights. It's probably not realistic to ''plan'' to see them while on a plane, but if you find yourself taking frequent flights in upper latitudes, consider opting for a window seat on the northern side of the plane. If the show is good enough, the captain will usually make an announcement.\\n\\nIf you thought cruises on the seas were expensive, you probably won't be interested in heading up into '''[[space]]''', but orbital flight at around $35 million/person is a pretty surefire way to see the lights, both Northern and Southern, with zero light interference, and quite a grand view!\\n\\n== The ''Southern'' Lights ==\\n[[File:Aurora Australis Over the Tasman Sea from SouthWest National Park.jpg|thumb|Aurora Australis as seen at the remote New Harbour Beach in Tasmania's Southwest National Park]]\\nAurorae happen in an oval about the South Magnetic Pole just as they do about the North one, and the South Magnetic Pole is similarly offset from the geographic [[South Pole]]. Would-be observers of the '''Southern Lights''' or '''''Aurora Australis''''' benefit from the happy accident that the offset of the South Magnetic Pole is generally in the direction of [[Australia]], although the Pole itself is still in [[Antarctica]] like the geographic one. The southern parts of Australia and [[New Zealand]] get more than their share of Lights relative to their latitude.\\n\\nIn particular, [[Tasmania]] and the [[South Island]] of New Zealand are places where the Lights can be observed several times a year. If conditions are right, [[Hobart]] and [[Invercargill]] offer the best chance in places that are quickly accessible from within Australia and New Zealand.  Although [[Christchurch]] has a geographic latitude south of [[Hobart]], its \\\"geomagnetic latitude\\\" is further north, and aurora there are no more likely than southern [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. Check the space weather while you are travelling.\\n[[File:AuroraAustralisDisplay.jpg|thumb|Southern Lights seen from [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]]]\\n\\nAll these locations are still outside the auroral belt itself, so the odds of catching the lights during your trip there are not good. Because of the skew towards the Eastern Hemisphere, it is not reasonable to expect any viewing from [[Patagonia]], and it's not that likely you'll see them even from the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The best place to view them would be Antarctica's [[Ross Sea]] via [[Macquarie Island]] (Australia) or the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]]. The best viewing would be from the boat itself. The closest island to the auroral belt that has a good range of tourist accommodation is [[Stewart Island]]. \\n\\nThere is day trip flight from [[Sydney]] to see the Southern Lights (A$1,295+).\\n\\nAll of the considerations about maximizing your chances of seeing the Northern Lights apply equally to seeing the Southern Lights, except that the Southern Hemisphere seasons should be taken into account in regards to maximizing the hours of darkness.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Astronomy]]\\n* [[Midnight sun]] \\u2014 at latitudes where there's dark all day in the winter and people travel to see the Northern Lights, there's usually light all night in the summer.\\n{{PartOfTopic|Natural attractions|the Arctic}}\\n{{guidetopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Campbell Island banner.jpg|caption=Campbell Island|unesco=yes}}\\n[[File:Campbell2.jpg|thumb|Sea lions ashore on Campbell Island]]\\n\\n[[New Zealand]]'s '''Subantarctic Islands''' are five groups of uninhabited and windswept islands in the Southern Ocean far to the south or east of [[Stewart Island]].

Invercargill is the main centre of the [[Southland]] region, and the service city for the farms of the fertile Southland plains.

The winter months see sunrises as late as 8:30AM, with sunsets at around 5PM, followed with sunrises shortly before 6AM and sunsets past 9:30PM in the summer months around December.

It lies 30&nbsp;km to the south of the South Island, separated from it by Foveaux Strait. With an area of 1,746&nbsp;km\\u00b2 (674&nbsp;mi\\u00b2), it is far smaller than the two main islands, but is nearly twice the size of the next largest island, [[Chatham Islands|Chatham Island]] with 920&nbsp;km\\u00b2 (355&nbsp;mi\\u00b2), and far bigger than all the other small islands of the temperate New Zealand archipelago.\\n\\nIts original Maori name, '''Te Punga o Te Waka a Maui''', positions Stewart Island firmly at the heart of Maori mythology. Translated as \\\"The Anchor Stone of Maui's Canoe\\\", this refers to the part played by this island in the legend of Maui and his crew who, from their canoe (the South Island), caught and raised the great fish, the North Island. However, the more commonly used name is '''Rakiura'''. Translated as \\\"The great and deep blushing of Te Rakitamau\\\", an early Maori chief, it is seen today as the glowing sunrises, sunsets and the ''aurora australis'' or [[Southern Lights]]. \\n\\nMost of the remote backcountry of Stewart Island (but not the populated or road-accessible areas) makes up '''Rakiura National Park'''.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Wharf and Presbyterian church in Oban lit up by the setting sun.jpg|thumb|Oban Wharf, Visitor Centre (dark red) and church (light red) in the setting sun]]\\nMost of the island is covered in native forest and virtually the entire population of about 400 is concentrated in the township of Oban (also known as Halfmoon Bay) on the east coast. Commercial fishing and tourism are the two main occupations for residents. The main attractions for visitors are hiking (called tramping in New Zealand), birdwatching, fishing and deer hunting.\\n\\nAlthough Stewart Island looks small on a map next to the South Island, it is large: 64&nbsp;km long, 40&nbsp;km across (at its widest point), with a 700-km coastline. But there are only 20&nbsp;km of roads. You can't walk round the island in a day \\u2013 even ten days tramping only skirts the northern third. Few people have seen anywhere near the whole of the island.\\n\\nThere is much to see, even close to the only settlement of Oban. Come for a daytrip or stay longer, as there is a good range of accommodation. Some visitors from 20 years ago are still living here.\\n\\nThe terrain is rugged. Stewart Island is made of granite, some of the oldest rock in New Zealand. A wide range of minerals are present, though not in commercial quantities. Tin was mined at Port Pegasus for a few years in the 1890s. There's black iron sand on some beaches, others are white with quartz or red with garnet. Most beaches are gold, sparkling in the sun. Don't bother bringing a gold pan though: it's all \\\"fool's gold\\\"!\\n\\nPaterson Inlet cuts the Island almost in half. This large expanse of water is popular for boat trips and recreational fishing and diving.\\n\\nThe climate is mild, and a bit damp, but without rain, there wouldn't be a rainforest. The eastern lowlands are forest right to the water's edge. A canopy of kamahi is pierced by majestic rimu and miro. Lianes and lush fern growth adorn the bush interior.\\n\\nThe forest is a haven for bird-life, as there are fewer predators than on the mainland. Kaka, parakeets, tui, and bellbird give a wonderful dawn chorus in spring. New Zealand's national bird, the kiwi, is found all around the island. Seabirds abound offshore. Albatross, petrels, cormorants, gulls and blue penguins are common. Rarer species like yellow-eye penguins are also seen often.\\n\\nMason Bay, on the island's west coast is much different. It's a 20-km crescent of sandy beach, with huge sand-hills and tussock and scrub in place of forest. This is the place to watch the white-horses charge ashore in a screaming westerly gale.\\n\\n===Visitor information ===\\n* [http://www.stewartisland.co.nz/ Stewart Island Visitor Information] website\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Oban Visitor Centre | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=The Red Shed, 12 Elgin Terr | lat= | long= | directions=near the wharf\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2016-01-02\\n| content=Visitor info, bookings and car, scooter and bike hire.\\n}}\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[File:Stewart Island ferry approaching Oban.jpg|thumb|A ferry approaching Stewart Island]]\\nGetting there requires crossing Foveaux Strait by boat or plane from [[Southland]] on the mainland.\\n\\n===By boat===\\n[http://www.stewartislandexperience.co.nz Stewart Island Experience] runs a scheduled passenger ferry service from [[Bluff]], near [[Invercargill]], to Oban/Half Moon Bay, with 2-4 departures during the day (dependent on time of year). The crossing is 22 nautical miles or 39&nbsp;km and takes one hour. Adult $125 each way, children (4\\u201314) half-price. Long-stay parking is available at the Bluff terminal. From Invercargill, there's a shuttle that will pick you up from the airport or hotel and bring you to the ferry terminal for an extra $35 (children half-price) each way.\\n\\nOccasionally other boats, usually charter vessels, make the crossing.\\n\\n===By plane===\\n{{marker|type=go|name=[http://www.stewartislandflights.com/ Stewart Island Flights]|lat=-46.89920|long=168.12908}} makes three 20-minute flights a day from Invercargill Airport. $148 one-way, $256 return for adults, $100 one-way, $166 return for children (4\\u201314), free for infants (under 4, on lap of adults). Amazingly, this is cheaper than a round trip with the ferry and connection shuttles for adults, though it doesn't include pickup at hotels in Invercargill, and there is a 15kg baggage.

They come out only after dark, and are most often spotted at the edges of open areas such as roads or lawns (listening for their calls can help). If you plan to go looking on your own, bring a red light or buy the \\\"Kiwi-spotting kitset\\\" (piece of red cellophane and rubber band) from the Four Square market ($0.50); shining a normal white flashlight at a kiwi may disturb it. \\n\\nYou have a decent chance of finding one if you spend a few hours driving the back roads at night, or a few nights poking around on foot on the hiking trails and town rugby field. But your odds are much better if you go with one of the several tour operators (from $100 per person), which can take you their special spots (some go to the town's airstrip, which isn't open to the public).\\n\\nYou will sometimes see Ulva Island sanctuary (see below) advertised as \\\"the only place to see wild kiwis in the daytime\\\", but this is very rare. Even experienced birdwatchers don't usually see any kiwi there. If you do go there, don't mistake the weka \\u2013 a much more commonly-seen ground bird of a similar size, shape and colour \\u2013 for a kiwi. Ulva Island is strictly closed to the public at nighttime.\\n\\nMason Bay, on the west coast, is probably the easiest place on Stewart Island (and perhaps in the world) to see kiwis in the wild, but is not accessible by road or day hike.\\n\\n*[http://www.nzwalk.com '''Kiwi Wilderness Walks'''] offer an all inclusive guided walk that starts in Invercargill, spends a night at Mason Bay then walk and water taxis across the island to Halfmoon Bay.\\n\\n===Other nature watching===\\n[[File:Two oystercatchers on a Stewart Island beach.jpg|thumb|Two oystercatchers on a Stewart Island beach]]\\nThe outskirts of Oban village are one of the best places in southern New Zealand to see kaka parrots, and native tui birds are abundant. Penguins may sometimes be seen within the village in the evenings, as can long-tailed bats, seals and sea lions, and occasionally even kiwi. Sooty shearwaters nest on Ackers Point, and can be seen in late evening over the summer. Stewart Island is known for its relative abundance of podocarp tree species, and is also overflowing with a multitude of fern species.\\n\\n====Ulva Island====\\n[http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/southland/places/stewart-island-rakiura/ulva-island-te-wharawhara/things-to-do/ulva-island-walking-tracks/ Ulva Island Open Sanctuary] (in relative isolation but with easy access from Stewart Island) is a sanctuary for both birds and plants, holding species that are rare or have died out on the mainland of New Zealand. Partially private land and partially national park, Ulva Island is possibly the closest to pristine of any area of New Zealand open to the public. In 1997, the island was declared rat-free, following an eradication program, and extirpated birds have been reintroduced to the island (rats have continued to reinvade and be re-exterminated). Specialty birds include the South Island saddleback (tieke), yellowhead (mohua), red-crowned parakeet (kakariki), and Stewart Island robin (toutouwai). A skilled birder can find all of them within a few hours, and even a non-birder is likely to notice the chicken-like weka, which are particularly common here. In addition to birds the general forest health has improved significantly. Many orchids can now be seen that are difficult to find on mainland Stewart Island. New Zealand sea lions are often seen on the beaches. Water taxis and a ferry service regularly make the short trip from Golden Bay. \\n\\nYou can take yourself around Ulva or take a guided tour. If you don't stop much, it takes about 2 hours to walk all the trails, which actually only cover the northern quarter of the island (the rest is inaccessible to the public). If you like to take it slow or expect to be doing a lot of birdwatching, give yourself much more than that.\\n\\n* {{do\\n| name=Ulva Island ferry | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=-46.90403 | long=168.12157 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=Weather dependent, closed in winter | price=$25 round-trip per person if paying with cash, $27 with card\\n| lastedit=2022-11-22\\n| content=Departs from Golden Bay at 9AM, noon, and 2PM.

The difference is that most ice cap climates have permanent ice and snow cover, often hundreds of metres deep, while tundra climates are mostly ice-free (on the surface) in summer.

It is the seat of the Alt Empord\\u00e0 county in the [[Girona (province)|Girona Province]] and has a wealth of history spanning many centuries that has been preserved and shown in several museums in the area and in the compact Old Town.  Being the last major town before the Spanish/French border, it serves as a fantastic base to explore the upper Empord\\u00e1 region that is awash in great food, wines, and beaches that represent the Catalan culture. It is a stage in the [[Catalan Way of St. James]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\nThe city's main attraction is the world famous museum of native son, Salvador Dal\\u00ed . After the Prado in [[Madrid]], it is the most visited museum in all of Spain.  It is often seen as part of a day-trip from [[Barcelona]] or the packaged hotels of [[Costa Brava]].\\n[[File:Esgl\\u00e9sia de Sant Pere in Figueres 19.JPG|right|thumb|Sant Pere church]]\\nBut beyond the museum, Figueres can be a pleasant place to spend a night or two.  The town, much like Girona, is a relaxed alternative to Barcelona with caf\\u00e9s on side streets, and a compact Old Town core.  The Empord\\u00e0 region in general will appeal to those interested in the history or the burgeoning viticulture and gastronomy of Northern Catalonia.  Figueres works well as a base for day trips to these destinations. Figueres is also 15 minutes by car or 25 minutes by train from the beaches of the Costa Brava.\\n\\nThe name of the town means 'fig trees' as they used to grow in great abundance around the area.  Local youth often refer to the town as 'Figui' for short.\\n\\n===History===\\nFigueres descended from two Roman towns, Junc\\u00e0ria and Fig\\u00e0ries, but the establishment of the town really started to happen in the 10th century as stated in records from the Sant Pere Monastery that was located where the Sant Pere church is today. As it was not an outpost border town in the Marca Hispanica (such as neighboring [[Besal\\u00fa]] or Peralada), it was of little significance until it was made a Royal Town in 1267 and then much later, when the Sant Ferran castle was built from 1753 to 1766.\\n\\nOnce the castle was finished, fortunes changed a great deal for Figueres as it became the supply base for the castle. The population grew and it started its course towards being the major town of the region, despite occupation by Napoleon's forces from 1808\\u20131814. Between 1831 and 1840, the Rambla was created by covering a dry riverbed, and became a center for the town. The shade trees that stand on the Rambla were planted in 1864. In 1877, the railway station was opened. In 1904, the town's most famous resident, one Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dal\\u00ed i Dom\\u00e8nech was born.\\n\\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) was quite hard on the town. The castle became the last outpost for Republican Spain and Franco's forces bombed the town with great ferocity. As was the case with a lot of the surrounding area, many structures were lost in the war, including the main theater, which stood in ruin for several decades.\\n\\nUpon attaining critical and financial success around the world, Dal\\u00ed bought the old theater in his home town and converted it in to the museum that we see today, and which is a major draw of tourism to the town.\\n\\n===Tourist information ===\\n*[https://visitcatalonia.net/figueres/ Figueres] information from Visit Catalonia \\n\\n==Talk==\\nEverybody in Figueres can speak [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]], albeit to varying degrees. Although [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] was banned by the Franco regime and Spanish was the only language, the older generation above 60, when speaking Spanish, will often speak a form of \\\"Spatalan\\\", which is mostly Spanish but with a lot of Catalan tossed in. It can be difficult to understand at times for foreigners. Catalan is as separate a language from Spanish as French and Italian are. It is not a Spanish dialect.\\n\\nNorthern Catalan, which is spoken here, is strongly influenced by French through the interchange with French and Catalan speakers across the border . Such dishes as 'pa amb tomaquet' (bread with tomato) become 'pa amb tomate' with a soft 'uh' sound at the end. There are many more examples and one of the most difficult is when they say words that end with 'o' and say it with a long 'u' sound. If you make the effort to say neighboring town names in Catalan, make sure you understand the pronunciation and if you say Barcelona pronouncing the Castillian 'th' sound for the 'c', people will assume that you are speaking Spanish.\\n\\nThe generation under 35 will generally speak some if not a good deal of English and French. Some people may speak a little Italian and oddly enough, there is a large Russian-speaking community in Figueres.\\n\\n== Get in ==\\n{{Mapframe | 42.265 | 2.960 | height=500 | width=550 | zoom=14 }}\\n=== By plane === \\n[[Girona]] Costa Brava Airport ({{IATA|GRO}}) has budget flights by Ryanair.

The central building was the old town theater, long vacant after being bombed during the Spanish Civil War. Even art fans who are otherwise lukewarm to Dal\\u00ed's general artistry can find visiting here a rewarding experience, and may come out with new appreciation for the eccentric genius. The museum also contains displays of other Catalan artists. Many major works were removed by Spanish authorities shortly after his death and displayed in the Prado, in Madrid.<br>The number of visitors is limited and only tickets not sold online can be purchased at the ticket office. It is recommended to purchase tickets online in advance (at least one day before, since same-day tickets are not available online). You can have an audioguide for \\u20ac1 per room--although Dal\\u00ed's original concept was to not allow ''any'' guides explaining anything to visitors: they should understand as much as they're able to without help. Crowds are large during the summer months. Weekends are best avoided as the experience will not be pleasant.

There is a resurgence of viticulture in the region, and is creating some of the most noteworthy wines in all of Catalonia, especially for the price.\\n\\nAs Figueres is the seat of Alt Empord\\u00e0, it also houses the offices for the local [http://www.doemporda.com/ DO Empord\\u00e0] region which can be found at Avinguda Marignane, 2. The office can provide more information, although the website is extremely helpful in locating wineries.\\n\\nFor those wishing to make a tour of the wineries, you will definitely need a car as they are in far-flung villages around the area.  Closest to Figueres are the wineries of [http://www.lavineta.es La Vinyeta] and [http://www.castilloperelada.com/ Perelada].  The former is a very new, modern winery started by a young winemaker who is making some of the most exciting wines in the region neat the village of Mollets.  The later is a much more established winery that sits next to the castle of Perelada, which is a small town about five minutes by car from Figueres.  Their wines are rather pricey, but they have grown to carry a high pedigree whether deserved or not.  Perelada also charges for tastings, which is rather uncommon.\\n\\nOutside of these two regions, a drive up to the village Cantallops is recommended as in addition to being a delightful town, it houses the wineries of [http://www.vinyesdelsaspres.cat/ Vinyes dels Aspres] and Masia Serra.  Both of these wineries are making splendid wines, especially the sweet Garnatxas (Grenache) and Moscatells.  You will need to call Masia Serra before visiting though as it is rarely open to the public.\\n\\nAnother village worth visiting for wine is Capmany which has [http://www.cellerarchepages.com/ Arch\\u00e9 Pag\\u00e8s] and about 10 other wineries.\\n\\nHeading in the other direction, one can go to Vilaju\\u00efga which has  [http://www.empordalia.com/ Empord\\u00e0lia] which makes the Sinols brand.  Additionally, they also have wine 'a granel' or in bulk that is of high quality and can be bought for less than \\u20ac1.50 a litre.\\n\\nThe local wine shops in Figueres sell all these brands for those wishing to take back something from Figueres that isn't related to Dal\\u00ed.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\nFigueres provides a variety of hotels, with rates much cheaper than in Barcelona, but generally comparable to Girona. In addition to actual hotel and hostel establishments there are a great many 'masias' in the area which are farm houses that were converted over to rural guest houses.  The prices can be quite good and the accommodations very nice, although the proprietors rarely speak English and thus they can be tricky to find at times.\\n\\n===Budget===\\n\\n* {{sleep\\n| name=Hostal Galicia | url=http://www.hostalgalicia.net/ | email=\\n| address=Avd.

Violent crime is extremely rare and most issues resolve around petty theft when they happen.  As is the case in many places, beware of crowded areas and events as pickpockets can frequent these venues.\\n\\nIn the summer, it can get quite hot as is typical with coastal Catalonia. Make sure to drink plenty of water and cover your head if sensitive to heavy direct sunlight.\\n\\nIn the winter, it can be quite cold at times. While snow is exceptionally rare in Figueres proper, driving on the E-15 or the AP-7 north to France could very well require chains or snow tires near La Jonquera at certain times due to the pass often receiving a decent amount of snow. Likewise, driving west from Figueres, the mountain roads climb in elevation quite rapidly and snow is common, so plan car trips accordingly.\\n\\n== Connect ==\\nAs of Jan 2024, Figueres and its approach highways have 5G from all Spanish carriers.\\n\\n==Go next==\\n* [[Barcelona]] - The capital and main city of Catalonia with a wealth of attractions.\\n* [[Besal\\u00fa]] - A very old town to the West of Figueres that has a historic bridge.\\n* [[Blanes]] - A beach resort with two botanical gardens and modernist buildings is easily reachable by train.\\n* [[Cadaqu\\u00e9s]] - A nice seaside town that also houses one of Dal\\u00ed's other homes for those wanting to see more Dal\\u00ed history.\\n* [[Cantallops]] - A compact mountain town with two wineries and some good restaurants.\\n* [[Cap de Creus]] - The Eastern end of Spain.

Centred along the Las Ramblas boulevard, it includes Barcelona's old port as well as parts built from the early Middle Ages to mid-19th century. Ciutat Vella is where the nightlife, as well as the tourist traffic in Barcelona is centred.\\n\\nIf you are looking for the famous Gaudi creations, they are not here - except for Palau G\\u00fcell - head over to [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]] and [[Barcelona/Gracia|Gracia]] to see them.\\n\\n[[File:La Rambla Barcelona 2004.JPG|thumb|right|View of Las Ramblas, Barcelona]]\\n==Understand==\\n\\nThe district is divided in four quarters:\\n\\n* '''Barceloneta''' or ''Little Barcelona'' was built after King Felipe V ordered the construction of a new fortress (La Ciutadella, nowadays a park) in order to control and punish the city of Barcelona, that fought against him during the war of Spanish Succession. The fortress was planned very close to the city so that a tenth of it was demolished, and the people who lived in this part had no compensation and as a bigger punishment were obliged to demolish their own houses.  The people from the demolished part of Barcelona had to move, so a new quarter was planned by the French military. Therefore, the streets are straight and with a square shape. There are still some houses from this period, easy to recognize because they are much lower than the others and have a simple neoclassical decoration.  Historically a fisherman's quarter, Barceloneta was traditionally a poor quarter, with dark and narrow streets, but since the 1992 Olympics significant gentrification has taken place. Most noticeably along the seafront. There are now delis serving upscale foodstuffs and high rise office buildings going up.\\n* '''Barri G\\u00f2tic''' is the oldest part of the old town.  It literally has its foundations in Roman times as it was built upon the old settlement of Barcino.  It's quite easy to see these portions of the Roman wall through this area and for those looking to see more, you can visit the City History museum which takes you below ground to tour the 2,000 year-old foundations.  Fully pedestrian, this area is quite popular for visitors to see the history of the city.  While not as active in boutique shops as La Ribera next door, it boasts its fair share of night life and shops.  Most people walk through here to view the quite stunning architecture with the ancient building leaning this way and that on their centuries-old foundations.  It is also the location of the Barcelona Cathedral which is a focal point of the city.\\n* '''La Ribera''' is a large section of the old town that encompasses everything between Arc de Triomf and Via Laietana.  It is often mistakenly called the El Born after the large, 19th-century market that sits in the area below Carrer de la Princesa.  In reality, Born is a sub neighborhood of La Ribera much like the area around the upper, Santa Catarina market.  Regardless of whether you go to the upper or lower sections, it is a very happening neighborhood with lots to do and see.  By day, there are many small shops and local designers.  By night, there is a thriving bar and restaurant scene.  It's easily reachable on foot and contains no end of old buildings, many of which date back to the 15th century.  It's easy to see the thriving, commercial past of the neighborhood with colourful names such as (in English): \\\"the street of jars\\\", \\\"the street of the silver smiths\\\", and so on.\\n* '''El Raval''' is the neighborhood of the old town just to the west of Las Ramblas.  Historically, it's had an incredibly seedy reputation, being a den of prostitution, drugs, and general crime.  This changed on a tremendous scale right before the 1992 Olympics when the city government demolished tremendous amounts of old buildings to construct new ones as well as to open up the neighborhood to more natural light given that historically, it was known to be quite dark.  This move was quite controversial as it displaced thousands of people, but for better or worse, it did change the neighborhood.  These days, it's a vibrant place for nightlife and while still very much an immigrant neighborhood, it's home to no end of bars and restaurants.  While not as historically significant as say, Barri G\\u00f2tic or La Ribera, but gradually more civic structures are sprouting in the area, such as the Filmoteca.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{Mapframe|41.379|2.181|zoom=14}}\\n{{Mapshape}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q237189}} <!-- metro -->\\n\\nSince Ciutat Vella is also the city centre, nearly all public transportation leads you there.

It was built at the final part of the 19th century in the place that formerly occupied the fortress (''ciutadella'') built after the defeat of 1714. This fortress was hated by the citizens, and when the middle age walls were demolished, so was most of the fortress. Some buildings where conserved, as such as the church, and the gunpowder magazine. The new park was used as the place to hold the 1888 international expo, and some of the older modernist buildings are there, such as the Zoology Museum, the greenhouse and, following the avenue ''Passeig de Sant Joan'' (towards the mountain), the ''Arc del Triomf'', a modernist ''Arc de Triomphe''.\\n}}\\n\\n[[File:PortVell.JPG|thumb|250px|''Rambla de Mar'' bridge in Port Vell (Old Port)]]\\n* {{see\\n| name=Port Vell | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=41.37675 | long=2.184639 | directions=walk down La Rambla until the monument to Columbus, the sea is just after it\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Port Vell | image=Port-Vell-Night.JPG | wikidata=Q1114612\\n| content=The harbor was closed to the public until the 80s and received a complete makeover before the Olympics in 1992.

A major port on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain, Barcelona has a wide variety of attractions that bring in tourists from around the globe. The many faces of Barcelona include the medieval Old Town, and the unique street grid resulting from 19th-century urban planning. The city has long sandy beaches and green parks on the hills, pretty much side-by-side. It is also famous for a number of prominent buildings, of which the most-known are by the architect Antoni Gaud\\u00ed, including his ''Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia'', which became Barcelona's symbol to many.\\n\\nFounded more than 2,000 years ago as the [[Roman empire|ancient Roman]] town ''Barcino'', Barcelona is as historic as it is modern, with a constant flow of projects changing the face of the city and long-standing penchant for design and innovation. Thanks to the wealth of attractions, a very well-developed accommodation base, a lively nightlife and a robust transportation system, Barcelona has become one of Europe's, and pretty much the world's, most popular tourist destinations.\\n\\n==Districts==\\n\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500|show=mask,go}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q941385|fill=#bdbd7b|title=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q64124|fill=#8888dc|title=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q852697|fill=#75bb75|title=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q753075|fill=#aa6baa|title=[[Barcelona/Sants-Montju\\u00efc|Sants-Montju\\u00efc]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q250935|fill=#67b7b7|title=[[Barcelona/Sant Mart\\u00ed|Sant Mart\\u00ed]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q959944, Q1765582, Q1771488, Q1641049, Q1650230 |fill=#c9815e|title=[[Barcelona/Inland Suburbs|Inland Suburbs]]}} <!-- Les Corts, Sarri\\u00e0-Sant Gervasi, Horta-Guinard\\u00f3, Nou Barris, Sant Andreu -->\\n\\n{{Mapshapes|Q237189|stroke-opacity=0.6}} <!-- metro -->\\n\\n{{Regionlist\\n| region1name=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]\\n| region1color=#bdbd7b\\n| region1description=Barcelona's old town, including the medieval Barri G\\u00f2tic, La Rambla (Les Rambles), Raval, and El Born (also known as La Ribera)\\n\\n| region2name=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]\\n| region2color=#8888dc\\n| region2description=Modernist quarter, central hub of the city, and ''the'' area to go to find Antoni Gaud\\u00ed's work.\\n\\n| region3name=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]\\n| region3color=#75bb75\\n| region3description=Formerly an independent town, it joined the city in the 20th century.

However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\\n\\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to [[Costa Daurada]], north to [[Costa Brava]] or out to sea for the [[Balearic Islands]].\\n\\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low. Given the high humidity, {{convert|19|-|23|\\u00b0C|0}} is considered comfortable weather, which is usually the temperature from May to June, and from late August to October. These are the best times to visit the city.  Anything warmer than this can feel too hot, and the period from November to April is quite chilly and at times gloomy.\\n\\n===With children===\\nToddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain. In any public place, people around you will make every effort possible to make your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them.

Fa\\u00e7ana de la Passi\\u00f3.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia church by Antoni Gaud\\u00ed is perhaps the most known landmark of Barcelona]]\\n\\nBarcelona's official languages are [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] and [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]. About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese. On the other hand, FGC announcements \\u2013 either regular or disruptions \\u2013 will be made only in Catalan, and disruption announcements on RENFE's network will usually be made only in Spanish. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a separate Romance language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.\\n\\nYou might find some locals answer in Catalan after being asked in Spanish, that's not because they are being rude but because they assume you are bilingual. In Catalonia, it's not uncommon to hear people code switching between different languages in the same conversation. In case you can't understand what they are saying, tell them you don't speak Catalan and politely ask them to repeat it in Spanish or English.\\n\\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia is a large scale immigration process from the rest of Spain, which occurred over the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language, and 40% use Catalan. The issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere.\\n\\nIn tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak English. If you are a native English speaker, you will have few problems, as Barcelona hosts many tourists.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\n[[File:Aeropuerto de Barcelona (1322744358).jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona International Airport]]\\nThe main airport is {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona El Prat|wikidata=Q56973}} ({{IATA|BCN}}). Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use the airports of ''[[Girona]]'' ({{IATA|GRO}}), nearly {{km|100}} to the north, or ''[[Reus]]'' ({{IATA|REU}}), around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair started operating at BCN, you should check carefully where your flight goes. The three-letter IATA code should be part of your booking process.\\n\\n====Barcelona International Airport====\\n{{main|Barcelona El Prat Airport}}\\n\\n[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Barcelona/en/Barcelona-El-Prat.html Barcelona International Airport] ({{IATA|BCN}}), also known as '''El Prat''', is a major transport hub, with flights from all over Europe and beyond, is by far the closest airport to the city. To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for \\u20ac5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs \\u20ac12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport) , tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (\\u20ac7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya on its way to Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya. See the Public Transport section in Get Around below for more information on tickets & passes as there were major changes in 2023.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Girona-Costa-Brava/en/Home.html Girona\\u2013Costa Brava Airport]====\\nThe Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estaci\\u00f3 del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport, synchronised with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs \\u20ac16 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac25. The journey takes approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Timetables are available [http://www.sagales.com/index.php?nIdioma=LANG3 online]. You can also take a train (you can choose between local ''Rodalies'', ''Media Distancia'' and high speed  AVE trains with different travel times and price points) to Girona main train station and a local bus from there to the airport.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Reus/en/ Reus Airport]====\\nThe easiest way is to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs \\u20ac13 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac24. The journey takes from 1 hr 30 min to 1 hr 45 min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available [http://www.igualadina.com/pdfs/REUS%20AIRPORT.pdf? online]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs \\u20ac7.25 and then the bus costs \\u20ac2.5. This takes about 2\\u00bd hours. Train timetables can be checked at Renfe's [http://www.renfe.com website] and the bus timetable is available at the [http://www.reustransport.cat/pdf/L50.pdf website]{{Dead link|date=November 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} of Reus public transport.\\n\\n[[File:Estacio Barcelona Sants - 1 - 2010-10-18 - JTCurses.jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona Sants railway station]]\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:RENFE AVE S-103 15.jpg|thumbnail|right|Superfast trains will whiz you to Barcelona from across Spain and France]]\\n\\nBarcelona is well-connected to the Spanish railway network, and to the rest of Europe. High-speed trains run frequently from main station {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona Sants|wikidata=Q800453|lat=41.37911238|long=2.139878268|url=https://www.adif.es/w/71801-barcelona-sants}} (in the southwest of the city) to Madrid, Seville and Malaga. There are also regular long-distance connections that partially use high-speed infrastructure to all major Spanish cities. The station is also served by many regional lines including {{rint|catalonia|rdc}}{{rint|catalonia|r1}}{{rint|catalonia|r2}}{{rint|catalonia|r2s}}{{rint|catalonia|r2n}}{{rint|catalonia|r3}}{{rint|catalonia|r4}}{{rint|catalonia|r11}}\\n\\nThe historic {{marker|type=go|name=Estaci\\u00f3 de Fran\\u00e7a|wikidata=Q800449}} now mostly serves regional trains.\\n\\nDirect regular [https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-europe/tgv-inoui-espagne/ high-speed train service] goes to destinations in France. In addition to two daily TGV services from [[Paris]] (travel time ~7 hr to Barcelona), there is a daily service from [[Lyon]] (5 hr), and a daily service from [[Marseille]] (4 hr). Prices start at \\u20ac39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\\n\\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerb\\u00e8re/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\\n\\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7\\u20138 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly \\u20ac30.\\n\\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called ''[http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/larga_distancia/productos/trenhotel.html Trenhotel]'' between Barcelona and Paris. ''Trenhotels'' still do, however, run between Barcelona and [[Granada]], [[A Coru\\u00f1a]] and [[Vigo]].\\n\\nThe security checks are taken seriously and may take some time.

There are two operators: RENFE and FGC. Wrongly ignored by some tourists, they provide a useful additional mode of transport for getting across the city or connecting with mainline rail services and the airport.\\n\\nThe trains run by RENFE share tracks with mainline trains and are called Rodalies {{rint|catalonia|rdc}} (known in the rest of Spain as Cercan\\u00edas).

Perhaps the best option in planning your route is to consult with one of the route planners mentioned above.\\n\\nA major reorganisation of bus lines was completed in November 2018, so disregard old bus schedules and recheck routes. For example, bus line 92 to Park G\\u00fcell, used by many tourists to get there after a visit to the Sagrada Familia, has been suspended, and a new line V15 stops there but takes a different route through the city centre (Passeig de Sant Joan).\\n\\nHere are some tips for bus line codes:\\n\\n* Hxx lines run parallel to the coastline, low numbers run on the high side, high numbers on the sea side.\\n* Vxx lines run from the beach to the hills, high numbers on the northern side (Bes\\u00f2s), low numbers on the southern (Llobregat).\\n* Dxx lines run in a somewhat diagonal path, although interestingly none of these cover neither Diagonal or Meridiana avenues, the main oblique streets.\\n* Mxx lines are found at the outer perimeter of metro coverage and link a metro stop to a neighbourhood lacking metro service.\\n* Bxx lines run on the northern area outside Barcelona or linking Barcelona to neighbouring municipalities in the metropolitan area, B stands for Bes\\u00f2s river.\\n* Lxx lines run on the southern area alike Bxx lines, L stands for Llobregat river.\\n* Some municipalities have lines fully inside the town limits with two letters and a digit, theses two letters are reminiscent of the town name, such as BDx for Badalona and LHx for L'Hospitalet\\n* Nxx lines run only at night when all other lines do not run, roughly from 23:00 to 6:00.\\n* Cxx lines link Barcelona the various northern coastal Maresme towns up to [[Matar\\u00f3]].\\n* Exx lines are express buses from Barcelona to various municipalities {{km|10-60}} outside of the metropolitan area.\\n* Lines with one or two digits without any letter follow historical routes from before the H-V-D schema.\\n* Lines between 100 and 199 are usually very local lines served with low-capacity cars and poor frequency, 30 min or worse. Notable cases are line 111 to the Tibidabo amusement park, line 120 through Ciutat Vella, and line 150 to Olympic venues and the Montju\\u00efc castle; others are mostly useless for tourists.\\n* Line numbers from 200 upwards are used for some routes going outside the metropolitan area, while some others of the same kind have no number at all.\\n\\nBuses H-V-D run about every 6\\u201312 min weekdays, 15\\u201320 min weekends. \\n\\nNitbus (N) run every 20 min all night.

It takes little over an hour to walk from Port Vell at the seaside to Park G\\u00fcell at the foothills of the mountain range at the northeastern end of the city, and you can see a range of attractions, including La Rambla and Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia, on your way. There are opportunities all around to sit down and enjoy a drink or a meal everywhere. If you are fit, you can pretty much explore the city by foot alone, unless the heat beats you in the warmer months (and then you can always resort to the air-conditioned metro).\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (\\u20ac3/hour, \\u20ac20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\\n\\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, ''Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes'' is actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\\n\\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\\n* Near ''Moll de Sant Bertran'' (which is south-west from ''Museu Maritim'') - driving at B\\u201310, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\\n* Somewhere near Guell Park.\\n* Near Font M\\u00e0gica, in Pla\\u00e7a Espanya and the Montju\\u00efc hill.\\n\\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.\\n\\n=== By taxi ===\\nAs of January 2019, [[Ride-sharing and carsharing services|ride-sharing services]] such as Uber require at least one hour's notice. For less than one hour's notice, you need to call a regular taxi.\\n\\n==See==\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500}}\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n{{infobox|What to see in the dark|The most spectacular sights in the night are:\\n* ''Musical fountains'', in Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.

Moreover on the Port Vell, right at the end of The Ramblas there is Maremagnum, a shopping mall that stays open all Sundays.\\n\\nIf you see people selling items on the street on a blanket, do not buy from them.

Bon\\u00c0rea, Bonpreu and Condis are the most popular supermarket chains from Catalonia. Mercadona, Consum, and Dia are other popular chains from the rest of Spain. All of them are a cost-effective way to purchase grocery items. There are also organic/specialty supermarkets like Casa Ametller or Veritas which are pricier. Small corner stores are the most visible on city streets, but tend to mark up prices in exchange for convenience.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nAs with all cities which welcome large numbers of tourists, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, but there are plenty of restaurants serving excellent food at very reasonable prices, if you know where to look. The usual rules of thumb apply: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track used by fellow travellers, and seek out caf\\u00e9s and restaurants which the locals frequent. In practice, this usually involves searching out eateries in residential districts away from the main sightseeing attractions. Avoid restaurants with touts outside, and have a basic understanding of the traditional foods served in restaurants, as well as the local drinks. One slightly crafty way of sussing a place's authenticity at a glance is to take note of how they spell a certain word: a menu board advertising ''tap'''a'''s'', written the Spanish/international way, is likely to be somewhere which primarily caters to tourists, whereas somewhere offering ''tap'''e'''s'', using Catalan spelling, is in all probability a venue frequented by locals.\\n\\nSome districts to check out include [[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]], which is a hub of quality, affordable Catalan cooking of both the traditional and more avant-garde varieties, and the [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]], whose chic boulevards have upscale restaurants aplenty worthy of your splurge money. The fishing quarter of Barceloneta (in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]) is an example of a neighbourhood where it pays to be picky: closer to the gentrified seafront, a slew of mojito beach bar-style places serve up expensive tourist tapas; for the real thing, head into the backstreets, where many traditional bars are still tucked away. In all cases, be prepared to \\\"promenade\\\" in search of the most attractive-looking menu; that's what the locals do, after all.\\n\\n{{infobox|Where to eat during siesta|The majority of restaurants and cafes are closed 16:00-20:00 for ''migdiada''. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:\\n* tapas in bars\\n* international chains\\n* food stands in market halls}}\\n\\n'''Set menus (men\\u00fa del migdia / men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda)''' Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a ''men\\u00fa del migdia'' / ''men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' (menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for \\u20ac12 to \\u20ac20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 14:00 to 16:00. The savvy traveller will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve ''platos combinados'', which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.\\n\\n'''Smoking''' is not permitted inside bars and restaurants since 2011, but it's usually allowed in terraces.\\n\\n===Dishes===\\n[[File:Tapas Barcelona.jpg|thumb|250px|A plate of ''tapes'']]\\n\\nYou can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.\\n\\n''See [[Catalonia#Catalan Cuisine|Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article]].''\\n\\nThe selection of '''seafood''' is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).\\n\\nA treat to try that no travel guide mentions is '''waffles''' sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\\n\\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\\n\\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of '''durum''' or '''shawarma''' stands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around \\u20ac5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the '''Asian''' selection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants, while '''Latin American''' offerings, particularly Argentine and [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], are well-represented too.\\n\\n===Food tours===\\n\\nIf you feel lost in the variety of food choices there are \\u2013 Catalan, Basque, Spanish, and beyond \\u2013 it may be helpful to do a food tour to quickly get oriented.

Barceloneta is a very good place to eat ''tapas'' as well.\\n* Sant Antoni is the new addition to the culinary scene in Barcelona where old and trendy cuisine mingle.\\n* Eixample Esquerra (between Gran Via and Mallorca)\\n* Barri G\\u00f2tic (especially for tapas)\\n* \\\"El Born\\\" (next to Barri G\\u00f2tic)\\n\\nAround Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya there are dozens of restaurants serving ''tapas''. One should be careful with the tourist traps as the area is highly populated with tourists.\\n\\nFor budget eating you may choose \\\"men\\u00fa del migdia\\\" in small bars on the Avinguda del Parallel for \\u20ac9-11 per person. Be aware that sometimes the menu and the staff are only in Spanish.\\n\\nThe large cafes that line the Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia and the Rambla Catalunya, just north of the Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, offer a variety of acceptable tapas.

Wi-Fi is widely available in public places and on transport.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Pickpockets===\\n\\n[[Pickpockets|Pickpocketing]] is the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona. '''Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents''' in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\\n\\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\\n* At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\\n* A milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\\n* East Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \\\"martial arts\\\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\\n* These people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\\n* Male travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\\n* In the '''subway''', a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance ''and'' exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\\n* Under no circumstances should you '''leave your items''' unattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\\n\\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can [https://denuncies.dgp.interior.gencat.cat/denuncies/ file a report online] if you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices.\\n\\n===Scams===\\n{{Seealso|Common scams}}\\n\\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\\n\\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of [[common scams#Overcharging|methods]] are employed, including the [[common scams#No-change_trick|No-change trick]]. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.\\n\\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\\n\\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\\n\\nA version of [[common scams#Three Card Monte|Three Card Monte]] is one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\\n\\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you.\\n\\n===Violent crimes===\\n\\nIn 2019 there was a surge in violent crimes around Barcelona: in just the summer, there were almost as many violent deaths as there were for the whole previous year. While tourists are only occasionally targeted (and almost exclusively simple robberies), this should be not a going concern, many of these deaths are either drug-related or take place during drunken fights, so you are best advised to avoid such situations.\\n\\n===Football===\\nLocal club '''FC Barcelona''' (also known as \\\"Bar\\u00e7a\\\", a term used by locals to refer strictly to the club and not the city) is seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and has a very heated and politically-charged rivalry with Real Madrid, which is seen as a symbol of the Spanish state and ruling establishment, and violent confrontations between the supporters of both clubs have been known to occur. Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\\n\\nFurthermore, the local ''Derbi barcelon\\u00ed'' between FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain. If you hear Bar\\u00e7a and Espanyol fans having an argument, be careful, as things can quickly escalate.\\n\\n===ATMs===\\nBarcelona offers ATMs in many locations. Many provide a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.), and most accept ATM/debit/credit cards of various banks. Choose an ATM in a secure or highly-public space (e.g., in a bank lobby or airport terminal) to avoid machines modified by criminals to skim/video your card data or where you might be robbed after use.  Ensure early in usage that the ATM supports a language you understand. For a full discussion of safe/effective charge/debit/ATM card usage and their cost trade-offs, see also [[Money]]. They will charge you a usage fee on top of anything your bank charges you which should be declared on the screen before you proceed (2,90\\u20ac for a 500\\u20ac withdrawal as of Oct. 2024 across different banks).\\n\\n===Areas of caution===\\n\\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (''cercanias'' in Spanish or ''rodalies'' in Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\\n\\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montju\\u00efc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\\n\\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\\n\\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\\n\\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\\n\\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\\n\\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.\\n\\n===Anti-tourism movement===\\n\\nMany Barcelona residents have the impression that there are too many tourists in Barcelona and that it has increased living costs, as landlords prefer to rent to tourists and not to locals to make more profit. Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024.\\n\\n===Cars===\\n\\nTourist drivers may attract special attention, such as [[common scams#Red light bag snatch|Red light bag snatch]] or [[common scams#Flat tire|Flat tire scams]]\\n\\n===Public transportation===\\n\\nBesides being a particular pickpocket hot spot, there are plenty of fare evaders who will stick to you when crossing a fare barrier. Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean ''carte blanche'' for them. The fare evasion fine is just \\u20ac50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome.\\n\\n===Reporting crimes===\\n\\nIf you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers generally do not speak English, even though the theft report form is in English, Spanish, and Catalan. The police station most often used to report theft is the one underneath Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya beside metro station, where they have some translators for common languages.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n===Hospitals===\\nEU citizens can get free or reduced cost medical treatment on presentation of an EHIC card and passport.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Hospital Clinic I Provincial De Barcelona | url= | email=\\n| address=C/ Villarroel 170 | lat= | long= | directions=Metro Stn Hospital Clinic (Line 5)\\n| phone=+34 932 275 400 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===Consulates===\\n\\n{|\\n|-\\n| style=\\\"vertical-align:top;width:50%;\\\" |\\n* {{flag|Angola}} {{listing\\n| name=Angola | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer del Consell de Cent, 413-415 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 245 02 73 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Argentina}} {{listing\\n| name=Argentina | url=http://cbarc.mrecic.gov.ar/en | email=\\n| address=Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia, 11 (08007) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 304 12 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Australia}} {{listing\\n| name=Australia | url=http://spain.embassy.gov.au/madr/home.html | email=ausconbcn@gmail.com\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 433 Bis, Second Floor, Door 1 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 362 3792 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Austria}} {{listing\\n| name=Austria | url= | email=barcelona@consuladodeaustria.com\\n| address=Carrer de Mari\\u00e0 Cub\\u00ed, 7 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 368 60 03 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bangladesh}} {{listing\\n| name=Bangladesh | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Londres, 35 (08029) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 410 83 89 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belgium}} {{listing\\n| name=Belgium |alt=| url=http://www.diplomatie.be/barcelonafr/default.asp?id=31&mnu=31 | email=barcelona@diplobel.fed.be\\n| address=Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 680 (08010) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 80 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n|wikidata=|lastedit=2020-08-05| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belize}} {{listing\\n| name=Belize | url= | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 469 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 430 30 44 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Benin}} {{listing\\n| name=Benin | url=http://www.consuladobenin.com/ | email=consuladobenein@terra.es\\n| address=Carrer d'Arag\\u00f3, 290 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bolivia}} {{listing\\n| name=Bolivia | url=http://consuladodeboliviaenbarcelona.es/ | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Roger de Flor, 3 (08018) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 322 65 12 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Brazil}} {{listing\\n| name=Brazil | url=http://www.brasilbcn.org/ | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 468 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 488 22 88 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bulgaria}} {{listing\\n| name=Bulgaria | alt= | url=https://www.mfa.bg/es/embassies/spain-barcelona | email=Consulate.Barcelona@mfa.bg\\n| address=Avinguda de la Riera de Cassoles, 54 (08012) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 937 969 950 | tollfree= | fax=+34 937 969 949\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Burkina Faso}} {{listing\\n| name=Burkina Faso | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Muntaner, 261 (08021) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 93 200 99 09 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Canada}} {{listing\\n| name=Canada | url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/spain-espagne/offices-bureaux/consul_barcelona.aspx | email=bclna@internacional.gc.ca\\n| address=Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, 9 (08002) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 412 72 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|France}} {{listing\\n| name=France | url=http://www.consulfrance-barcelone.org/ | email=info@consulfrance-barcelone.org\\n| address=Ronda Universitat 22 bis -

(An eleven mile hike, with some decent elevation gain: Take train to Castelldefels station, head up to Castel de Castelldefels, follow trail about 5 miles to La Morella, where you can take in some great views. Trace your steps back half a mile, then continue southwest towards Playa Garraf. Playa Grarraf is right by the Garraf train station, allowing easy access back to Barcelona.)\\n*[[Pyrenees]] - A mountain range around {{km|150}} north from the city.\\n*[https://www.visitsantcugat.cat/en/ Sant Cugat del Valles] - Has one of the most interesting Romanesque cloisters in Catalunya, with many interesting carvings.

The area was originally meant to be a residential property development with Gaudi doing much of the planning and landscape design. Only two houses were built and the land was later sold to the city of Barcelona and turned into a park. There are two areas -- a relatively undeveloped (and un-crowded) natural area near the top of the hill and the more famous sculpture park below. The top of the park offers panoramic views of Barcelona, while the sculpture portion is full of walkways and other structures exhibiting the distinct and colourful style of Gaudi, including the famous terrace and fountains near the main entrance. You are strongly advised to buy tickets days in advance. Don't expect to be able to buy one on the day. Be patient when exploring the site, as once you enter the Natural Plaza where crowds gather, you are confined to a one-way path that you must traverse before backtracking if you want to return to higher ground.

It borders the iconic Pebble Beach golf course and is the entry point to the 17-Mile Drive and its dramatic ocean views. Note that the 17-mile-drive has a toll as well.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Monterey (California)|Monterey]]|wikidata=Q487315}} - Founded in 1770, Monterey was the capital of Alta California under both Spain and Mexico, was a bustling fishing port until the 1950s, and is now a major tourist destination.  Attractions include a pier filled with seafood restaurants, a world-class aquarium, a harbor that is home to an enormous number of seabirds, sea lions, sea otters, seals, and other marine life, the historic Cannery Row, and opportunities for [[whale watching]], kayaking, or other excursions into Monterey Bay.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Morro Bay]]|wikidata=Q605491}} - This coastal town is best known for the massive 581-foot (177-m) tall volcanic rock that dominates its harbor, but is also a great spot to see marine mammals and is home to one of California's oldest fine art and craft shows.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Paso Robles]]|wikidata=Q586528}} - Paso Robles is a historical resort town known for its hot springs. This city's major industry is wine production, with vineyards located throughout the surrounding area.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Pismo Beach]]|wikidata=Q570287}} - This tourism-focused coastal town has more than 65 restaurants and 30 lodging options, and draws visitors with its beautiful coastline, annual clam festival, and the thousands of monarch butterflies that gather to spend the winter in a grove at the edge of town.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[San Luis Obispo]]|wikidata=Q49012}} - Lying almost exactly half way between [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]], this small college town and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing, outstanding natural beauty, a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission, a small but thriving art gallery scene, and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Santa Barbara]]|wikidata=Q159288}} - The \\\"American Riviera\\\" is a historic mission city that is an incredibly popular getaway destination.  Its wide beaches, highly rated wineries, luxurious resorts, art galleries, and a large variety of excellent dining choices, enable the town of just 90,000 residents to enjoy the sort of cultural and social amenities which are usually found only in much larger cities.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Santa Cruz (California)|Santa Cruz]]|wikidata=Q159232}} - Santa Cruz is best known as a countercultural hub, with a fun bohemian feel and youthful vibe, and weekend tourist attractions like the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, a historic mission, and the dubious Mystery Spot. The beaches north and south of Santa Cruz are considered some of the more pristine areas of natural beauty in central California, and while conditions generally make them impractical for swimming, several are considered an expert surfer's cold cold paradise.\\n\\n==Other destinations==\\n[[File:Carizzo plain spring flowers in bloom 5.jpg|thumb|300px|Spring wildflowers can be spectacular after a wet winter in the remote Carrizo Plain National Monument.]]\\n\\n* {{marker|type=vicinity|name=[[Big Sur]]|wikidata=Q859413}} - The Big Sur region can be loosely defined as the stretch of coastline between Carmel and San Simeon, and the steep cliffs, rocky coast, churning waves, abundant wildlife, redwoods, and remoteness make it one of the most beautiful drives in the world.  Big Sur Village lies at its heart and offers amenities for travelers.\\n* {{marker|type=vicinity|name=[[Carrizo Plain National Monument]]|wikidata=Q1045112}} - This remote national monument is home to the largest remaining native grassland in California. During wet years it boasts spectacular wildflowers in the spring, and Soda Lake is an important wintering area for waterfowl when precipitation is sufficient to flood the seasonal lakebed. The park is also home to Painted Rock, a Native American site that has been adorned with pictographs over thousands of years. Services are extremely limited, with just a small visitor center, two primitive campgrounds, and a handful of marked trails available.\\n* {{marker|type=vicinity|name=[[Channel Islands National Park]]|wikidata=Q306193|lat=34.0489|long=-119.5627}} - The Ventura harbor is the departure point for most excursions to the Channel Islands National Park, a series of islands that are home to incredible marine life, beautiful and rugged scenery, and the housecat-sized island fox.  The islands are remote with very limited services, attracting hikers, backpackers and scuba divers to explore both the above and below-water wilderness.\\n* {{marker|type=vicinity|name=[[Pinnacles National Park]]|wikidata=Q1783768}} - Rising out of the chaparral-covered Gabilan Mountains, east of central California's Salinas Valley, are the spectacular remains of an ancient volcano. Massive monoliths, spires, sheer-walled canyons and talus passages define millions of years of erosion, faulting and tectonic plate movement.  Hiking through the impressive rock formations is the primary recreational opportunity, although bird watchers will enjoy the possibility of seeing the highly endangered California condor.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Lone Cypress 17-Mile Drive 2013.jpg|thumb|300px|The iconic Lone Cypress on the 17-Mile Drive near Carmel.]]\\n\\nThe Central Coast includes some of the classic tourist country of California \\u2013 particularly the scenic version of the drive (or train ride) from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The Spanish colonialists traveled along the Central Coast along a route called [[El Camino Real]] \\u2013 roughly on the route of [[Pacific Coast Highway|Highway 1]] \\u2013 and created missions at Santa Cruz, San Juan Bautista, Carmel, Soledad, Jolon, San Miguel, San Luis Obispo, Lompoc, Solvang, Santa Barbara, and San Buenaventura (Ventura). Depending on what you count as Central Coast, the area has about half of the state's missions.\\n\\nMuch of the Central Coast is agricultural, with an emphasis on crops that flourish in relatively cool, coastal climates \\u2013 such as artichokes and strawberries. Grape-growing, especially in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties, is now an important sector. The Santa Barbara County wine country was made famous in the movie ''Sideways''. Monterey County is a renowned wine region, with more than {{acre|40,000}} planted in premium wine grapes. Fishing was once an important part of the regional economy, but has receded greatly. There is oil production off the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, but activity is greatly below previous levels.\\n\\nTourism is a critical industry, particularly on the Monterey Peninsula and around Santa Barbara. The temperate Central Coast has also been known as a retirement area, particularly for people from Los Angeles.\\n\\nPopulation in the Central Coast is concentrated in a series of small to medium-sized cities, only two of which exceed 100,000. The cities include Monterey, fast growing Salinas (a few miles inland), Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara. Santa Cruz city and county are sometimes considered part of the Central Coast, but they have become increasingly tied to the [[Bay Area|San Francisco Bay Area]] and especially Silicon Valley (Santa Clara County), to which many Santa Cruzans commute. Ventura County, at the southern end of the Central Coast, is classified by the Census Bureau as part of the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area and is also a part of that city's media market, and commuter train service to LA is available.\\n\\nThe Central Coast has a large number of colleges, considering its relatively small population (about 2 million of California's 37 million). There are University of California branches at Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara, each of which strongly shapes the character of its city. California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) is the mainstay for the city of San Luis Obispo. There are newer state colleges at Ventura and at Fort Ord, a converted military base in Monterey County.\\n\\nThe '''Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary''' runs from north of the Golden Gate Bridge at San Francisco, to [[Cambria (California)|Cambria]] in [[San Luis Obispo County]], and is the largest marine sanctuary in the United States. It hosts spectacular kelp forests and wildly diverse marine life, and is popular for diving, kayaking and whale watching.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By car===\\nUS Highway 101 is the Central Coast's main artery and alternates between freeway and state highway throughout the Central Coast region.  Two-lane Highway 1, also known as the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] is the slower, more scenic option as it winds along the entire Central Coast coastline.\\n\\n===By plane===\\nThere are commercial airports near Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara (the largest), and Santa Maria. There are no flights within the Central Coast, only flights to and from San Francisco and Los Angeles.  It is usually cheaper to fly into adjacent regions, such as flying into the [[San Jose (California)|San Jose]] airport rather than the small Monterey airport, or [[LAX]] rather than Santa Barbara.\\n\\n===By train===\\nAmtrak's [https://www.amtrak.com/routes/coast-starlight-train.html Coast Starlight] train runs nearly the entire length of the Central Coast once each day, from approximately late morning to early evening.  For a driving-free train vacation, you can fly into the San Jose airport, take a bus or taxi to the San Jose Diridon train station, and then go down the coast, eventually to Oxnard or beyond the Central Coast to Los Angeles.  If you want to stretch the trip out over several days, Paso Robles and Santa Barbara are convenient towns to stop in, as they have hotels within an easy walk of their train stations.\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara can be reached on Amtrak's [https://www.amtrak.com/routes/pacific-surfliner-train.html Pacific Surfliner], which runs to and from Los Angeles and San Diego several times each day.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n[[File:MissionCarmelSEGL2.jpg|thumb|300px|Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in Carmel, built in 1771 as the second of the 21 missions established by the Spanish in California.]]\\n\\nUS Highway 101 is a freeway virtually its entire length. It connects San Jose, Salinas, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Oxnard with Los Angeles. The Monterey Peninsula is a few miles to the west. Outside of the Monterey Peninsula there are few towns of any size off 101; Lompoc in Santa Barbara County is one.\\n\\nThe rail route essentially follows 101, which was built along the rail corridor. There is only one train a day \\u2013 the Coast Starlight \\u2013 that covers the whole corridor. The Pacific Surfliners to Los Angeles and San Diego go as far north as San Luis Obispo, there is more service from Santa Barbara south.

Nestled around two of these peaks is San Luis Obispo (\\\"SLO\\\", \\\"slow\\\", or \\\"San Luis\\\" to locals), a small college town that also is one of California's oldest communities. San Luis and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing; outstanding natural beauty; a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission; a small but thriving art gallery scene; and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.\\n\\n===Getting Oriented===\\nSan Luis Obispo is bounded by the imposing line of Cuesta Ridge to the northeast, the Irish Hills to the southwest, dramatic Bishop Peak to the northwest and Islay Hill to the southeast. The town clusters around the feet of the 1,000-foot (300-meter) Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white \\\"M\\\" (for Mission High School). Both locals and visitors frequently refer to Cerro San Luis as \\\"Madonna Mountain\\\" and a common misconception is that the \\\"M\\\" represents the surname \\\"Madonna;\\\" the famous Madonna Inn sits at the foot of the mountain and the city of San Luis Obispo negotiated public access to the peak with the Madonna family. Cal Poly sits hard against Cuesta Ridge (with its big white \\\"P\\\") and the downtown area runs from Cerro San Luis roughly toward campus around two parallel streets, Higuera and Monterey. Most restaurants, bars and shops are located on Higuera Street, nearer the Mission and Cerro San Luis; hotels are mostly located on Monterey Street, nearer the university but still within a mile (2 km) of the central downtown. A few restaurants are located in the charming Railroad District, about 5 blocks east of Higuera via Santa Rosa Street, near the train station and youth hostel.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Visitors Center | alt= | url=http://visitslo.com/ | email=visitorcenter@slochamber.org\\n| address=895 Monterey St. | lat= | long= | directions=in the same building as the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, on the corner of Morro and Monterey Streets in the heart of downtown\\n| phone=+1 805 781-2777 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Su-W 10AM-5PM; Th-Sa 10AM-7PM | price=\\n| content=The Visitor Center offers San Luis Obispo city maps, visitor guides, books about San Luis Obispo, and San Luis Obispo souvenirs.

The Santa Lucia mountains and the \\\"Nine Sisters\\\" offer many beautiful views of the city and the countryside. The two most popular hikes are Bishop Peak (no bikes allowed) and Cerro San Luis (multiple biking trails). If you're interested in other mountain biking trails around the county check out the list at [http://cccmb.org/ CCCMB], a volunteer organization that creates and maintains trails countywide.\\n*Visit '''Montana de Oro State Park'''. Take Los Osos Valley Road {{convert|10|miles}} west of town to a park named one of the state's best-kept secrets by the L.A. Times a few years back, and with good reason; it's filled with an abundance of hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails both along the ocean along the bluffs and inland into the coastal peaks; a dramatic cove with caves that kids and adults love; and miles of sandy beach and tidal pools. Trails range from casual ambles along the bluffs to the steep climbs up Valencia and Oats Peaks. Oats is the longer hike (about 5.5 miles / 9 km) but more rewarding, as it offers views of Valencia against the Pacific, as well as northward and eastward to the Nine Sisters and Cuesta Ridge; the trail also is less steep. A terrific nine-mile (14-km) loop can be made by continuing over the summit to the Coon Creek trail, then crossing back in front of the range along Rattlesnake Flats Trail. Take water! The \\\"Mountain of Gold\\\" also reigns as a popular out-and-back destination for the many road cyclists in the county, but cyclists ride westward early as strong winds pick up through Los Osos Valley in the early afternoon.\\n*Walk or bike to '''Poly Canyon'''. Located on the north east side of the Cal Poly campus. Poly Canyon is a hilly, open, grassy area where many Cal Poly engineering and architecture students have constructed senior projects. The road up can be reached by taking the main road towards the Poly Canyon Village housing complex and taking a right before the road dips down the hill on a smaller road with a gate that quickly turns to dirt/gravel. Public vehicles are not allowed to drive on it, though be alert for university vehicles travelling up and down on occasion and student runners/cyclists.\\n* Kayaks and other outdoor gear can be rented at reasonable prices by students and the public from '''Poly Escapes''' on the Cal Poly campus. Kayaking is possible in many places in the county, but the most exciting place to kayak is between Shell Beach and Pismo Beach where there are sea caves you can explore.

Note that the 17-mile-drive has a toll as well.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Monterey (California)|Monterey]]|wikidata=Q487315}} - Founded in 1770, Monterey was the capital of Alta California under both Spain and Mexico, was a bustling fishing port until the 1950s, and is now a major tourist destination.  Attractions include a pier filled with seafood restaurants, a world-class aquarium, a harbor that is home to an enormous number of seabirds, sea lions, sea otters, seals, and other marine life, the historic Cannery Row, and opportunities for [[whale watching]], kayaking, or other excursions into Monterey Bay.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Morro Bay]]|wikidata=Q605491}} - This coastal town is best known for the massive 581-foot (177-m) tall volcanic rock that dominates its harbor, but is also a great spot to see marine mammals and is home to one of California's oldest fine art and craft shows.\\n* {{marker|type=city|name=[[Paso Robles]]|wikidata=Q586528}} - Paso Robles is a historical resort town known for its hot springs.

The Spanish colonialists traveled along the Central Coast along a route called [[El Camino Real]] \\u2013 roughly on the route of [[Pacific Coast Highway|Highway 1]] \\u2013 and created missions at Santa Cruz, San Juan Bautista, Carmel, Soledad, Jolon, San Miguel, San Luis Obispo, Lompoc, Solvang, Santa Barbara, and San Buenaventura (Ventura). Depending on what you count as Central Coast, the area has about half of the state's missions.\\n\\nMuch of the Central Coast is agricultural, with an emphasis on crops that flourish in relatively cool, coastal climates \\u2013 such as artichokes and strawberries. Grape-growing, especially in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties, is now an important sector. The Santa Barbara County wine country was made famous in the movie ''Sideways''. Monterey County is a renowned wine region, with more than {{acre|40,000}} planted in premium wine grapes. Fishing was once an important part of the regional economy, but has receded greatly. There is oil production off the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, but activity is greatly below previous levels.\\n\\nTourism is a critical industry, particularly on the Monterey Peninsula and around Santa Barbara. The temperate Central Coast has also been known as a retirement area, particularly for people from Los Angeles.\\n\\nPopulation in the Central Coast is concentrated in a series of small to medium-sized cities, only two of which exceed 100,000. The cities include Monterey, fast growing Salinas (a few miles inland), Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara. Santa Cruz city and county are sometimes considered part of the Central Coast, but they have become increasingly tied to the [[Bay Area|San Francisco Bay Area]] and especially Silicon Valley (Santa Clara County), to which many Santa Cruzans commute. Ventura County, at the southern end of the Central Coast, is classified by the Census Bureau as part of the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area and is also a part of that city's media market, and commuter train service to LA is available.\\n\\nThe Central Coast has a large number of colleges, considering its relatively small population (about 2 million of California's 37 million). There are University of California branches at Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara, each of which strongly shapes the character of its city. California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) is the mainstay for the city of San Luis Obispo. There are newer state colleges at Ventura and at Fort Ord, a converted military base in Monterey County.\\n\\nThe '''Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary''' runs from north of the Golden Gate Bridge at San Francisco, to [[Cambria (California)|Cambria]] in [[San Luis Obispo County]], and is the largest marine sanctuary in the United States. It hosts spectacular kelp forests and wildly diverse marine life, and is popular for diving, kayaking and whale watching.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By car===\\nUS Highway 101 is the Central Coast's main artery and alternates between freeway and state highway throughout the Central Coast region.  Two-lane Highway 1, also known as the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] is the slower, more scenic option as it winds along the entire Central Coast coastline.\\n\\n===By plane===\\nThere are commercial airports near Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara (the largest), and Santa Maria. There are no flights within the Central Coast, only flights to and from San Francisco and Los Angeles.  It is usually cheaper to fly into adjacent regions, such as flying into the [[San Jose (California)|San Jose]] airport rather than the small Monterey airport, or [[LAX]] rather than Santa Barbara.\\n\\n===By train===\\nAmtrak's [https://www.amtrak.com/routes/coast-starlight-train.html Coast Starlight] train runs nearly the entire length of the Central Coast once each day, from approximately late morning to early evening.  For a driving-free train vacation, you can fly into the San Jose airport, take a bus or taxi to the San Jose Diridon train station, and then go down the coast, eventually to Oxnard or beyond the Central Coast to Los Angeles.  If you want to stretch the trip out over several days, Paso Robles and Santa Barbara are convenient towns to stop in, as they have hotels within an easy walk of their train stations.\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara can be reached on Amtrak's [https://www.amtrak.com/routes/pacific-surfliner-train.html Pacific Surfliner], which runs to and from Los Angeles and San Diego several times each day.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n[[File:MissionCarmelSEGL2.jpg|thumb|300px|Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in Carmel, built in 1771 as the second of the 21 missions established by the Spanish in California.]]\\n\\nUS Highway 101 is a freeway virtually its entire length. It connects San Jose, Salinas, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Oxnard with Los Angeles. The Monterey Peninsula is a few miles to the west. Outside of the Monterey Peninsula there are few towns of any size off 101; Lompoc in Santa Barbara County is one.\\n\\nThe rail route essentially follows 101, which was built along the rail corridor. There is only one train a day \\u2013 the Coast Starlight \\u2013 that covers the whole corridor. The Pacific Surfliners to Los Angeles and San Diego go as far north as San Luis Obispo, there is more service from Santa Barbara south. [[Amtrak]] Thruway buses cover gaps in train service.\\n\\nGreyhound serves Santa Cruz, Salinas, King City, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, and Oxnard (but not Ventura), connecting to San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Regional and local buses fill in the gaps.\\n\\n==Go next==\\n* '''[[Southern California]]''' - Bordering the Central Coast to the south, the Southern California region is home to [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]], [[Disneyland]], and miles of famous beaches.\\n* '''[[San Joaquin Valley]]''' - Located east of the Central Coast, this area is the breadbasket of California and home to a large percentage of America's fruit and vegetable supply.

Prices start around $150 for a seat on flights that might already be going to your destination, or go from $1,000 to $10,000 or more for a custom-chartered flight where you hire the aircraft to fly you directly to your destination, any time you want to go.

South takes you to '''Los Alamos''', '''Buellton''', '''Solvang''', '''Santa Barbara''', and '''Los Angeles'''. Highway 1 is a scenic drive; taken northward it leads you through several small towns eventually connecting with 101 just past '''Pismo Beach'''. Taken south on Highway 1 after the split with 1 and 135 leads to '''Lompoc''' and Vandenberg Air Force Base and 135 leads to '''Los Alamos''' (which is 8 miles after the intersection with Harris Grade Road (the old California 1 south to Lompoc)). Highway 166 west takes you to Guadalupe and the coast, and east takes you to the great central valley of '''California'''. Highway 135 south takes you to Los Alamos (if the left exit at the gore point is used) or Vandenberg Air Force Base (if the right exit is used) and eventually connect with 101 at '''Los Alamos'''.

Nestled around two of these peaks is San Luis Obispo (\\\"SLO\\\", \\\"slow\\\", or \\\"San Luis\\\" to locals), a small college town that also is one of California's oldest communities. San Luis and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing; outstanding natural beauty; a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission; a small but thriving art gallery scene; and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.\\n\\n===Getting Oriented===\\nSan Luis Obispo is bounded by the imposing line of Cuesta Ridge to the northeast, the Irish Hills to the southwest, dramatic Bishop Peak to the northwest and Islay Hill to the southeast. The town clusters around the feet of the 1,000-foot (300-meter) Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white \\\"M\\\" (for Mission High School). Both locals and visitors frequently refer to Cerro San Luis as \\\"Madonna Mountain\\\" and a common misconception is that the \\\"M\\\" represents the surname \\\"Madonna;\\\" the famous Madonna Inn sits at the foot of the mountain and the city of San Luis Obispo negotiated public access to the peak with the Madonna family. Cal Poly sits hard against Cuesta Ridge (with its big white \\\"P\\\") and the downtown area runs from Cerro San Luis roughly toward campus around two parallel streets, Higuera and Monterey. Most restaurants, bars and shops are located on Higuera Street, nearer the Mission and Cerro San Luis; hotels are mostly located on Monterey Street, nearer the university but still within a mile (2 km) of the central downtown. A few restaurants are located in the charming Railroad District, about 5 blocks east of Higuera via Santa Rosa Street, near the train station and youth hostel.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Visitors Center | alt= | url=http://visitslo.com/ | email=visitorcenter@slochamber.org\\n| address=895 Monterey St. | lat= | long= | directions=in the same building as the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, on the corner of Morro and Monterey Streets in the heart of downtown\\n| phone=+1 805 781-2777 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Su-W 10AM-5PM; Th-Sa 10AM-7PM | price=\\n| content=The Visitor Center offers San Luis Obispo city maps, visitor guides, books about San Luis Obispo, and San Luis Obispo souvenirs.

The Santa Lucia mountains and the \\\"Nine Sisters\\\" offer many beautiful views of the city and the countryside. The two most popular hikes are Bishop Peak (no bikes allowed) and Cerro San Luis (multiple biking trails). If you're interested in other mountain biking trails around the county check out the list at [http://cccmb.org/ CCCMB], a volunteer organization that creates and maintains trails countywide.\\n*Visit '''Montana de Oro State Park'''. Take Los Osos Valley Road {{convert|10|miles}} west of town to a park named one of the state's best-kept secrets by the L.A. Times a few years back, and with good reason; it's filled with an abundance of hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails both along the ocean along the bluffs and inland into the coastal peaks; a dramatic cove with caves that kids and adults love; and miles of sandy beach and tidal pools. Trails range from casual ambles along the bluffs to the steep climbs up Valencia and Oats Peaks. Oats is the longer hike (about 5.5 miles / 9 km) but more rewarding, as it offers views of Valencia against the Pacific, as well as northward and eastward to the Nine Sisters and Cuesta Ridge; the trail also is less steep. A terrific nine-mile (14-km) loop can be made by continuing over the summit to the Coon Creek trail, then crossing back in front of the range along Rattlesnake Flats Trail. Take water! The \\\"Mountain of Gold\\\" also reigns as a popular out-and-back destination for the many road cyclists in the county, but cyclists ride westward early as strong winds pick up through Los Osos Valley in the early afternoon.\\n*Walk or bike to '''Poly Canyon'''. Located on the north east side of the Cal Poly campus. Poly Canyon is a hilly, open, grassy area where many Cal Poly engineering and architecture students have constructed senior projects. The road up can be reached by taking the main road towards the Poly Canyon Village housing complex and taking a right before the road dips down the hill on a smaller road with a gate that quickly turns to dirt/gravel. Public vehicles are not allowed to drive on it, though be alert for university vehicles travelling up and down on occasion and student runners/cyclists.\\n* Kayaks and other outdoor gear can be rented at reasonable prices by students and the public from '''Poly Escapes''' on the Cal Poly campus. Kayaking is possible in many places in the county, but the most exciting place to kayak is between Shell Beach and Pismo Beach where there are sea caves you can explore. There are guided tours of the so-called \\\"Dinosaur Caves\\\" available from several kayak rental shops in Pismo Beach.\\n*{{do\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Children's Museum | alt= | url=https://www.slocm.org/ | email=info@slocm.org\\n| address=1010 Nipomo Street | lat=35.278921 | long=-120.666103 | directions=\\n| phone=+1 805 544-5437 | tollfree=\\n| hours=Th-M 10AM-4PM | price=\\n| lastedit=2024-03-07\\n| content=Nipomo and Monterey.

For a multi-purpose capital, though, it's very small, with a permanent population of only 899 people (as of the 2016 census), who live on the shore of Hudson Bay, the bank of the Churchill River, and just past the treeline of the [[boreal forest]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n\\n===Origins===\\n\\nThe earliest inhabitants of the region were the Thule people, the proto-Inuit, who arrived around 1,000 BCE before moving north in search of colder pastures, leaving the territory principally to the Chipewyan and Swampy Cree aboriginal groups. See [[Indigenous cultures of North America]].\\n[[File:Churchill Wildlife Management Area polar bear10.JPG|thumb|320px|Polar Deadpan]]\\nThe first European camp here was a Danish expedition in 1619. The cold got to them; the three of 64 who survived the winter set sail for home as soon as the ice would permit.\\n\\nThe town as we know it finds its roots in the history of the Hudson's Bay Company, which in 1717 established a year-round trading post just north of the modern-day town across the Churchill River, joining in the [[In_the_footsteps_of_explorers#North_American_fur_traders|fur trade]] in northwest America, largely through deals with the tundra-dwelling Chipewyan.\\n\\nOwing to English worries about potential French aggressors, the post was moved south in the 1730s to a massive stone star fort, Prince of Wales, which is very visible from the town, being just across the river. In 1782 the French Hudson Bay Expedition arrived and captured the badly outnumbered civilian fort garrison without a shot, raided the supplies, but failed in the attempt to demolish this rather well constructed fort. The Governor Samuel Hearne, one of Canada's great explorers, returned the next year and set up shop once more. The same French expedition also took York Factory, 200km to the south, then the capital of the Hudson Bay Company and today uninhabited.\\n\\nThe trading post and river were named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (an ancestor of Winston Churchill), who was governor of the Hudson's Bay Company in the late 17th century.\\n\\nOver the centuries, the fur trade waned, and Churchill might have disappeared, were it not for the ambitious attempts by provincial governments to secure a northern port in central Canada (motivated by the desire to break the monopoly of the Canadian Pacific Railway on grain exports). After more than a decade of construction across the northern forests, the rail line from [[Winnipeg]] was finished in 1929, and the Port of Churchill would become the city's economic centre until wheat shipments began to decline in 2012. As grains could be transported less expensively by rail to [[Prince Rupert]] in the west or the Port of [[Montreal]] in the east, Churchill's seaport languished; the facilities were closed in 2016. The tracks were washed out in various places by May 2017 flooding; Denver-based Omnitrax (the owner of the port and railway at the time) refused to repair the damage, leaving Churchill severed overland until the line was sold in 2018. The new owners rebuilt the railway, and passenger trains resumed in December 2018.\\n\\n===The bears===\\n{{infobox|Bear Patrol|If we can't just shoot them, how to keep them from moving into town? It's a legitimate question (they are, after all, godless killing machines), and not one easily answered, but the people of Churchill have become incredibly sophisticated about it. If anyone spots a bear near town\\u2014and they get spotted quick\\u2014they call +1 204-675-BEAR (2327), and then the bear patrol comes out. Within a minute or two, a bunch of pickups topped with big spotlights will roll up to the coast and warn off anyone from walking in the area. They quietly monitor and encourage the bears to just move through, since tranquillizing poses two problems: 1. Drugged up polar bears tend to run off out of sight and fall asleep somewhere. 2. What do you do with a drugged up sleeping polar bear? The answer to number two is the most ingenious of all: put them in jail. <br><br>Yes, '''polar bear jail'''. It's a big old aircraft hangar by the airport with an awful lot of reinforced steel and some very angry 1200 pounders banging on the walls, who just couldn't be enticed to stay out of town. When the bay freezes over, the \\\"wardens\\\" tranquillize the bears inside and ''airlift them by helicopter'' about three river systems north of town, which is just enormous enough of a distance to keep the bears from walking right back to town. You'll know the bears that have been captured right away\\u2014not because of the tag on their backs, but because they break into an uncharacteristic sprint at the sound of helicopters!}}\\nThe Hudson's Bay Company traders were hardy folks, and presumably didn't mind living right in the middle of a major polar bear migration route. The problem of living just north of a giant polar bear colony was always solved rather neatly by shooting any bears wandering into town with shotguns.\\n\\nStarting around the 1960s, non-locals started taking an interest in the bears, in studying them, photographing them, and generally admiring the intense over-sized cuteness. Locals saw opportunity, stopped shooting the bears, and began the process of converting the town from a minor industrial centre to one of the world's northernmost tourist towns. Live polar bear webcams are operated by conservation group Polar Bear International with backing from Frontier North Adventures and [http://explore.org/channels/polar-bears/view-all/ explore.org].\\n\\nThe Western Hudson Bay bear colony is home to roughly 1,000 bears, which summer in Wapusk National Park. Polar bears hunt seals on the sea ice, but when the ice breaks up, they are forced to return to land where they fast until the ice forms again. Prime bear season is October and November leading up to the ice formation, when the colony heads north from the park (and towards Churchill) to get ready for the first freeze. While they wait, they snack intermittently on whatever is around. Kelp buried in snow seems to be a favorite. Things are kind of dull when the ice isn't in, so these curious animals will wander right over to you to give you a good sniff or taste. The taste bit is not a joke\\u2014polar bears' sense of taste is so powerful that you will see them regularly ''licking the air'' to discern what tastes are out there!\\n\\nThe bears are a threatened species, mainly due to human encroachment on their habitat. Canada has restrictions on [[hunting]] them, but does allow hunting by the native peoples and even some sport hunting for those who can afford $20,000 or more for an expedition. None of the allowed hunting is in the Churchill area.\\n\\n===The sea canary===\\n\\nBelugas, with their gleaming white skin, big smiles, and canary-like twitter, have every right to claim the title of world's cutest whale. The west Hudson Bay population, one of Canada's seven, comes back from its winters at the Arctic ice cap to roost, er, calf in the Churchill river bed. At this time, the river is ''filled'' with the whales and the zodiac boats are filled with tourists with expensive camera equipment! Up to ''3,000'' whales enter the river each summer.\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Metric\\n| janhigh =   -22.7\\n| febhigh =   -20.4\\n| marhigh =   -14.5\\n| aprhigh =   -5\\n| mayhigh =   3.2\\n| junhigh =   11.4\\n| julhigh =   17.3\\n| aughigh =   16.3\\n| sephigh =   8.8\\n| octhigh =   1.1\\n| novhigh =   -8.0\\n| dechigh =   -18.8\\n| janlow =   -30.7\\n| feblow =   -28.9\\n| marlow =   -24.4\\n| aprlow =   -14.5\\n| maylow =   -4.6\\n| junlow =   1.7\\n| jullow =   6.8\\n| auglow =   7.2\\n| seplow =   2.5\\n| octlow =   -4.5\\n| novlow =   -16.1\\n| declow =   -26.8\\n| janprecip =  14.8\\n| febprecip =  12.1\\n| marprecip =  18.2\\n| aprprecip =  23.1\\n| mayprecip =  27.3\\n| junprecip =  43.0\\n| julprecip =  54.6\\n| augprecip =  61.7\\n| sepprecip =  53.3\\n| octprecip =  43.7\\n| novprecip =  31.4\\n| decprecip =  18.3\\n| jansun =  7:25\\n| febsun =  9:52\\n| marsun =  12:17\\n| aprsun =  14:57\\n| maysun =  17:17\\n| junsun =  18:25\\n| julsun =  17:21\\n| augsun =  14:59\\n| sepsun =  12:21\\n| octsun =  9:48\\n| novsun =  7:23\\n| decsun =  6:15\\n| description =\\n}}\\n\\n===Climate===\\n\\nThe ''[[Northern Lights|Aurora Borealis]]'' is another good thing to keep tabs on:\\n\\n'''Bears''' can be seen year-round. But the one time of year where they really are everywhere is '''October\\u2013November''', before the sea ice forms. At that time of year, you can feel pretty confident that you will have plenty of photography opportunities every time you go out in a tundra vehicle. At other times, you have to wonder whether you are spending a small fortune on transport to see no bears. November is the really snowy month, so expect worse weather, less sunlight, way colder temperatures, but more pretty snow-covered backdrops for bears to play around in. While the sea ice is a bit unpredictable, it's fairly safe to assume that the last week of bear season is more or less the second to last week of November. Beyond that, you could miss them (and the tundra vehicles stop running anyway).\\n\\n[[File:Cape Churchill fast ice4.JPG|thumb|260px|Shore-fast ice at Cape Churchill, Wapusk National Park]]\\n\\nThe '''belugas''' arrive in mid-June and depart in mid-August. So do the '''bugs''' (especially July). As cute as the belugas are, so are the flies as demonic a plague, so bring long pants, long sleeves, bug spray with DEET, and ideally a bug jacket for the possibility that it gets especially bad.\\n\\n'''Aurora season''' is January\\u2013March, as the nights are longest and the precipitation (ergo cloud cover) lowest. Given how bleak the deep winter months are in terms of cold and lack of animal activity, though, one might speculate that this \\\"season\\\", while ideal for aurora-watching, is a bit manufactured to stimulate tourism in the slow months\\u2014you can see it just fine in November if you have a good night. All you need is a clear dark sky (a new moon is ideal), and good space weather\\u2014if you time your visit to coincide with the peak of an eleven year solar cycle, you'll see more intense lights more frequently.\\n\\n===Prepare===\\n\\nIt's not easy to visit Churchill (during bear season) without going through a tour company, simply because the tundra vehicles often book up quickly and hotels are full; the train and planes ''can'' fill up; and both the buggies and hotels generally require full payment up front with no refunds. You must confirm availability of transport, lodging, and buggy at the same time and then ''immediately'' call them back to book all three. Otherwise you could find yourself stuck with a giant bill for a hotel with no way to get out on the tundra to see the bears, or a giant bill for a buggy with no lodging! Other activities (dog-sledding, car rentals, helicopter tours, etc.), are easy enough to book, even after arriving.\\n\\nOnce you have booked everything, it's time to buy a northern wardrobe:\\n\\n====Summer====\\n[[File:Churchill area map.png|thumb|500px|Churchill area ([[#Get in|see below for town map]]) ]]\\nThe summer poses one problem and that's '''bugs'''. Tiny no-see-ums, run-of-the-mill mosquitoes, hell-spawn big black biting flies, and everything in between. A dry summer could mean little to no bugs, but it's good to err on the side of DEET. June\\u2013August requires insect repellent with DEET. While not necessary, pre-treating some of your clothes with ''specialized'' DEET spray ''for clothing'' probably won't be something you regret. You will see tourists with bug jackets and screen hats, but that's really a little over the top. Light long pants and long-sleeved shirts are a must, though.\\n\\n====Winter====\\nThe '''cold''' in Churchill is spectacular.\\n\\nWhen you are this far north, you will need some serious winter gear November\\u2013March, and potentially in October. Avoid wearing cotton, as cotton gets wet and stays wet. Layers are key, but not enough to keep you warm without a good jacket. If you forgot something, try to pick it up at the Walmart in [[Thompson]], if you are taking the train.\\n\\n*Warm wool (or other warm non-cotton) cap, which fits tightly against your skull\\n*Parka/very well insulated jacket with hood (lined hood ideal)\\n*Protective ski goggles will be especially good for dog sledding, snowmobiling, snow shoeing, or just days with really heavy winds\\n*Waterproof boots, ideally rated for -40\\u00b0C (-40\\u00b0F) or lower. The ratings are often flat out lies, so make sure to consult with a sales person, and let them know just how cold it is where you are going. Avoid boots with rubber toes, as that rubber will freeze, making and keeping your toes very cold. Anything lined with animal skin or fur will be warmest and most comfortable, albeit very expensive.\\n*Long underwear. When in doubt, err on the side of more (merino-) wool.\\n*Wool/fleece pants & sweaters; non-cotton shirts. Moisture wicking gear is good.

Bring/buy the best you can. Digital cameras don't stand up well to the cold, but they will still work. But bring extra batteries and film (if your camera uses it). In the winter, keep back up batteries close to your body to keep them warm, and switch them out when your active battery in your camera gets killed by the cold. If your camera breaks, [[#Buy|Bazlik Jewellers]] can repair it. A long telephoto lens is generally required for wildlife photography; a good zoom lens may be enough but see [[Travel photography]] for a detailed discussion. A waterproof camera is a must if you plan to swim with the Beluga whales in the summer (a GoPro with a waterproof case can be great for video). Bring an extra memory card in case one fails (and the cold can help them fail).\\n\\nPhotographing the '''[[Northern Lights#Photography|aurora]]''' requires different equipment. You will need a camera that supports manual exposure (10 to 40 seconds), a fast, wide-angle lens (aperture f/2.8 or better), fast film (800 ASA or better), or equivalent ISO setting on a digital camera, a strong tripod to hold the long exposure in potential high winds, and ideally a cable release or self-timer to trigger shots without stirring the camera. Again, you will want multiple batteries to swap as they freeze. Insulating the tripod can save your hands from freezing. Do not use any filter.\\n\\nA '''laptop''' is a good idea, if only for uploading your photos, to keep your memory cards free to take more high-resolution shots!\\n\\n'''Binoculars''' are great for wildlife viewing.\\n\\nEspecially in the winter, you will have plenty of downtime, so books and cards/games can be nice to have.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[File:Churchill map.png|thumb|400px|The town of Churchill]]\\n\\nThere are two ways to get to Churchill: airplane and train.\\n\\nThe economy seats on the train make for four nights of uncomfortable sleeping, but are cheap. The expensive sleeper cars are much more stylish, and allow you to enjoy the long-distance train experience watching the ecosystemic change out the windows as you travel north. Or, you can catch the train into Churchill and then take a nice quick, painless flight back when you're weary of your travels.\\n\\nA viable solution for those who would like to get to Churchill faster, while not spending a lot of money is flying from Winnipeg to [[Thompson]], and then taking the train from there.  The airport in Thompson is not within walking distance of the train station, but there are plenty of bored taxi drivers to help you.\\n\\n===By plane===\\n\\n==== Airport ====\\n* {{listing | type=go\\n| name=Churchill Airport | alt={{IATA|YYQ}} | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=58.739167 | long=-94.066389 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Churchill Airport | image=Churchill Manitoba Airport.JPG | wikidata=Q2875820\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n==== Airline ====\\n\\n* {{Listing|name=Calm Air|url=https://www.calmair.com/|tollfree=+1-800-839-2256|lastedit=2022-04-25|content=A regional airline operating flights in [[Manitoba]] and [[Nunavut]].}} Travel time directly to Churchill from [[Winnipeg]] is 2.5 hours.  Calm Air also offers seasonal flights from [[Thompson]] a few times a week.\\n\\nIf you are connecting through Winnipeg to get to or from Churchill, allow plenty of time between flights. As you will have to leave the secure area, collect your baggage (if you have any), check in at the airline desk and go through security. Since the tiny Churchill Airport has no security screening, passengers arriving in Winnipeg exit straight into baggage claim.\\n\\n==== Ground transportation ====\\nThe airport is about a ten-minute taxi ride from town. Most hotels will pick you up if you ask ahead of time. Some package tours use chartered flights from Winnipeg, in which case the tour company takes care of all the logistics.\\n\\n=== By train ===\\n{{Seealso|Rail travel in Canada}}\\n* {{go\\n| name=Churchill Station | alt={{IATA|XAD}} | url=https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/stations/prairies-and-northern-manitoba/churchill | email=\\n| address=1 Mantayo Seepee Meskanow | lat=58.767778 | long=-94.174444 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Churchill station (Manitoba) | wikidata=Q3096230\\n| lastedit=2023-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=VIA Rail Canada | alt= | url=https://www.viarail.ca/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=+1-888-842-7245\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Via Rail | wikidata=Q876720\\n| lastedit=2022-04-07\\n| content=Operates a route two days per week between [[Winnipeg]] and Churchill with stops in [[Portage la Prairie]], [[Dauphin]], [[Roblin]], [[Kamsack]], [[Canora]], [[Hudson Bay (Saskatchewan)|Hudson Bay]], [[The Pas]], and [[Thompson]].

Taking the train to Churchill is much more affordable than flying, but takes much longer. Via Rail serves Churchill with its [http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/prairies-and-northern-manitoba/winnipeg-churchill Hudson Bay line] that begins in Winnipeg. From Winnipeg the train takes about '''38-48 hours'''. You have the option of staying in one of several different sleeper cars, or riding in economy class (depending on how much you want to pay) and trying to find two empty seats to cram yourself into for a miserable night's sleep. Economy supersaver (non-refundable) round-trip tickets run $220-330, while sleeper cars (with showers, couches, and actual sleep) cost $500-900. A two-person cabin runs $1250-1700 per person (prices as of April 2020). Sales for economy class, which can bring the fare down further are published on Via Rail's website every Tuesday (look for the large \\\"Discount Tuesday\\\" banner on the home page). Sales on sleeper tickets are available in a [http://www.viarail.ca/en/deals special section] of the website at all times expect during a general sale and can bring the price down to $500 return.\\n\\nYou cannot drink your own liquor on the train, nor can you smoke. The fines are astronomical! The train will be stopping often, though, and you can hop off at the stops for a cigarette break. The big break is in [[Thompson]], where you'll have two-five hours to get off, shop at Walmart and Safeway, and get a meal. There's even a little sightseeing to be had there, if you are creative.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora borealis2, Churchill, MB.JPG|thumb|260px|Northern lights shimmering and dancing above in November]]\\n\\nA good tip for you train boozers\\u2014if you order liquor and a mixer, the mixer is free, so if you bring some of your own mixers... free cokes! The little bottles of wine are decent too. During bear and beluga seasons there is a chef on the train preparing decent, if slightly pricey (free for those in sleeper) fresh meals. Outside of peak season the microwave meals served range from acceptable to disgusting. Most people on board plan ahead and bring food. Cheese, sausage, cracker, fruit, etc. platters are great. A dome car for passengers in sleeper class is usually attached during bear, beluga, and northern lights seasons.\\n\\n=== By car ===\\n\\nThere is no road to Churchill; however, you can drive to Thompson and pay to park your car there (try the Days Inn lot), and continue by train or airplane. The road to Thompson is lonely and subject to closure if a snowstorm hits, though.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n{{mapframe|layer=W}}\\nIt's quite easy to walk within the city limits on your own. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from one end of town to the other. It's also possible to rent a car in Churchill, and there are several taxi drivers who tend to hang out around the airport and train station.\\n\\nCar rental isn't at all popular with tourists, even the ones who aren't on package tours, but taking out an SUV is actually a great idea. If you think there's a good chance of seeing the aurora on a given night, rent a vehicle and drive it out of town at night! You'll be away from the lights of the town, and you'll have a mobile heating device/bear escape pod to keep you safe. If you have a day's worth of downtime from your various activities, you can just drive around the passable roads and go bird-watching, find the downed plane, head down through the woods to the observation tower, up to Cape Merry, or create your own wildlife photo tour. Expect the rental to run around $100 and the gas refill before returning to run around... $100 more.\\n\\n==See==\\n\\nBeyond the wildlife and landscapes, there is actually a fair amount of interesting stuff to see there. The historic [[Hudson's Bay Company]] settlements are perhaps the most interesting, but are impossible to visit during the winter months (and York Factory is hard to reach even when it's possible). Aside from Cape Merry, that is, which along with the Itsanitaq Museum is an easy and highly recommended sight to see. If you have a car and a free day, head south of the city to the observation tower and east of the city to see Miss Piggy up close.\\n[[File:Churchill Inukshuk en route to the port.JPG|thumb|260px|An ''inukshuk'' with the Port of Churchill behind, en route to Cape Merry]]\\n* {{see\\n| name=Cape Merry | alt= | url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/mb/prince/activ/merry | email=\\n| address= | lat=58.78871 | long=-94.19984 | directions=The northern tip of Churchill, past the port\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=Q22426630\\n| content=An old cannon battery was set up in 1747 to protect the Hudson Bay Company's business on the Churchill River, rather stupidly, as the cannons there could be captured by an enemy and used to fire upon Prince of Wales Fort across the river.

The initial settlement established in 1670 was at the mouth of the Nelson River just west, and moved to the present and extant site in 1684. Up until 1957 York Factory remained a northern trading post. Getting out there is not a simple affair, but can be done from Churchill as a day trip through Hudson Bay Helicopters (see [[#Do|below]]), for a rather steep price!\\n}}\\n\\n==Do==\\n\\nActivities are wildlife centric, and depend heavily on the season. During polar bear season everyone will head out in the tundra vehicles, while beluga whale season means the Churchill River will be filled with zodiacs and kayaks. Dog sledding can be done any time of the year, although the snowy months are more rewarding. Helicopter tours are pretty exciting any time of the year as well, but the aerial wildlife viewing is best late April through the end of bear season.\\n\\nAt the local post office, a novelty passport stamp is available to visitors for free during office hours to commemorate your visit, but this is not an official immigration stamp and could invalidate your passport.

Plan to spend two days out on the tundra during your trip during bear season (you absolutely will not regret it), and therefore $800 per traveller! Tours include a guide, and they are uniformly great (bring cash for a tip), as well as some tasty soup, sandwiches, sodas, coffee, and hot chocolate. '''Wear all your cold weather gear'''.

But it needs a caveat: you will spend very little time actually on a sled, and dog sledding involves little more than standing or sitting down and letting the dogs do the work. The true art of dog sledding is principally breeding and taking care of the dogs and secondarily logistics for trips. Also, during high season, expect to spend a lot of the time waiting around for your turn, as only two people can ride at a time!\\n\\n[[File:Churchill dog sledding2.JPG|thumb|260px|A late afternoon jaunt with some happy Canadian sled dogs]]\\n\\nSo why do the dog sledding activity at all?

The boat tours spend one-two hours on the water and then one more hour on the other bank to explore Prince of Wales Fort. The first is through Lazy Bear Lodge (see [[#Tundra buggies|above]] for contact information), which does a three-hour tour for $130 per person, but cannot be booked in advance unless you have a room with them, so a spot would not be guaranteed if staying elsewhere and setting up your trip independently.

Most tourists are not mentally fortified to jump into a cold, cold river filled with whales, but it is certainly the most up-close way to see the Belugas. Scuba diving is permitted, but there are no guides to take you, so only experienced divers, and you must bring your own equipment to Churchill. You can fill your tanks at the hospital. For snorkellers, though, the two boating tour companies above (Sea North and Lazy Bear Lodge) will set you up with a guide and dry suit or wet suit. Sea North snorkelling in wet suits is available July\\u2013August, three hours, $195/person, two person minimum.

Guides have permits to enter the park and can take you within 100 m to the bears. The denning areas in the wilderness are the best places to photograph mother polar bears with cubs. This is a bit of a professional wildlife photographer retreat, in fact, for other animals as well (in addition to some great aurora watching potential), such as foxes, wolves, ptarmigan, caribou herds, etc. The polar bear ecotourism experience is only in the denning season (Feb-March) which is also a great time for aurora viewing. Wat'chee does not have publicly available contact information, and you must submit inquiries through the form on their website.\\n}}\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n[[Cold weather]] is theoretically a danger, but you probably won't have an opportunity to get hypothermia, since most all excursions in the winter will involve a vehicle and a fair degree of supervision. '''Polar bears''' are a real danger, though. Be careful when walking anywhere on the outskirts of town, such as Cape Merry, by the ''inukshuk'' and the big wooden boat behind the town centre, or anywhere outside of town. In such areas close to town you will notice Polar Bear Alert signs \\\"Stop. Don't walk in this area\\\", and if you do see a bear in or near town, call the Bear Patrol immediately at +1 204-675-BEAR (2327).\\n\\nBecause of the dangers posed by polar bears, '''car doors are never locked''' in Churchill (don't ever lock your own if renting), and the quickest way to escape danger, if going indoors is not an immediate option, is to simply hop in a car and shut yourself inside. There hasn't been a bear-related death since 1980, but injuries have happened since, and even locals can get surprised by an itinerant bear now and then\\u2014stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\\n\\n==Stay healthy==\\n\\nBecause of Churchill's size and remote location, the services available at the hospital are limited. Individuals with serious medical issues may be transported to Winnipeg by air ambulance. The provincial government will cover most if not all of the cost of the evacuation for Manitoba residents, but not for other residents of Canada. Those coming from outside of Manitoba may or may not be covered by their provincial health plan or private supplementary plan. Visitors from outside of Canada [[Canada#Stay Healthy|should always purchase health insurance when visiting Canada]] unless they are coming on a visa that allows them to apply for provincial health insurance. As the cost for the flight to Winnipeg can exceed $10,000, plus the cost of a ground ambulance in Winnipeg and medical treatment in both Winnipeg and Churchill, insurance for visitors should have a high coverage ceiling.\\n\\n==Connect==\\nYou will have Wi-Fi wherever you stay, and nearly all hotels will have an available computer. There is LTE cell data service in town, which also extends to the airport, though don't expect it anywhere else outside of town.

As of Jan 2022, the park is on UNESCO's mixed tentative list along with the proposed Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area for its exceptional representation of the Arctic ecosystem.\\n[[File:Sirmilik Glacier 2 1997-08-06.jpg|right|thumb|Sirmilik Glacier]]\\n\\nThe park is seldom visited \\u2013 in 2022\\u201323, it only received a mere 6 visitors.\\n==Understand==\\nSirmilik National Park, nearest the town of Pond Inlet, covers an area of 22,200 km\\u00b2 (8,600 sq mi), which is larger than El Salvador.\\n[[File:Byam Martin Mountains 4 1997-08-05.jpg|right|thumb|Byam Martin Mountains]]\\n\\nSituated within the Arctic Cordillera, the park is composed of three areas: most of Bylot Island with the exception for a few areas that are Inuit-owned lands, Oliver Sound, and Baffin Island's Borden Peninsula. Much of the park is bordered by water.\\n\\nGeographically, it is representative of the Northern Eastern Arctic Lowlands Natural Region and parts of the Lancaster Sound Marine Region.\\n\\nIn the Inuktitut (or Inuit language), Sirmilik means \\\"place of glaciers\\\". As Canadian Arctic Inuktitut-speakers referred to northern Baffin Island as Sirmilik, the name of the geographic region became the name of the national park.\\n\\n===History===\\n\\nExtensive archaeological exploration of the park area has indicated that the area has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years. The earliest known are predecessors of the modern-day Inuit.\\n\\nThe area was explored by European whalers and by explorers in their search for the Northwest Passage. In the 1610s, the area was surveyed by British explorers William Baffin and Robert Bylot. They named several features of the area including Lancaster Sound and Bylot Island in 1616. It was 200 years before the next official attempt to find the Passage through this area. The expedition by the British explorer John Ross in 1818 confirmed the accuracy of Baffin's charts, but ended when he saw what he believed were mountains blocking the end of Lancaster Sound. The area was later thoroughly explored during an extensive aerial mapping program of Northern Canada by the Canadian Government which took from the 1930s until the late 1950s to complete.\\n\\nThe Byam Martin Mountains on Bylot Island were climbed by Pat Biard and then Ben Farris in 1954, including Mount Thule. In 1963 British explorer Bill Tilman traversed the island, but did not climb any of the larger peaks. In 1977, a Canadian expedition of Rob Kelly and others climbed 20 peaks of Bylot Island, and in 1984 Mike Schmidt with others climbed 28 peaks, including 16 first ascents.\\n\\nThe park was established as a bird sanctuary in 1965 and monitored by the Canadian Wildlife Service because of its seabird colonies. The area became a national park in 2001. Today, the area is inhabited by the Inuit who continue to hunt and fish as their ancestors did.\\n\\n===Landscape===\\n\\n[[File:Sirmilik National Park geography.jpg|thumb|right|300px|NASA image of the park with the three areas labelled]]\\n\\nThe park consists of three land and marine components. These are Oliver Sound, to the south of Pond Inlet, characterised by a long narrow fjord flanked by towering cliffs and glaciers, the plateau and river valleys of the Borden Peninsula and Baillarge Bay, and finally Bylot Island, characterised by its rough terrain with mountains, coastal lowlands, icefields and glaciers. Hoodoos are unique eroded formations on Bylot Island and the Borden Peninsula. Evidence shows that the area was scoured by the Laurentide ice sheet, a massive sheet of ice that covered hundreds of thousands of square kilometers at least 20,000 years ago.\\n\\nThe Borden Peninsula extends north for 225 km (140 mi) and is 64 km (40 mi) \\u2013 169 km (105 mi) wide. The northern area, including the Hartz Mountains, are composed of flat, dissected rock rising to over 914 m (2,999 ft) above sea level. Admiralty Inlet forms a western border, with Elwin Inlet also to the west, while Navy Board Inlet forms a border to the east, separating the peninsula from Bylot Island. Navy Board Inlet's coastal cliffs rise to 457 m (1,499 ft).\\n\\nBylot Island lies off the northern end of Baffin Island and has an area of 11,067 km\\u00b2 (4,273 sq mi). It is also one of the largest uninhabited islands in the world. While there are no permanent settlements, Inuit from Pond Inlet and elsewhere regularly travel to Bylot Island. An Inuit seasonal hunting camp is southwest of Cape Graham Moore. \\n\\nThe Byam Martin Mountains extend from east to west across Bylot Island and are an extension of the Baffin Mountains which in turn form part of the Arctic Cordillera mountain system. The highest mountain in the range is Angilaaq Mountain, 1,951 m (6,401 ft), near the island's centre. The Byam Martin Mountains are made up of Archean-Aphebian igneous crystalline rock and Proterozoic metasedimentary and metamorphic rock, such as gneiss. Sharp peaks and ridges, divided by deep glacier-filled valleys are typical features in the range and has been extensively modified by glacial erosion. Extensive glaciers dot the island including the Kaparoqtalik Glacier. Vertical cliffs along the coastline are made up of Precambrian dolomite. The island's north shore faces Lancaster Sound, a polar bear maternity den area, also noted for its high concentrations of marine wildlife. To the northeast of the park is Baffin Bay and to the south lies Pond Inlet and Eclipse Sound.\\n\\n===Fauna===\\nBeluga whales, seals, walruses, Peary caribou, Arctic foxes, Arctic hares and wolves are found in this park. Bylot Island is a migratory area for narwhals. Sirmilik is one of eight Canadian national parks that contains polar bears.\\n\\nA major seabird colony is located in the area of Baillarge Bay. Seabird colonies are also on Bylot Island which have a large colony and nesting area of greater snow geese. More than 70 species of birds have been recorded here, of which about 40 are known to breed. The park is known to be an important bird sanctuary. In 1965, Bylot Island enclosed within the park was also declared as a \\\"Migratory Bird Sanctuary\\\" in view of the large number of migratory birds in the area. A record 100,000 birds are reported to pass the park during summer months every year, and the large geese population of the island is known to constitute the most abundant herbivores of the island. On some of Bylot Island's rugged cliffs within the park, thousands of nesting birds can be found including 300,000 thick-billed murre and 80,000 black-legged kittiwake.\\n\\n===Flora===\\n\\nThe wetlands of the park (10% of the area) have abundant vegetation of water sedge (Carex aquatilis), white cottongrass (Eriophorum scheuchzeri) and tall cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium). Other types of grass include the Fisher\\u2019s tundragrass (Dupontia fisheri), the polar grass (Arctagrostis latifolia) and semaphore grass (Pleuropogon sabinei). In addition, several species of brown moss have been recorded. In the Arctic environment of the southern part of the island 360 species of plants have been documented, which are considered to have rare quality and productivity.\\n\\nVegetation in the upland (on hill slopes and terraces) which constitute 90% of southern drier areas of the park consist of forbs, such as Arctic heather (Cassiope tetragona), mountain avens (Dryas integrifolia), Arctic poppy (Papaver radicatum) and mountain sorrel (Oxyria digyna), grasses, such as polar grass (Arctagrostis latifolia), northern foxtail (Alopecurus alpinus), bluegrass (Poa arctica) and northern wood rush (Luzula confusa) and shrubs, such as Arctic willow (Salix arctica) and northern bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum).\\n\\n===Climate===\\n[[File:Kaparoqtalik Glacier 1 1997-08-06.jpg|right|thumb|Kaparoqtalik Glacier]]\\nIn the north of Baffin Island, there is a polar maritime climate which means long, cold winters and short, cool summers. The spring does not end until mid-June and the warmest period is late July and early August, with average maximum temperatures of 10 \\u00b0C. The coldest month is January as the average maximum temperatures of about \\u221230 \\u00b0C. Rainfall is relatively abundant, contributing to the flora seen in the park.\\n\\nThere is almost endless daylight from May to August, but the sun is absent from the sky December and January. Spring brings strong winds and late summer is often cloudy. In winter, loss of daylight and the presence of sea ice can make for extremely cold weather. Weather in the Arctic is notoriously changeable. Abrupt weather changes can affect sea and boating conditions forcing boaters to wait out rough waters, sometimes for several days. Be prepared for snow anytime, anywhere in Sirmilik. White-out conditions are possible any time of year.\\n\\n===Visitor information===\\n* [https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/nu/sirmilik Park website]\\nContact the park office {{phone|+1 867-899-8092}}, toll-free {{phone|+1-888-773-8888}}, or email: {{email|sirmilik.info@pc.gc.ca}}.\\n\\n==Get in==\\nPond Inlet and Arctic Bay, Nunavut are Sirmilik National Park\\u2019s gateway communities, accessible by 3-hour commercial flights from Iqaluit.

Most hikes on Bylot Island will take you to ancient glaciers. \\n\\n===Sea kayaking===\\nThe waters of Oliver Sound can be used for sea kayaking with a local guide or on your own.  Equipment rentals may be available in Pond Inlet.\\n\\n===Wildlife viewing===\\nBylot Island is a Migratory Bird Sanctuary managed jointly with the Canadian Wildlife Service. The island is a haven for seabirds, migratory waterfowl, \\nand other wildlife and has the largest colony of greater snow geese in the world. \\n\\nThe Baillarge Bay sea bird cliffs, near Arctic Bay, are home to thousands of thick-billed murres and black-legged kittiwakes best seen by expedition style cruise ships. \\n\\n===Skiing, mountaineering and glacier travel===\\nSpring (late March to early June) is the ideal time for ski touring and mountaineering here, especially on Bylot Island. \\n\\n===Floe edge tours===\\nThe most popular wildlife viewing is guided, spring floe edge tours where visitors may see narwhal, beluga whales, polar bear and many species of birds. \\n\\n===Boating===\\nIn the summer (late July to early September) Sirmilik is accessible only by water. The nearest community to Bylot Island is Pond Inlet, 25 km to the south, across Eclipse Sound. Local boat operators and guides are available in Pond Inlet or Arctic Bay to provide marine transportation to the park.\\n\\nTour operators must be licensed by Parks Canada to provide guiding and outfitting services inside Sirmilik National Park.  Contact the Parks Canada office in Pond Inlet at {{phone|+1 867 899-8092}} for a list of operators.\\n\\nTravelling by sea kayak is one way to experience Sirmilik for those who are very experienced and only in certain areas. Marine hazards include strong winds, adverse weather, floating ice, and tides. Boat transportation to drop-off and pick-up points is advised.\\n\\n===Marine points of interest===\\n\\n*'''Oliver Sound - Kangiqluruluk''': south of Pond Inlet, Oliver Sound features an immense scenic fiord with excellent opportunities for boating, sea kayaking, and camping. Its steep cliffs and valley glaciers provide some of Sirmilik's most impressive scenery, and its sheltered waters are ice-free relatively early in the summer season. Several large alpine glaciers come close to the sound, and are ideal places to explore. There are several good camping areas along the shore, and many opportunities for day hikes into the adjacent uplands.\\n*'''Lancaster Sound - Tallurutiup imanga''': This very large body of water between Devon Island and Sirmilik is one of the most productive marine areas in the entire Canadian arctic. It is home to abundant populations of seabirds, walrus, polar bear, and several species of seal and whale. It is also the eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage and an important route for marine transportation.\\n*'''Eclipse Sound - Tasiuja''': The main marine transportation route to Bylot Island, Navy Board Inlet and Borden Peninsula. It is often covered by pack ice until mid-summer, and travel can be dangerous due to strong winds, currents, and high waves. There is abundant marine life in the sound, including narwhals and polar bears. Spectacular icebergs add to the local scenery. Some become grounded in shallow waters, remaining in Eclipse Sound for several years before floating into Baffin Bay.\\n*'''Navy Board Inlet - Nalluata imanga''': The main access corridor to the park's Borden Peninsula, Cape Hay and Lancaster Sound. The scenery is impressive, and several glaciers descend abruptly to the shoreline just north of Low Point.\\n\\n==Buy, eat and drink==\\nThere are no facilities in the park. Bring everything you will need.\\n\\nFilter (<0.5 microns), treat (iodine or chlorine in warm water), or \\nboil your drinking water. \\n\\n==Sleep==\\n\\nThere is no lodging in the park. \\n\\nIf you are camping, practise [[leave-no-trace camping]].\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n===When to go===\\n*Late March to early June (spring): The best time of year for winter activities. Frozen oceans make it possible to travel from either Pond Inlet or Arctic Bay to the park boundary by snowmobile or dog team to start your trip.\\n*Late June to mid-July (break up): During ice break up, travel to the park is impossible. You can explore the areas around Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay.\\n*Late July to late September (summer): This is the best time for hiking and camping. Boat travel to the park is possible.\\n*October to early November (freeze up): This is the best time for hiking and camping. Boat travel to the park is possible. \\n*November to February (winter): Travel to Sirmilik National Park is not advisable at this time. Cold temperatures, near-constant darkness & access difficulties in early winter make winter travel unpleasant, dangerous and, often, impossible.\\n\\n===Hazards===\\n*'''Polar bears''' Polar bears are most active along the coast of\\nthe Borden Peninsula and along the north, west, and east coasts of Bylot Island. Be particularly cautious in March/April when females with cubs are emerging from their dens and July to October when the sea ice is gone and bears are forced ashore. For more information, speak with parks staff, read the Safety in Polar Bear Country pamphlet, and watch the \\u201cPolar Bears: A Guide to Safety\\u201d at the park office or request one [http://www.distributionaccess.com online]{{Dead link|date=March 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}.\\n*'''Foxes and wolves''' can carry rabies. Do not allow them to approach you. \\n*'''Birds and wildlife''' are inquisitive and opportunistic. They will scavenge food left out and raid caches that are not securely stashed. Make sure food and garbage is securely stored.\\n*'''Walrus or whales''' can be aggressive and easily upset a boat.

It covers an area of {{km2|20,885}}, a bit smaller than El Salvador. It was established in 2003.\\n\\nIts name relates to steatite found there: Ukkusiksalik means \\\"where there is material for the stone pot\\\" (from ukkusik, meaning pot or saucepan like qulliq).\\n\\n===History===\\nThe park is uninhabited now, but the Inuit lived there from the 11th century to the 1960s. Remains of fox traps, tent rings, and food caches have been discovered in the area. The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) had an operating trading post in the area from 1925 to 1947.\\n\\n[[Image:Qarmaq relicts 1996-07-29.jpg|right|thumb|Qarmaq relics, Tinittuktuq Flats (Wager Bay)]]\\n\\nLittle is known about Wager Bay's early history, as until the 19th century the area was inhabited by Inuit who traditionally passed down their history by word-of-mouth.\\n\\nThere is, however, a remarkable quantity of stone relics, mainly tent rings from Thule people, inuksuit, caches and shelters which provide evidence that the coast of Wager Bay has been inhabited for thousands of years. About 500 archaeological sites have been identified from Dorset culture (500 BC - 1000 AD), and from Thule culture (1000 - 1800) and the last two centuries.\\n\\nIn 1742, Christopher Middleton on his sailing ship ''Furnace'' was the first European to enter the fjord, which he could not leave for several weeks because of ice flow.\\n\\nHe named the bay after Sir Charles Wager, First Lord of the British Admiralty, and an inlet where he anchored Douglas Harbour after James and Henry Douglas, sponsors of his expedition. The Savage Islands nearby he named after \\\"savage Eskimos\\\" (wild Eskimos) he met there.\\n\\nMiddleton was not successful in his search for the Northwest Passage, and neither was William Moore with his sloop Discovery five years later. As the region was too remote and thought to be useless, the bay was not again recorded or visited for more than a century. In the 1860s, American explorer Charles Francis Hall's two-masted ship ''Monticello'' reached Roes Welcome Sound in 1864 while searching for John Franklin's lost Northwest Passage expedition of 1845 and had to overwinter at the mouth of Wager Bay.\\n\\nIn 1879, another American expedition led by Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka searching for John Franklin passed nearby Wager Bay by land. The region eventually became recognized when the fur trade started there at the end of 19th century.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Canadian government showed an interest in the Wager Bay region and sent geologist Albert Peter Low on Neptune in order to establish Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic north.\\n\\nAt nearly the same time, in 1900, the American whaler George G. Cleveland, working alone, established a whaling station near the entrance of the bay, that operated for the next four years. Despite his closure of the station, Scottish whalers for some time tried their luck to hunt marine mammals in the Wager area. Large iron harpoon heads and other remnants are still found on the Savage Islands.\\n\\nIn 1910, the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (precursor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) set up a police post at Wager Bay coast, near Savage Islands. A police boat wreck, in a small inlet on the southeast shore of Wager Bay is testimony to the brief presence of police there.\\n\\n[[Image:HBC Ford Lake 1996-08-01.jpg|right|thumb|Abandoned Hudson's Bay Company outpost, Ford Lake]]\\n\\nIn 1915, George Cleveland set up a temporary\\u2014and the region's first\\u2014trading post, near the mouth of Wager Bay. In 1919, Cleveland, now working for the HBC, again set up a trading post in the mouth of Wager Bay. It was transferring building materials for the establishment of the Repulse Bay HBC post. Sitting at a favourable location at the northern end of Roes Welcome Sound, this post became important for the company's intention to expand their business towards the north.\\n\\nAlongside these local activities, the Hudson's Bay Company, during the first years of the 20th century, made great effort to get the fur trade under control. They started to build up a large and dense network of posts from the barren lands of northwest Hudson Bay to the northern coast of the continent. According to those plans, a post at the outermost edge of Wager Bay should play a key role. That new post was meant to include the Ukkusiksalingmiut area to the Back River estuary, 250 km (160 mi) to the northwest, into the company's strategy, thereby, if ever possible, preventing commercial activities of competitors, Revillon Fr\\u00e8res, operating from their Baker Lake base. In the late summer of 1925, the two-masted schooner ''Fort Chesterfield'' entered the channel, and, following the advice of local Inuit, found a well-protected inlet in Tusjujak (now Ford Lake) to establish their strategic station.\\n\\nDuring the first years, things went quite well. Besides offering usual supply goods, the post supported the Inuit in general, and gave, as far as possible, medical assistance. Thus, it became a meeting point that allowed Inuit from distant camps to exchange news as well. In December 1929, 22 Inuit families were counted, 107 persons in total, camping in their igloos nearby. Soon later, fur trade stopped booming. Hudson's Bay Company changed their major post into an outpost in 1933 and entrusted an Inuk, Iqungajuq (Wager-Dick), with its management. He thereby got the chance to start his own business in the fur trade. Wager-Dick and his family lived in the post buildings and ran the outpost until 1946. The company was eventually successful with its strategy towards its competitor and bought Revillon Fr\\u00e8res in 1936.\\n\\nCatholic missionaries, Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, who passed by in those years set up a small mission on one of Savage Islands, but never had great success and withdrew, when the activities of Hudson's Bay Company ended by mid-1940s and the Inuit had migrated into communities.\\n\\nSome 30 years later, from 1979 to 1981, Inuit from Rankin Inlet tried to revive their former homeland, but without success. The area is now unoccupied by people, except for occasional visitors and local Inuit who hunt in the area.\\n\\n===Landscape===\\nTundra and coastal mudflats south of the Arctic Circle and the hamlet of Repulse Bay, from Hudson Bay's Roes Welcome Sound towards the western Barrenlands and the source of Brown River. The park surrounds Wager Bay, a 100 km (62 mi)-long inlet on the Hudson Bay.  \\n\\nAt Hudson Bay\\u2019s northwest corner, some 200 km (120 mi) northeast of Chesterfield Inlet, near the Capes Fullerton and Kendall, is the entrance of Roes Welcome Sound, which extends northwards between the Barrenlands of the Kivalliq Region (meaning: border of the land) and Southampton Island to Repulse Bay, where there is a settlement of that name, situated at the Arctic circle. Wager Bay is an inlet of Roes Welcome Sound, pretty much in its geographical centre, near Cape Dobbs.\\n\\nWager Bay is the core of the national park. Its entrance is a rather narrow bottleneck, it is more than 30 km (19 mi) long and approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) wide at its narrowest spot. The tides rise and fall up to 8 metres (26 ft) and currents are extraordinary and cause large accumulations of ice masses during most of the year, often preventing the passage of watercraft. During early summer the rising flood water washes large quantities of drifting ice and icebergs into the bay. These accumulate during ebb tide, close the bottleneck like a cork and may stay for hours or even days.\\n\\nIn some places, Wager Bay is more than 250 m (820 ft) deep. The fjord is up to 35 km (22 mi) wide and almost 200 km (120 mi) long, extending northwest into Kivalliq-Barrenlands. It reaches latitude 66\\u00b0, therefore some 40 km (25 mi) from the Arctic Circle.\\n\\nEven at its western end, tides are impressive, between Wager Bay and the 2-km (1.2 mi) wide Ford Lake (Tusjujak in Inuktitut), so-called Reversing Falls occur. \\n\\n===Flora and fauna===\\nThe region is home to such species as polar bears, grizzly bears, Arctic wolf, caribou, seals and peregrine falcons. Vegetation in the park is typical low tundra, with dwarf birch, willow and mountain avens. Scattered patches of boreal forest can be encountered in river valleys.\\n\\nThere are 16 species of mammals in the park. At Wager Bay\\u2019s south shore is a large polar bear denning area. Therefore, in July and at the beginning of August, polar bears can be observed, from a boat, on floes, on islands or swimming from close up. Caribou (''Rangifer tarandus'') and curious Arctic ground squirrels (''Spermophilus parryii'') come close to Sila Lodge. More rarely seen are the shy lemmings (''Lemmus sibiricus''). Due to their camouflage, Arctic foxes (''Alopex lagopus'') and Arctic hares (''Lepus arcticus''), are not easily spotted but are most likely seen when fleeing. Other animals seen occasionally include Arctic wolves (''Canis lupus arctos''), muskoxen (''Ovibos moschatus''), snowshoe hares (''Lepus americanus'') and wolverines (''Gulo gulo'').\\n\\nSeveral species of marine mammals can be seen in the park\\u2019s area: ringed seals (''Phoca hispida'') and bearded seals (''Erignathus barbatus'') live there in large numbers, and from time to time a walrus (''Odobenus rosmarus''), common seal (harbour seal, ''Phoca vitulina''), a beluga (''Delphinapterus leucas''), a narwhal (''Monodon monoceros''), or a bowhead whale (''Balaena mysticetus'') may appear in Wager Bay.\\n\\nOnly four species of fish have been reported: Arctic char (''Salvelinus alpinus''), lake trout (''Salvelinus namaycush''), lumpfish (''Cyclopterus lumpus'') and ninespine stickleback (''Pungitius pungitius'').\\n\\nBirders are able to observe up to 40 species.\\n\\nOn the one hand, the national park is a typical rocky tundra area, on the other hand, beneath algae, bryophyte and ''Lecanorales'' lichens grows a flora of 25 families of flowering plants. They are closely related to alpine flora, but different. \\n\\n===Climate===\\nThe prevailing climate is arctic-maritime; relatively little precipitation, low temperatures, and strong winds. It has North America's highest wind chill and largest snowdrifts. Due to this, the national park is considered to be \\\"high arctic\\\".\\n\\nA remarkable feature is that at the south shore of Wager Bay a steep mountain range, gorged by former glaciers, strongly influences the weather. Due to its proximity to Hudson Bay, drops in temperature and strong fog are normal during summertime, as blizzards are during early autumn. The bay is not completely free of ice before the end of July, although temperatures may range from cool to very warm between May and September.\\n===Visitor information===\\n* [https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/nu/ukkusiksalik Park website]\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Park office | alt= | url= | email=ukkusiksalik.info@pc.gc.ca\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1 867 462-4500 | tollfree=+1-888-773-8888\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia= | wikidata=\\n| lastedit=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n==Get in==\\nThe park can be reached from the nearest communities of Baker Lake or Repulse Bay by plane or boat.

Akungiqtautitalik is not open to visitors.\\n\\nIn 1925, a Hudson\\u2019s Bay Company trading post was set up at the head of Wager Bay above an area of reversing tidal falls, to take advantage of inland trade potential and additional  trade routes. It is significant as being the first post ran by an Inuit manager. Old  buildings remain on-site as relics of this era.\\n\\nSeveral of these sites may be visited with a licensed operator. If you wish to visit the old trading post, ask if Parks Canada staff are available to accompany you. \\n\\n==Do==\\nUsually, the park can only be visited during a very few summer weeks, from the beginning of July until the beginning of August. Before that, Wager Bay has too much ice to be visited by boat, and in the autumn the Inuit say: \\\"During summertime, you may watch polar bears. Afterwards, they will watch you!\\\"\\n\\nThe place can be reached by a hired plane \\u2013 usually one would depart from Baker Lake, about 350 km (220 mi) away, where scheduled flights arrive from Rankin Inlet. One can also approach by motorboat from Repulse Bay, where Parks Canada runs a station, but due to possible problems with ice this might take longer and therefore will only be considered by explorers or movie teams who have to bring a lot of equipment.\\n\\nThe only air strip in the park is at the Sila River on Wager Bay's north coast. In 1987, Inuit from the area built Sila Lodge at this location. The lodge was opened for a few weeks during the summertime to allow nature enthusiasts to stay in the area. Due to the high cost of the flights, the lodge has been little used since 2002. From Sila Lodge, guided tours were offered, for instance boating tours to the Wager Bay islands, or to Ford Lake across the reversing falls, to the former Hudson's Bay Company outpost, or walks to the surrounding area, where you would find impressive relics of earlier settlements, such as tent rings, qarmaq and inuksuk.

The park is in the range of the Western Hudson Bay population of polar bears, which has remained stable at about 1000 bears.\\n\\nSea ice is the natural habitat of polar bears, and it's where they hunt  the ring seal, their major food source. In fall, from late September to November, many of the bears migrate along the coast to catch the first pack ice of the winter. The number of bears peaks in the areas around Cape Churchill in the park, and along the coast between the park and the town of Churchill.\\n\\nWhen the ice of the Hudson Bay melts in late July, the bears come ashore. While on shore, they gather along the coast and fast for about four months, until they can hunt seals again when the bay freezes.

A large part of the city, including the banks of the River Seine, is a [[UNESCO World Heritage List|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The city has the second highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants in the world (after [[Tokyo]], which is much larger) and contains numerous iconic landmarks such as the '''Eiffel Tower''', the '''Arc de Triomphe''', '''Notre-Dame de Paris''', the '''Louvre''', the '''Moulin Rouge''' and the '''Basilique du Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur''', making it one of the most popular international tourist destinations in the world, with around 14 million visitors annually. \\n\\n==Districts==\\nThe city of Paris is divided into 20 districts called ''arrondissements'', numbered from 1 to 20 in a clockwise spiral from the centre of the city (which is known as ''Kilom\\u00e8tre z\\u00e9ro'' and is located at the front of Notre Dame). ''Arrondissements'' are named according to their number. You might, for example, stay in the \\\"5th\\\", which would be written as ''5e'' in French. The 12th and 16th arrondissements include large parks: the ''Bois de Vincennes'' and the ''Bois de Boulogne'' respectively.\\n\\nThe very best map you can get for Paris is called \\\"Paris Pratique par Arrondissement\\\" which you can buy for about \\u20ac5 at any news stand.

Schematically, those to the west of Paris ([[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], [[Saint Cloud (France)|Saint Cloud]], [[Levallois]], [[Versailles]], Poissy, Rueil-Malmaison) are wealthy residential communities, even if some more middle class suburbs can be found. Those to the north are poorer communities, and very ethnically diverse. Those to the south are a mix of rough and poor neighbourhoods alongside very affluent communities. Finally, those to the east are usually lower-middle class mingled with a few upper-middle class communities.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nParis sits on the River Seine, in north-central France. Around 2.2&nbsp;million people live in the city of Paris, but this only represents the urban core within the ''Boulevard P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique''. There are some 10 million in the wider ''M\\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris'' (814 km<sup>2</sup>) and almost 13&nbsp;million people living in the metropolitan area, making this one of Europe's largest.\\n\\nDue to high expectations, a tight schedule, language barriers and large crowds and long lines at certain attractions during high season, the city might disappoint some visitors. Foreign visitors who have an idealized view of Paris might be shocked by the typical challenges of visiting any large city; crime, traffic noise, pollution, garbage, and relatively high costs. In the worst case, visitors might experience the ''Paris syndrome''; a psychological state of delusion.\\n\\nTo enjoy the wonders of Paris, make realistic plans. The amounts of attractions and landmarks is overwhelming; visiting only the most famous ones (which can be overcrowded during major holidays) takes more than a week. The city also has more to offer for people who take time for a calm stroll along the backstreets. If your time in the city is short, be selective, and save some attractions for your next visit.\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Paris je t'aime | alt= | url=https://parisjetaime.com/eng/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2024-01-30\\n| content=The website of the tourist office.\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=SPOT24 | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=101 quai Jacques Chirac, Paris 15th | lat= | long= | directions=Metro: Bir-Hakeim (line 6); RER: Champ-de-Mars\\u2014Tour Eiffel (line C); V\\u00e9lib': station 7023\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=Daily 10:00-18:00 | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2024-01-30\\n| content=The City of Paris welcome centre also has an exhibition and shop.\\n}}\\n\\n===History===\\nParis started life as the Celto-Roman settlement of ''Lutetia'' on the \\u00cele de la Cit\\u00e9, the island in the Seine now occupied by the ''Cath\\u00e9drale de Notre Dame''. It takes its present name from the name of the dominant [[Celts|Gallo-Celtic tribe]] in the region, the ''Parisii''. At least that's what [[Roman Empire|the Romans]] called them, when they showed up in 52 BCE and established their city ''Lutetia'' on the left bank of the Seine, in what is now called the \\\"Latin Quarter\\\" in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe Romans held out here for as long as anywhere else in the Western Empire, but by 508 CE they were gone, replaced by '''Clovis of the [[Franks]]''', who is considered by the French to have been their first king. Clovis' descendants, aka the Carolingians, held onto the expanded Lutetian state for nearly 500 years through Viking raids and other calamities, which finally resulted in a forced move by most of the population back to the islands which had been the centre of the original Celtic village. The Capetian Duke of Paris was voted to succeed the last of the Carolingians as [[Kingdom of France|King of France]], ensuring the city a premier position in the medieval world. Over the next several centuries Paris expanded onto the right bank into what was and is still called ''le Marais'' (The Marsh). Quite a few buildings from this time can be seen in the [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe medieval period also witnessed the founding of the Sorbonne. As the \\\"University of Paris\\\", it became one of the most important centres for learning in Europe\\u2014if not the whole world, for several hundred years. Most of the institutions that still constitute the University are found in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]], and [[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th arrondissements]].\\n\\nIn the late 18th century, there was a period of political and social upheaval in France and Europe, during which the French governmental structure, previously a monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy, underwent radical change to forms based on Enlightenment principles of nationalism, citizenship, and inalienable rights. Notable events during and following the revolution were the storming of the Bastille (in what is now the [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissement]]), and the rise and fall of Napoleonic France. Out of the violent turmoil that was the French Revolution, sparked by the still known ''Passion des Fran\\u00e7ais'', emerged the enlightened modern day France.\\n\\nThe Paris of today was built long after the Capetian and later the Bourbon Kings of France made their mark on Paris with the ''Louvre'' and the ''Palais Royal'', both in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]. In the 19th century, Baron von Hausmann set about reconstructing the city, by adding the long straight avenues and replacing many of the then existing medieval houses, with grander and more uniform buildings.\\n[[File:Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|210px|The Eiffel Tower]]\\n\\nNew wonders arrived during ''La Belle \\u00c9poque'', as the Parisian golden age of the late 19th century is known. Gustave Eiffel's famous tower, the first metro lines, most of the parks, and the streetlights (which are partly believed to have given the city its epithet \\\"the city of light\\\") all come from this period. Another source of the epithet comes from ''Ville Lumi\\u00e8re'', a reference not only to the revolutionary electrical lighting system implemented in the streets of Paris, but also to the prominence and aura of ''Enlightenment'' the city gained in that era.\\n\\nThe twentieth century was hard on Paris, but thankfully not as hard as it could have been. Both world wars took a heavy toll on the city's inhabitants, but at least Hitler's order to burn the city was ignored by the German General von Choltitz, who was quite possibly convinced by a Swedish diplomat that it would be better to surrender and be remembered as the saviour of Paris, rather than its destroyer. Following the war, the city recovered quickly at first, but slowed in the 1970s and 1980s when Paris began to experience some of the problems faced by big cities everywhere: pollution, housing shortages, and occasionally failed experiments in urban renewal.\\n\\nHowever, post-war Paris enjoyed considerable growth as a multi-cultural city, with new immigrants from all corners of the world, especially ''La Francophonie'', including most of [[North Africa|northern]] and [[West Africa|western Africa]] as well as [[Indochina]]. These immigrants brought their foods and music, both of which are of prime interest for many travellers. Immigration and multi-culturalism continues in the 21st century with a marked increase in the arrival of people from Latin America, especially [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], and [[Brazil]]. In the late 1990s, it was hard to find good Mexican food in Paris, whereas today there are dozens of possibilities from lowly ''taquerias'' in the outer ''arrondissements'' to nice sit-down restaurants on the boulevards. \\n\\nNevertheless, Paris remains a French city; bistros, baguettes, high-end fashion, art, accordions, Hausmann architecture, and all the stereotypes (whether good or bad) of France are alive and well in Paris. People from all over France flock to Paris for work, study, partying, and everything in between. After all, this IS the capital of France, so anything pertaining to France can be found here.\\n\\nThe 21st century has also seen vast improvements in the general livability of Paris, with the mayor's office concentrating on reducing pollution and improving facilities for soft forms of transportation including a huge network of cycle paths, larger pedestrian districts and new metro lines. Visitors who normally arrive car-less are the beneficiaries of these policies as much as the Parisians themselves, although tensions and doubts have emerged over the actual benefits of those measures.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Metric\\n| janhigh =   7\\n| febhigh =   9\\n| marhigh =   12\\n| aprhigh =   16\\n| mayhigh =   20\\n| junhigh =   23\\n| julhigh =   25\\n| aughigh =   25\\n| sephigh =   22\\n| octhigh =   16\\n| novhigh =   11\\n| dechigh =   7\\n| janlow =   3\\n| feblow =   3\\n| marlow =   5\\n| aprlow =   8\\n| maylow =   11\\n| junlow =   14\\n| jullow =   16\\n| auglow =   17\\n| seplow =   14\\n| octlow =   9\\n| novlow =   6\\n| declow =   4\\n| janprecip = 54\\n| febprecip = 44\\n| marprecip = 49\\n| aprprecip = 53\\n| mayprecip = 65\\n| junprecip = 55\\n| julprecip = 63\\n| augprecip = 43\\n| sepprecip = 55\\n| octprecip = 60\\n| novprecip = 52\\n| decprecip = 59\\n}}\\n\\nParis has an oceanic climate with moderately cold winters and warm summers.

There are also a few local lines of high interest to tourists which are privately owned. All SNCF, Eurostar and Thalys tickets can be bought in railway stations, city offices and travel agencies (no surcharge). SNCF relies on travel agencies for selling tickets online, the main one being [https://www.sncf-connect.com/ SNCF Connect] and [https://www.thetrainline.com Trainline] (easier to use). You can also find tickets in online and physical travel agencies. You can book and buy tickets up to three months in advance. There are significant discounts if you book weeks ahead. Reduced ticket prices are different for each day and each train and can be used only on the train the reservation is for. Trains between Paris and south Germany (Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich) as well as the Marseille-Frankfurt TGV are jointly operated by SNCF and Deutsche Bahn, but each of the two operators will sell tickets at its own price! Make sure to check the price offered by each operator before you buy, or use Trainline since they automatically compare SNCF and DB prices.\\n\\n{{see also|Rail travel in Europe}}\\n\\nThere are a number of different kinds of high-speed and normal trains:\\n\\n* '''TER''': The regional trains (''Train Express R\\u00e9gional''); cheapest tickets, though prices are variable on the time of day of departure (and the day of departure as well). TER are sometimes slower, stopping at almost all stations. TER tickets bought at the train station are valid two months from the date indicated on the ticket, as long as you travel in the right fare period (\\\"p\\u00e9riode bleue\\\", the cheapest, \\\"p\\u00e9riode blanche\\\", for high-demand hours). There is no seat reservation, so arrive early enough or you may have to travel without a seat.\\n* '''Intercit\\u00e9s''': A bundling of the former ''Intercit\\u00e9s'', ''T\\u00e9oz'', and ''Lun\\u00e9a'' train categories. There are two kinds: the regular trains, which are priced the same as the TER and the trains you'll find yourself on if you have a [[Eurail]] or [[InterRail]] pass and don't want to pay extra for reservations, and the ''trains \\u00e0 r\\u00e9servation obligatoire'', which require a reservation and are priced differently from the regular ''Intercit\\u00e9s'' trains.\\n* '''Intercit\\u00e9s de nuit''': Overnight trains from destinations to and from south of France, including [[Latour-de-Carol]], [[Lourdes]] and [[Cerb\\u00e8re]] via [[Toulouse]].\\n* '''TGV''': The world-famous French high-speed trains (''Trains \\u00e0 Grande Vitesse'') run very frequently to the southeast [[Nice]] (5-6 hr), Marseille (3 hr) and [[Avignon]] (2.5 hr), the east [[Geneva]] (3hr) or [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], [[Dijon]] (1 hr 15 min) and [[Strasbourg]] (1 hr 45 min), the southwest [[Bordeaux]] (3 hr), the west [[Rennes]] (2 hr) and the north [[Lille]] (1 hr). Thalys to Brussels (1 hr 20 min) use almost identical trains. Reservations are obligatory.\\n* '''ICE''': German [[high-speed train]]s, operating most services between Paris and [[Frankfurt]].\\n* '''Thalys''': A high-speed train service running daily to/from the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]. Though it can be a bit expensive compared to normal trains, tickets can be cheap enough if you buy in advance. On-board service is usually very good.\\n* '''Eurostar''': The Eurostar service connects Paris with [[London]] St. Pancras directly and [[Brussels]] indirectly, as well as many other destinations indirectly through the various west European rail services. Travel time between Paris Gare du Nord and [[London]] St Pancras International averages 2hr 15 min. Eurail and InterRail passes are ''not'' valid for this train, though pass holders can benefit from a reduced price. You must arrive at the station at least 90 minutes, and up to two hours, before the departure of the train to complete security and passport controls.\\n* '''[http://www.ouigo.com/ Ouigo]''': A subsidiary of SNCF running TGVs with a second class only layout intended and marketed as a lower-cost service. Strict baggage limits and 30-minute check in times make them more like budget airlines.\\n* '''Trenitalia''': Operates high-speed '''Frecciarossa''' trains between Paris, Lyon, Chamb\\u00e9ry, Modane, Turin, and Milan.

Not surprisingly, traffic jams are significantly worse during French school holidays.\\n\\nThe multi-lane highway around Paris, called the ''P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'' (BP), is probably preferable to driving through the center. Another beltway nearing completion; ''L'A86'' (also {{European road|FR|A|186}} and A286) loops around Paris about 10&nbsp;km further out from the ''P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique''. A third, incomplete beltway is much further out and called ''La Francilienne'' (N104).\\n\\nIt is advised not to drive within Paris and to be wary in the metropolitan area. It is better to drive to a suburban train station with a parking lot and then use the train to continue your trip throughout Paris. Most of Paris' roads were created long before the invention of automobiles. Traffic inside the city tends to be heavy, especially at rush hour; driving, however, may be rather easy and efficient in the evening. Parking is also difficult. Furthermore, the medieval nature of parts of the city's street system makes it very confusing, and traffic will almost never allow one to stop or slow down to get one's bearings. If you are unfamiliar with the streets and still insist on driving in the city, make sure you have a navigator in the passenger seat with you. However, Paris does have several iconic boulevards that have multiple lanes, form the backbone of the city\\u2019s road network, and are useful if you do choose to bring a car \\u2014 and are tourist attractions onto themselves.\\n\\nIn Paris, there are many car rental agencies offering a large number and wide range of vehicles for rental. Additionally, there are numerous car rental agencies located off-site which provide free airport transfers from their location and may offer lower prices well.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\n=== By public transport ===\\n[[File:Navigo Easy.jpg|thumb|\\n\\nNavigo Easy Travel Card\\n\\n]]Paris has an excellent public transport system that spans every inch of the city. It is well-known for its ''M\\u00e9tro'' (short for ''Chemin de fer m\\u00e9tropolitain'', \\\"Metropolitan Railway\\\"), ''RER'' (short for ''R\\u00e9seau Express R\\u00e9gional'', \\\"Regional Express Network,\\\"), and ''Transilien'' rail networks. The M\\u00e9tro, RER and  Transilien are complemented by a large network of trams and buses.\\n\\n[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en \\u00cele-de-France Mobilit\\u00e9s] is the authority that controls and coordinates the different transport companies operating in the \\u00cele-de-France region, including Paris. The website and app can be used to plan journeys, track services, and purchase tickets.\\n\\n[https://www.ratp.fr/en RATP] operates the M\\u00e9tro, trams, buses, and about half of the RER A and B. [https://www.transilien.com/en SNCF] operates the rest of the RER, as well as the Transilien. Both companies take the same tickets, so the difference is of little interest for most people except in case of strikes. For example, RATP may strike without SNCF doing so or the other way around.\\n\\nThe M\\u00e9tro and RER move staggering numbers of people into, out of, and around Paris (6.75 million people per day on average), and most of the time in reasonable comfort. However, certain lines are operating at or near capacity, sometimes being so full that you'll have to let one or two trains pass before being able to board. If you can help it, avoid M\\u00e9tro lines 1, 4, and 13 and RER line A and B during rush hours as these are the most congested lines in the system.\\n\\nStrikes, breakdown and construction are regular occurrences on the Paris public transit system. Generally during a strike, the M\\u00e9tro operates with reduced service and some RER lines may stop operating altogether. Visit the [https://www.ratp.fr/en RATP] or [https://www.transilien.com/en SNCF] websites for information on which routes are affected. Beware that real-time traffic information and construction announcements are often available only on the French-language version.\\n\\n==== By M\\u00e9tro ====\\n[[File:Carte M\\u00e9tro de Paris.svg|thumb|250x250px|M\\u00e9tro Map]]\\nLook for the M\\u00e9tro stations, marked with a large \\\"M\\\" sign or with an old-styled sign saying \\\"M\\u00e9tropolitain\\\".\\n\\nThere are 16 M\\u00e9tro lines (''lignes'') (''1''-''14'', ''3bis'', and ''7bis'') on which trains travel all day at intervals of a few minutes. Trains usually come 2\\u20133 minutes apart during rush hour and 5\\u201310 minutes apart during other times, depending on the line. The service starts on each end of every line at 05:30, and the last metro arrives on each end at 01:15 (service ends an hour later on Friday and Saturday nights, and the day before a holiday), stopping at all stations on the line. Some lines have rare trains that terminate at an intermediate station; if that happens, get off the train with the rest of the crowd and board the next train on the same track or on the other side of the platform (the driver will usually make an announcement in French). Lines 7 and 13 have a fork, so if you take line 13 north of ''La Fourche'' or line 7 south of ''Maison Blanche'', make sure to board the train for the correct destination which is indicated by a lit arrow on the sign in the middle of the platform and on colour-coded binders in each carriage. Times for trains can be seen on an electronic scroll board above the platform. Scheduled times for first and last trains are posted in each station on the centre sign. Generally, except for early and late hours, travellers should not worry about specific Metro train times; just get to your station and take the next train.\\n\\nThe lines are named according to the names of their terminal stations (the end of the line). If you ask the locals about directions, they will answer something like: take line number ''n'' towards \\\"end station _\\\", change at \\\"station _\\\", take the line ''nn'' towards \\\"end station _\\\" etc. The lines are also colour-coded.\\n\\nChanging metro lines might be difficult at times for visitors travelling to or from the airport or train stations with heavy luggage or those with impaired mobility, especially at major metro intersections. Moving from one platform to another generally involves walking up and down multiple flights of stairs. Very few stations have elevators (only the newest line 14 is wheelchair-accessible at all stations). Only the busiest ones have escalators. It might be a good idea to check out the bus routes and timings and see if one can find a convenient bus connection.\\n\\nEach station displays a detailed map of the surrounding area with a street list and the location of buildings (monuments, schools, places of worship, etc.,) as well as exits for that particular metro. Maps are located on the platform if the station has several exits or near the exit if there is only one exit.\\n\\nExcept for M\\u00e9tro 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, and 14, the doors will not open automatically. In such a case, there are handles or buttons located both inside and outside the train that you have to push or unlatch in order to open the door. Many locals may try to squeeze into the trains after the alarm has sounded to signal the closing of the doors. While one can occasionally pass through on lines with a driver, the automatic doors on M\\u00e9tro 1 and 14 will continue to close despite the presence of a limb or article of clothing. It is strongly advised to wait for the second train than to chance being caught between the doors.\\n\\nSome larger stations have secondary entrances, where there is no ticket booth. These are labelled ''voyageurs munis de billets'' (passengers with tickets).\\n\\n==== By RER ====\\n[[File:RER A - Gare Noisiel.JPG|thumb|Information on service OKRE, last stop Torcy]]There are five commuter train lines that cross Paris: RER A, B, C, D, and E. RER trains run at intervals varying from about 3 minutes (RER A) to 6 minutes (RER D), and stop at every station '''within''' Paris. Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend.\\n\\nRER trains will stop at every station within Paris (zone 1), but may skip stations outside Paris, so if you're going to the suburbs make sure your RER stops where you need! Information about the stops to be made by the next incoming train is presented on a separate board also hanging from the ceiling.\\n\\nRER trains do not have publicly announced numbers unlike the rest of SNCF network; the four letter codes (COHI, ELAO, QYAN, VICK, etc.) take the role of the train numbers instead; the first letter indicates the station where the train terminates, and the other three indicate the route and stops. Each line has its own nomenclature. You can look up what these codes mean on information panels in the station, but the easiest and fastest way is often to check the information screens along the platforms.\\n\\n==== By Transilien ====\\nThe rest of the regional train network, called \\\"Transilien\\\", departs from the main train stations (Lyon for line R, Est for line P, Nord for lines H and K, St-Lazare for lines J and L, Montparnasse for line N) and La D\\u00e9fense (line U). Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend. The Transilien is marginally less crowded than the RER and the Metro.\\n\\n==== By tram ====\\nMost tourists will not encounter the trams as they run only on the outskirts of the city. Trams T3a & T3b go nearly three quarters of the way round the city at the edge. Tram line 7 connects Orly Airport with RER line C; it is cheap but not fast.\\n\\n==== By bus ====\\nA bus ride is interesting if you want to see more of the city. All stops have a name and are clearly marked on the street. At complex intersections, stops usually have a map that lets you know where other lines stop and if applicable where to find a M\\u00e9tro entrance. If more than one line stops, wave to the driver to let them know you want to board. All buses have a schematic map of the line on display with all stop names, bus connections and major street names. Electronic displays inside each bus tell riders its current position and what stops remain, but don't overly rely on them as they don't always work.\\n\\nSince the M\\u00e9tro is primarily structured around a hub-and-spoke model, there are some journeys for which it can be quite inefficient. In these cases it is worth seeing if a direct bus route exists, despite the complexity of the bus network.\\n\\n''Noctilien'' night buses run regularly through the central hub at Chatelet to outlying areas of greater Paris. There is also a circle line connecting the main train stations. It pays to know one's Noctilien route ahead of time in case one misses the last M\\u00e9tro home. Women travellers should probably avoid taking the Noctilien on their own to destinations outside Paris.\\n\\n==== Fares ====\\n\\nA Navigo Travel Card is required to use public transport in Paris city and the wider \\u00cele-de-France region. The card can be loaded with a variety of fares (e.g. 10 M\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Tickets). It cannot be loaded with credit like other cards around the world (e.g. \\u20ac50). The card needs to be validated at the start of a journey and when transferring to a new tram or bus. It does not need to be validated at the end of a journey unless required to exit a fare gate.\\n\\nThe following cards are available to obtain:\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\"\\n|+Navigo Travel Cards\\n!Navigo in English\\n!Navigo in French\\n!Price\\n!Locations to obtain/load\\n!Fares available to load\\n|-\\n|[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/smartphone '''Navigo on Smartphone''']\\n|''Navigo sur Smartphone''\\n|Free\\n|\\n\\u00cele-de-France Mobilit\\u00e9s app,<br>\\nBonjour RATP app,<br>\\nSNCF Connect app,<br>\\nApple Wallet app,<br>\\nSamsung Wallet app\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Ticket,<br>\\nBus-Tram Ticket,<br>\\nAirports Ticket,<br>\\nRoissyBus Ticket,<br>\\nDay Ticket,<br>\\nWeek Ticket,<br>\\nMonth Ticket,<br>\\nParis Visite Ticket\\n|-\\n|[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/navigo-easy-travel-card '''Navigo Easy Travel Card''']\\n|''Passe Navigo Easy''\\n|\\u20ac2\\n|\\nTicket Windows,<br>\\nTicket Machines\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Ticket,<br>\\nBus-Tram Ticket,<br>\\nAirports Ticket,<br>\\nRoissyBus Ticket,<br>\\nDay Ticket,<br>\\nParis Visite Ticket\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/navigo-decouverte-travel-card Navigo D\\u00e9couverte Travel Card]'''\\n|''Passe Navigo D\\u00e9couverte''\\n|\\u20ac5\\n|\\nTicket Windows,<br>\\nTicket Machines\\n|\\nDay Ticket,<br>\\nWeek Ticket,<br>\\nMonth Ticket\\n|}\\nThe following fares are available to load:\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\"\\n|+Fares in Paris and \\u00cele-de-France\\n!Fare in English\\n!Fare in French\\n!Price\\n!Validity\\n!Rules\\n|-\\n|[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/metro-train-rer-ticket '''M\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Ticket''']\\n|''Billet M\\u00e9tro-Train-RER''\\n|\\u20ac2.50\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular\\n|\\nValid for 120 minutes,<br>\\nNot valid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nIncludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/bus-tram-ticket Bus-Tram Ticket]'''\\n|''Billet Bus-Tram''\\n|\\u20ac2\\n|\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable\\n|\\nValid for 90 minutes,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nIncludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/paris-region-airports-ticket Airports Ticket]'''\\n|''Billet A\\u00e9roports''\\n|\\u20ac13\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nOrlyval\\n|\\nValid for 120 minutes,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nIncludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/orlybus-and-roissybus-tickets RoissyBus Ticket]'''\\n|''Billet RoissyBus''\\n|\\u20ac13\\n|\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid for 90 minutes,<br>\\nValid to/from Charles de Gaulle airport,<br>\\nExcludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-day-ticket Day Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Jour''\\n|\\u20ac12\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable\\n|\\nValid any day,<br>\\nNot valid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable up to 6 days in advance\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-weekly-ticket Week Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Semaine''\\n|\\u20ac31.60\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable,<br>\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid from Monday to Sunday,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable from Friday to Thursday\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-monthly-ticket Month Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Mois''\\n|\\u20ac88.80\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable,<br>\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid from 1st to 31st,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable from 20th to 19th\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/paris-visite-ticket Paris Visite Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Paris Visite''\\n|\\u20ac29.90\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable,<br>\\nOrlyval,<br>\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid any day,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable in advance\\n|}\\nPaper tickets were completely discontinued in 2025.\\n\\nTicket inspectors roam the network and show no mercy to tourists pleading ignorance. Travelling without a ticket will result in you being cited and forced to pay a fine on the spot. Inspections usually take place behind the turnstiles at major metro stations or during transfers.\\n===By boat===\\n[[File:Bateaux Mouches Paris 2011.jpg|thumb|A bateau mouche near the Pont Neuf]]\\nThere are several excellent boat services which make use of the Seine. As well as providing easy, cheap transport to much of central Paris, excellent photo opportunities abound. You can buy a day or 3 day ticket and hop on and off the boat as needed. The boats take a circular route from the Eiffel Tower, down past the Louvre, Notre Dame, botanical gardens then back up the other bank past Mus\\u00e9e d'Orsay.  [http://www.batobus.com/ Batobus] offers a regular shuttle service between the main tourist sights (closed Jan); other companies such as the famous [http://www.bateaux-mouches.fr Bateaux Mouches] offer sightseeing cruises.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\n\\n{{Infobox|To stop a taxi|If the sign is green, the cab is available, if it is red, the cab is busy, if it is off, the cab is off}}\\n\\nTaxis are comparatively cheap especially at night when there are no traffic jams to be expected. There are not as many as one would expect, and sometimes finding a taxi can be challenging. In the daytime, it is not always a good idea to take a taxi, as walking or taking the metro (''See: M\\u00e9tro'') will often be faster. If you know you will need one to get to the airport, or to a meeting, it is wise to book ahead by phone.\\n\\nThe initial fare is \\u20ac2.40 and the meter increases by around \\u20ac1.10 each kilometer and around 50 cents each minute spent at red lights or in traffic jams. Fares are fixed by the city law and every driver complies with them. Fares vary according to the day of the week, the hour of the day and the area you're crossing. If you call a taxi, the meter starts when you call and not when you get in. You should expect a \\u20ac5 to \\u20ac10 fare on the meter when the taxi arrives after you call it.\\n\\n'''Remember''' if a taxi is near a 'taxi station', they're not supposed to pick you up ''except'' at the station where there may be people waiting for a taxi. Taxi stations are usually near train stations, big hotels, hospitals, and large crossings.\\n\\nThere are a number of services by which you can call for taxis or make a reservation in advance. The two largest fleet are Taxis G7 and Taxis Bleus:\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis G7 | url=http://www.taxisg7.fr | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 47 39 47 39 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis Bleus | url=http://www.taxis-bleus.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 891 70 10 10 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\nAs in many other cities a taxi can be difficult to stop; you may have to try several times. When you do get a taxi to stop, the driver will usually roll down his window to ask you where you want to go. If the driver can't (or doesn't want to) go where you want, he might tell you that he's near the end of his work day & can't possibly get you where you want before he has to go off-duty.\\n\\nThere is a \\u20ac6.40 minimum (2012) on all taxi rides, mandated by city law, but the meter does not show this amount, which can result in being asked to pay more than the metered amount on short rides. In Paris taxis are required by law to charge for the trip with a meter, charging a flat rate is illegal, except from/to Charles de Gaulle airport (\\u20ac50 from the right bank of the Seine, \\u20ac55 from the left bank) and Orly airport (\\u20ac35 from the right bank, \\u20ac30 from the left bank). Frequently the taxi driver will not want to drive you all the way to the doorstep, but will prefer to let you out a block or so away if there are one or more one-way streets to contend with. Try to look at this as a cost-savings rather than an inconvenience. You should pay while still seated in the cab as in New York and ''not'' through the front window London style. A tip is included in the fare price; If you're especially satisfied with the service, you can give something (basically 10%), but you don't ''have'' to. There is an extra charge for baggage handling.\\n\\nThe driver will not let you sit in the front seat (unless there are 3 or 4 of you, which is a rare case usually expedited by more money). Taxi-drivers come in all types, some nice, some rude, some wanting to chat, some not. Smoking in taxis is generally not allowed, however it might be that the taxi driver himself wants a cigarette in which case the rule might become flexible. Many drivers prefer that you avoid using your cellphone during the ride; if you ''do have'' to, make an apologizing gesture & sound, and do make a '''short''' call.\\n\\nIf for any reason you wish to file a complaint about a Paris taxi, take note of the taxi's number on the sticker on the left hand backseat window. Beware of illegal taxis (see the 'Stay Safe' section).\\n\\n===By car===\\n\\nIn a word: '''don't'''. It is generally a very bad idea to rent a car to visit Paris. Traffic is very dense during the day, and parking is, on average, exceedingly difficult and expensive. This is especially true in areas surrounding points of interest, since many of these are in areas designed long before automobiles existed. A majority of Parisian households do not own cars, and many people who move to the city find themselves selling their cars within a month or two.\\n\\nThat said, driving may be an option for going to some sights in the suburbs such as Vaux-le-Vicomte castle or the castle and city at [[Fontainebleau]], or for starting to other places in France. You may prefer to rent from a location outside Paris proper.\\n\\nTraffic rules in Paris are basically the same as elsewhere in France, with the exception of having to yield to incoming traffic on roundabouts. However, driving in dense traffic in Paris and suburbs during commute times, can be especially strenuous. Be prepared for traffic jams, cars changing lanes at short notice, and so on. Another issue is pedestrians, who tend to fearlessly jaywalk more in Paris than in other French cities. Be prepared for pedestrians crossing the street on red, and expect similar adventurous behaviour from cyclists. Remember that even if a pedestrian or cyclist crossed on red, if you hit him, you (in fact, your insurance) will have to bear civil responsibility for the damages, and possibly prosecution for failing to control your vehicle. Note that the speed limit in Paris is 30 km/h in almost every street, besides a few large avenues clearly marked as such. There are no stop signs in the city center.\\n\\nParis has several orbital roads. There is a series of boulevards named after Napoleonic-era generals (''Boulevard Mass\\u00e9na'', ''Boulevard Ney'', and so forth), and collectively referred to as ''boulevards des Mar\\u00e9chaux''. These are normal wide avenues, with traffic lights. Somewhat outside of these is the ''boulevard p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'', a controlled-access road with grade separation. The ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique int\\u00e9rieur'' is the inner lanes (going clockwise), the ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique ext\\u00e9rieur'' the outer lanes (going anti-clockwise). Despite the looks, the ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'' is not an ''autoroute'': the speed limit is 70 km/h and, very unusually, incoming traffic has the right of way, at least theoretically (presumably because, otherwise, nobody would be able to enter during rush hour).\\n\\n=== By chauffeur ===\\nKnown as car services or livery cabs, these cars are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares. You need to book them before they can pick you up. They are flat rate rather than metered (''ask for the fare before getting in''), and there are two types of licence: the \\\"Grande Remise\\\" that allows the car & driver to pick-up & drop-off passengers anywhere in France, and the \\\"carte verte\\\" that allows pick-up & drop-off in the department or region where the company is based. The Grande Remise cars have a GR on their front plate. They provide more service than a normal cab.\\n* Shared shuttle: You have to share the shuttle with other customers. They can be delayed since the shuttle needs to pick up other customers and perhaps drop them off before you, but they are cheaper than a private shuttle.\\n* Private shuttle: Will pick you up on-time and drop you off directly to the address specified in the booking.\\n\\n=== By motorcycle ===\\nParis is an incredibly open city, with its many \\\"Grands Boulevards\\\" and monuments with large open spaces around make it a city perfect to be explored and viewed by scooter or motorbike. Be warned that scooter/motorbike is by far the mode of transportation with the most casualties in Paris: half of victims of a collision were riding one, although they only account for about 2% of the traffic. When you're riding a scooter or motorbike in Paris, even if you see others doing so, it is not allowed to \\\"lane-split\\\" between the rows of cars waiting in traffic. At the red lights, even though a lot of scooter and motorbike drivers do not respect it, don't forget to pay attention to the bike designated area: you are not allowed to use them, and doing so is equivalent to failing to respect the red light (\\u20ac135 fine). Parking-wise there are plenty of ''deux roues'' (two wheel) parking spots all over the city. Again, even though you may see plenty of scooters or motorbikes parked on the sidewalk, it is forbidden to do so.

Most speak English well. A simple \\\"''Bonjour Monsieur / Madame, parlez-vous anglais?''\\\" should suffice.}}\\n\\nRenting a bike is a very good alternative over driving or using public transport and an excellent way to see the sights. Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than almost any town or city in the United States. The French are very cognizant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. Paris hasn't always been the easiest place to get around by bike, but that is no longer the case. The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well, in establishing some separated bike lanes, creating a bikesharing system, and allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riverside paths which are perfect for cycling. The Paris bike network now counts over 150&nbsp;km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist. In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-hours of the day when traffic is lighter. Do remember to bring a good map, since there is no grid plan to speak of and almost all of the smaller streets are one-way.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Paris Walking 101|To get a great orientation of the city on foot while seeing many of Paris' major sights, you can do a West to East walk along the [[Axe Historique]] from the Arc de Triomphe to \\u00cele de la Cit\\u00e9 (Notre Dame). This walk takes about 1-2 hours without any stops. Start at the top of the Champs Elys\\u00e9es (at the Arc de Triomphe) and begin walking down the Champs Elys\\u00e9es towards Place ('square') de la Concorde.\\n*On the way towards the obelisk on the square, you'll see the major stores and restaurants of Paris' most famous avenue.\\n*Once you've passed the main shopping area, you'll see the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais to your right.\\n*At Place de la Concorde, you'll be able to see many of Paris' major monuments around you. In front of you is the Tuileries, behind you is the Champs-Elysees and Arc de Triomphe, behind you to your right is the Tour Eiffel and Musee d'Orsay, and finally, to your left is the Madeleine.\\n*Continue straight ahead and enter the Tuileries Gardens passing by fountains, flowers, and lovers in the park.\\n*As you continue straight ahead, and out of the garden, you'll see the pyramid entrance to the Louvre directly in front of you.\\n*With the pyramid directly in front of you, and the Tuileries directly behind you, turn to your right and walk towards the Seine.\\n*Now you can walk along the Seine (eastwards) until you reach Pont Neuf. Cross Pont Neuf and walk through the Latin Quarter, cross the river again to reach Notre Dame cathedral on Ile de la Cit\\u00e9.}}\\n\\nWhile the streets of Paris are generally fairly easy on novice cyclists, there are some streets in the city that should be avoided by those who do not have sufficient urban cycling experience. Rue de Rivoli, Place de la Bastille, and Place de la Nation are particularly hairy, especially during weekdays and the Saturday evening rush, and should not be navigated by anyone not confident in their ability to cycle in heavy traffic. Avenue des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, Place de l'\\u00c9toile, and voie Georges Pompidou (the lower-level express lanes along the banks of the Seine) should be avoided at all times.\\n\\nParis has a bike share system known as{{listing\\n| name=V\\u00e9lib' | alt= | url=https://www.velib-metropole.fr/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 76 49 12 34 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\u20ac5 per day, first half hour free\\n|wikidata=|image=| lastedit=2019-02-10\\n| content=In January 2018, the original V\\u00e9lib' was replaced by a new system called V\\u00e9lib' M\\u00e9tropole, that encompasses an ever larger area than the previous one. At first there were some technical issues, but by the end of 2018 it seems like they were mostly resolved. Bikes include a screen showing eg. how long a bike has been rented. Some electric bikes are also available (for an extra fee).\\n}} You can purchase the V\\u00e9lib pass online. An app helps finding stations and available parking slots. Green V\\u00e9lib bikes are normal bikes, blue V\\u00e9libs are ebikes.\\n\\n===By foot===\\n\\nWalking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous caf\\u00e9s and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the ''Metro'' may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.\\n\\nThe smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you'll be able to see more of the city. That said, pay attention to the M\\u00e9tro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the M\\u00e9tro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by walking along a major boulevard until you find a M\\u00e9tro station.\\n\\nYou may have heard of the hazard of walking into dog droppings in Paris. The problem is now virtually nonexistent due to fines as high as \\u20ac180 and extensive street cleaning operations.\\n\\nIt's always fun to experience the city by foot, and there are numerous walking tours around Paris, whether self-guided (with the help of a guidebook or online guide) or with a touring guide (booked through your travel agency or hotel). The city is best explored by foot, and some of the most marvelous memories you will have of Paris is walking through secret found places.\\n\\nPedestrian call buttons at crosswalks are activated by pressing the button underneath the call button box.\\n\\n==Talk==\\n\\n[[French]] (''fran\\u00e7ais'') is of course the country's official language. Any native French person will speak French and it helps if you can speak a bit of it. In the parts of the city that tourists frequent the most, the shopkeepers, information booth attendants, and other workers are likely to answer you in English, even if your French is advanced. These workers tend to deal with thousands of foreign-speaking tourists, and responding in English is often faster than repeating themselves in French. This is not the case for the rest of the city.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Reading up|Before you leave you may want to read a book like ''French or Foe'' by Polly Platt or ''Almost French'' by Sarah Turnbull \\u2014 interesting, well-written records from English-speaking people who live in France.}}\\n\\nFor most Parisians, English is something they had to study in school, and thus seems a bit of a chore. People helping you out in English are making an extra effort, sometimes a considerable one. Parisians younger than 40 are much more likely to be fluent in English. Immigrants, often working in service jobs, are less likely to speak English. If it's your first time in France you will have some problems understanding what people are saying, even with prior education in French. Unlike most language education tapes, real Parisians tend to speak fast, use slang, and swallow some letters.\\n\\nWhen attempting to speak French, do not be offended if people ask you to repeat, or seem not to understand you, as they are not acting out of snobbery. Keep your sense of humour, and if necessary, write down phrases or place names. And remember to speak slowly and clearly. Unless you have an advanced level and can at least sort of understand French movies, you should also assume that it will be difficult for people to understand what you are saying (imagine someone speaking English to you in an indiscernible accent).\\n\\nWhen in need of directions what you should do is this: find a younger person, or a person reading some book or magazine in English, who is obviously not in a hurry; say \\\"hello\\\" or \\\"''bonjour''\\\" (bon-zhor); start by asking if the person speaks English, \\\"Parlez-vous anglais?\\\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay?) even if the person can read something in English, speak slowly and clearly; write down place names if necessary. Smile a lot. Also, carry a map (preferably ''Paris par Arrondissement''); given the complexity of Paris streets it is difficult to explain how to find any particular address in any language, no matter how well you speak it. If anything, the person may have an idea as to the place you are looking for, but may not know exactly where it may be, so the map always helps.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you will probably get the cold shoulder if you stop a random person in the m\\u00e9tro, fail to greet them and say \\\"where is place X or street Y\\\".\\n\\nNow, if you speak French, remember two '''magic phrases''': \\\"Excusez-moi de vous d\\u00e9ranger\\\" [ex-kuh-zay mwuh duh voo day-rawn-ZHAY] (\\\"Sorry to bother you\\\") and \\\"Pourriez-vous m'aider?\\\" [por-EE-AY voo may-DAY] (\\\"Could you help me?\\\") especially in shops; politeness will work wonders.\\n\\nIt is considered polite to always say \\\"bonjour\\\" (during the day) or \\\"bonsoir\\\" (at night) to employees when entering any type of shop even if you have no intention of buying anything. Upon leaving you should say \\\"merci\\\" to thank the shopkeeper for allowing you to browse and say \\\"bonne journ\\u00e9e\\\" (bun zhur-nay) or \\\"bonne soir\\u00e9e\\\" (bun swa-ray) to wish them a good day or evening. \\\"Bonne nuit\\\" is only used when telling someone \\\"goodnight\\\" when going to bed.\\n\\nFinally, if you speak a language other than English or French, and your French is limited or non-existent, offer to speak your second language with the phrase \\\"Parlez-vous anglais ou XXXX?\\\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay oo XXXX?) as this shows that you are making an effort to speak somebody else's language as well as your own.\\n\\n[[File:Pont des Arts, Paris.jpg|thumb|750px|center|The Pont des Arts (Bridge of the Arts) and just behind, the pont Neuf (\\\"New Bridge\\\", but actually the oldest in Paris) and the \\u00eele de la Cit\\u00e9.]]\\n\\n==See==\\n{{Mapframe|48.86473|2.33362|width=600|zoom=12||show=mask,see,do}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q50716}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q216125}}\\n\\nThe listings below are just some '''highlights''' of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Paris.

These include: The Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle, and the catacombs<!-- and the steps to climb to the top of the Notre Dame Cathedral-->. To avoid lines, you should start your day by arriving at one of these sites at least 30 minutes before opening time. Otherwise, expect a wait of at least an hour. Most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday. Examples: the Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while the Orsay Museum is closed on Mondays. Be sure to check museum closing dates to avoid disappointment! Also, most ticket counters close 30-45 min before final closing.\\n\\nAll national museums are open free of charge on the first Sunday of the month. However, this may mean long lines and crowded exhibits. Keep away from Paris during Easter week due to crowding. People have to queue up at the Eiffel Tower for several hours even early in the morning. However, this wait can be greatly reduced, if fit, by walking the first two levels, then buying an elevator ticket to the top. Entry to the permanent exhibitions at city-run museums is free at all times (admission is charged for temporary exhibitions).\\n\\n===Sightseeing passes===\\nOne of the best value and most convenient ways to see the sights of Paris is with the [http://www.parismuseumpass.com/en/home.php ''Paris Museum Pass'']{{Dead link|date=March 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}, a pre-paid entry card that allows entry into over 70 museums and monuments around Paris (and the Palace of Versailles) and comes in 2-day (\\u20ac62), 4-day (\\u20ac77) and 6-day (\\u20ac92) denominations (August 2024). These are ''consecutive'' days. The card allows you to jump lengthy queues, a big plus during tourist season when lines can be extensive, and is available from participating museums, tourist offices, FNAC branches and all the main M\\u00e9tro and RER train stations. You will still need to pay to enter most special exhibitions. To avoid waiting in the first long queue to purchase the museum pass, stop to purchase your pass a day or more in advance after mid-day. The pass does not become active until your first museum or site visit when you write your start date. After that, the days covered are consecutive. Do not write your start date until you are certain you will use the pass that day and be careful to use the European date style as indicated on the card: day-month-year.\\n\\nAlso consider the [http://www.parispass.com/ ''ParisPass''], a pre-paid entry card + queue jumping to 60 attractions including the Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, as well as a river cruise which allows free metro & public transport travel.\\n\\n==Do==\\n===Sports===\\n* {{do\\n| name=[[Paris/16th arrondissement#Q43605|French Open]] | alt=Roland Garros | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=48.84716 | long=2.24924 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| image=Roland Garros Stadium in 2007.jpg\\n| content=One of the 4 Tennis Grand Slam tournaments.

The French capital offers a spectacular array of photographic expositions and opportunities to the beginner and the pro alike. It has photogenic monuments (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, the obelisk at Concorde, and countless others); architecture (e.g., the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Museum of the Arab World) and urban street scenes (e.g., in the Marais, Montmartre and Belleville). When you tire of taking your own photos, visit one of the many institutions dedicated to photography. At these and other institutions, you can learn the about the rich history of Paris as the place of important developments in photography (e.g., the Daguerrotype) and as the home of many of the trade's great artists (e.g., Robert Doisneau, Andr\\u00e9 Kert\\u00e9sz, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson).\\n\\n* {{listing | type=do\\n| name=Maison Europ\\u00e9ene de la Photographie | alt=La MEP | url=https://www.mep-fr.org/english/ | email=\\n| address=5/7 Rue de Fourcy | lat=48.8551395| long=2.3567364| directions=Metro Saint-Paul, Pont Marie\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=W-Su 11:00-20:00 | price=Admission \\u20ac9\\n| wikipedia=/Maison_europ\\u00e9enne_de_la_photographie\\n| lastedit=2019-09-29\\n| content=Important center for contemporary photography with a large exposition area having three or four major expositions per year dedicated to contemporary photography.

Unless you possess one of a number of in-demand skills, it will almost certainly be necessary to obtain a job offer from an employer before arriving. Your employer, for their part, will have to have the offer approved by the relevant governmental authorities, as well. If you opt for unreported work, such as babysitting, you need not fret about going through the process to obtain a ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'', i.e., a formal visitor's identity card. However, if you do choose a change in location, it is advisable to obtain a ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'' prior to finding any job whatsoever, as the process can be longer than expected. A ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'' is often necessary to open a bank account and the like, and by extension for accomplishing any number of other tasks involved in modern life, so unless you're very comfortable transacting everything in cash you should probably bite the bullet and keep things on the up-and-up.\\n\\nIf you go to Paris for a conference, there's a very good chance you'll end up in a meeting or exhibiting at CNIT (Centre of New Industries and Technology).

The city holds a great abundance of work ready to be found, even if the search feels nerve-wracking at first.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n\\nParis is one of the great '''fashion''' centres of the Western world, up there with [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], and [[Milan]], making it a shopper's delight. While the Paris fashion scene is constantly evolving, the major shopping centres tend to be the same. High end couture can be found in the 8th arrondissement. In summer, there is nothing better than browsing the boutiques along Canal St-Martin, or strolling along the impressive arcades of the historic Palais-Royal, with beautifully wrapped purchases swinging on each arm.\\n\\n'''Le Marais''' is a mostly Jewish neighbourhood, most of the shops in Le Marais are open on Sundays. The stores in this area are intimate, boutique, \\\"Parisian\\\" style clothing stores. You will no doubt find something along each street, and it is always well worth the look.\\n\\nOther great areas to shop around in are around the area '''S\\u00e8vres Babylone''' (M\\u00e9tro Line 10 and Line 12). It is in this area you will find the Le Bon March\\u00e9 [[Paris/7th arrondissement|7th]], particularly ''rue de Cherche Midi'' [[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]. The area boasts some of the major fashion houses (Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, etc.) and also has smaller private boutiques with handmade clothing.\\n\\nIn the '''Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pr\\u00e9s''', you can find a handful of vintage clothing shops, carrying anything from couture early 20th century dresses, to 70s Chanel sunglasses. Walking along ''Boulevard Saint-Germain'', you will find major brands. However, if in search of eclectic finds, opt to walk the northern side of the Boulevard, especially along '''rue Saint Andr\\u00e9 des Arts''', where you can always find a nice caf\\u00e9 to stop in. The area south of Saint-Germain is just as nice, and comes with a price tag to match.\\n\\nIn the artsy quarters of 1 and 4, there are many bargains to be had, once again, if you are prepared to look. Souvenirs are easily found and can be fairly inexpensive as long as you don't buy from the tourist sites. For cheap books of French connection, try the University/Latin quarter as they sell books in all languages starting from half a euro each.\\n\\n===Flea markets===\\nParis has 3 main flea markets, all on the outskirts of the central city. The most famous of these is the '''March\\u00e9 aux Puces de St-Ouen (Porte de Clignancourt)''' (Clignancourt Flea Market), ''M\\u00e9tro: Porte de Clignancourt'', in the [[Paris/18th arrondissement#Buy|18th]], a haven for lovers of antiques, second-hand goods, and retro fashion. The best days to go are Saturday and Sunday. There are particular times of the week when only antique collectors are allowed into the stalls, and there are also times of the day when the stall owners take their ''Parisian siesta'', and enjoy a leisurely cappuccino for an hour or so. The best times to visit the flea markets are in the spring and summertime, when the area is more vibrant.

On Fridays, most open until late. Most even have the benefit of bottles of wine so you can wander in with your glass of wine and feel very ''artistique''. Great roads to walk along are ''rue de Seine'', ''rue Jacob'', ''rue des Beaux Arts'', ''Rue Bonaparte'', and ''Rue Mazarine''.\\nAlso, be sure to visit the historical district of ''Montparnasse'' and ''quartier Vavin'' where artists like Modigliani, Gauguin and Zadkine used to work.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n\\nParis is one of Europe's culinary centres, where the ''haute cuisine'' has flourished since at least the French revolution. It may however come as a surprise that Paris isn't considered the culinary capital of [[French cuisine]]; many people prefer the French cooking found in small rural restaurants, outside of the city, closer to the farms and with their focus on freshness and regional specialities. Even among French cities, Paris has long been considered by the French as second to [[Lyon]] for fine dining.\\n\\nThere have been other challenges in the last 20 years or so as restaurateurs in places like [[San Francisco]] and [[Sydney]] briefly surpassed their Parisian fore bearers, again with an emphasis on freshness of ingredients but also borrowings from other cuisines. Parisian cooks didn't just rest on their laurels during this time, rather they travelled, taught, and studied, and together with Paris's own immigrant communities, have revitalized the restaurant trade. Today you can find hundreds of beautiful restaurants with thoughtful (or just trendy) interior design and well-planned and executed ''cartes'' and ''menus'' offering a creative ''m\\u00e9lange'' of French and exotic foreign cuisines. It's safe to say that Paris is once again catching up with or edging ahead of its ''Anglophone'' rivals.\\n\\nOf course there are also some traditional offerings, and for the budget conscious there are hundreds of traditional bistros, with their sidewalk ''terraces'' offering a choice of fairly simple (usually meat centred) meals for reasonable prices.\\n\\nIt is unfortunately possible to have a uniformly poor dining experience during a stay in Paris, probably because mass tourism attracts price gougers. It is frequent to hear people complaining of very high Parisian prices for very poor food and service. Since so many of the restaurants are sub-par, the best approach is to rely on a restaurant guide and personal recommendations. Do your research in advance if possible and be prepared to travel some distance. Don't just walk down the street expecting to find good food; you probably won't.\\n\\nMany restaurants are tiny and have tables close together - square metres are at a premium and understandably restaurateurs need to make the most of limited space. In some cases when the restaurant is crowded, you may have to sit beside strangers at the same table. If that does not appeal to you, go to a more upscale place where you will pay for the extra space.\\n\\nTrendy restaurants often require reservations weeks, if not months in advance. If you haven't planned far enough ahead, try to get a reservation for lunch which is generally easier and less expensive.\\n\\nFor an easy-to-manage eating budget while in Paris, consider: breakfast or \\\"petit d\\u00e9jeuner\\\" at a restaurant, possibly in your hotel, consisting of some croissants, coffee, and maybe a piece of fruit. Get a 'walking lunch' from one of Paris' many food stands\\u2014a ''panino'' in the centre of the city, a crepe from a crepe stand, a felafel pita or take-out Chinese in the Marais. ''Traiteurs'' serving Chinese and/or Vietnamese food are ubiquitous in the city and good for a cheap lunch and many ''p\\u00e2tisseries'' sell inexpensive coffee and sandwiches. All these are cheap (about the same as breakfast), easy, and allow you to maximize your sightseeing and walking time while enjoying delicious local or ethnic food. For dinner, stroll the streets at dusk and consider a \\u20ac20-40 prix-fixe menu. This will get you 3 or 4 courses, possibly with wine, and an unhurried, candlelit, magical evening. If you alternate days like this with low-budget, self-guided eating (picnicking, snacking, street food) you will be satisfied without breaking the bank.\\n\\nIf one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch. Virtually all restaurants offer a good prix-fixe deal. By complementing this with a bakery breakfast and a light self-catered dinner, you will be able to experience the best of Parisian food and still stick to a budget.\\n\\n===Self-catering===\\nBudget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the [[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]] or in any other arrondissement). If your accommodation has cooking facilities you're set, especially for wine and cheese, a decent bottle of French wine will set you back all of about \\u20ac3-5, while the ''fairly good'' stuff starts at around \\u20ac7. Bottles for less than \\u20ac3 are not recommended.\\n\\nThe small ''\\u00e9piceries'' which open until late are more expensive than the ''supermarch\\u00e9s'' (Casino, Monoprix, Franprix, etc.) For wine, the price difference can be up to \\u20ac2.\\n\\nBuy a baguette, some cheese and a good bottle of wine and join the Parisian youth for a ''pique-nique'' along the Seine (especially on the \\u00cele Saint-Louis) or along the Canal Saint-Martin. The finest food stores are Lafayette Gourmet in the Galeries Lafayette or La Grande Epicerie in the luxury department store Le Bon March\\u00e9. They are worth discovering. You will find a large variety of wines there, otherwise try wine stores (cavistes) that are present everywhere in the city, and sell all kind of good French wine that you won't find in a supermarket. The owners usually know their wines and will be happy to help you choose among their huge selection. Some also sell good food. You can search for one online or ask a local. There are also some \\\"wine supermarkets\\\" such as Nicolas or Le Relais de Bacchus (all over the city) that sell more common wines.\\n\\n===Some specialities===\\n\\nFor '''seafood''' lovers, Paris is a great place to try ''moules frites'' (steamed mussels and French fries) (better in fall and winter), oysters, sea snails, and other delicacies. '''Meat''' specialties include venison (deer), boar, and other game (especially in the fall and winter hunting season), as well as French favourites such as lamb, veal, beef, and pork.\\n\\n===Prices===\\nEating out in Paris can be expensive. However don't believe people when they say you can't do Paris on the cheap - you can! The key is to stay away from the beaten tracks and the obviously expensive Champs Elys\\u00e9es. Around the lesser visited quarters especially, there are many cheap and yummy restaurants to be found. The area around Fontaine Saint-Michel, the fountain facing Notre Dame is crowded by particularly tasty places to eat, with good ambiance, cheap prices and excellent service, with the advantage of being very centric of many places of interest. The key is to order from the prix-fixe menu, and ''not'' off the A la Carte menu unless you want to pay an arm and a leg. In many places a three course meal can be found for about \\u20ac15. This way you can sample the food cheaply and is usually more \\\"French\\\". Ask for \\\"une carafe d'eau\\\" (oon karaaf doe) to get free tap water.\\n\\n===Kosher dining===\\nParis has the largest number of Kosher restaurants in any European city. Walk up and down Rue des Rosiers to see the variety and choices available from Israeli, Sushi, Italian and others. You will also find a wide assortment of Kosher restaurants in the 9th arrondissement of Paris near the rue Richer and rue Cadet areas. See the district guides for examples. Kosher restaurants and snacks usually display a big orange rectangle on their front, which ensure clients that they are Beth din certified.\\n\\n===Vegetarian dining===\\n<!-- please put individual restaurant listings in the appropriate arrondissement page -->\\n\\nFor '''vegetarians''', eating traditional French food will require some improvisation, as it is heavily meat-based. That being said, it is far easier to be vegetarian in Paris than it is elsewhere in France. Paris has several excellent vegetarian restaurants, and many non-vegetarian restaurants will provide vegetarian dishes. \\n\\nWhen eating in a traditional restaurant, be careful before ordering dishes labelled as \\\"vegetarian\\\". Many French people presume that ''fish'' and ''seafood'' are vegetarian dishes. This is a widely spread misunderstanding all around the country. Additionally, French people tend to confuse \\\"real\\\" vegetarians with vegans. When explaining that you're a vegetarian that won't eat fish, people will often presume that you don't eat milk or egg-based products.\\n\\nLook for spots such as Le Grenier de Notre-Dame in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]'''. The '''[[Paris/10th arrondissement|10th]]''' arrondissement also has quite a large variety of vegetarian restaurants, especially of Indian and East/South-East Asian fare. See the arrondissement pages for more listings. For fast food and snacks, you can always find a vegetarian sandwich or pizza, or indeed French tacos. Even a kebab shop can make you something with just cheese and salad, or perhaps falafel. And for healthier fare, it's not usually hard nowadays to find hipstery places that sell vegan poke bowls.\\n\\nThere are also lots of Italian, Thai, Indian, and Mezo-American places where you will have little problem. The famous South Indian chain Saravana Bhavan have their branch near Gare Du Nord. In Rue des Rosiers (4th arrondissement) you can get delicious falafel in the many Jewish restaurants. Another place to look for falafel is on Rue Oberkampf (11th arrondissement). Take away falafel usually goes for \\u20ac5 or less.\\n\\nMoroccan and Algerian cooking is common in Paris - vegetarian couscous is lovely. Another good option for vegetarians - are traiteurs, particularly around Ledru Rollin (down the road from Bastille) take away food where you can combine a range of different options such as pomme dauphinoise, dolmas, salads, vegetables, nice breads and cheeses and so on.\\n\\nLebanese restaurants and snack shops abound as well, offering a number of vegetarian ''mezze'', or small plates. The stand-bys of course are hummas, falafel, and baba-ganouche (''caviar d'aubergine''). A good place to look for Lebanese is in the pedestrian zone around Les Halles and Beaubourg in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]] and [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]].\\n\\nAlso look out for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) places, especially around Rue Mouffetard in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]''', where you can often get a tofu banh mi for less than a fiver.\\n\\n===Tourists and locals===\\n\\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually geared towards tourists. It does make a difference in the staff's service and behaviour whether they expect you to return or not.\\n\\nSometimes the advertised fixed price tourist menus (\\u20ac10-15) are a good deal. If you're interested in the really good and more authentic stuff (and if you have learned some words of French) try one of the small bistros where the French go during lunch time.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n\\nThe bars scene in Paris really does have something for everyone. From bars which serve drinks in baby bottles, to ultra luxe clubs that require some name dropping, or card (black Amex) showing, and clubs where you can dance like no one's watching, (although they will be). To start your night out right, grab a drink or two in a ubiquitous dive bar, before burning up the dance floor and spreading some cash, at one of the trendy clubs.\\n\\n*'''Canal St Martin'''. Many cozy caf\\u00e9s and other drinking establishments abound around the ''Canal St Martin'' in the '''[[Paris/10th arrondissement|10th]]'''.\\n*'''The Marais'''. The Marais has a large number of trendier new bars mostly in the '''[[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]]''' and to a lesser extent the '''[[Paris/3rd arrondissement|3rd]]''' with a few old charmers tossed into the mix. A number of bars and restaurants in the Marais have a decidedly gay crowd, but are usually perfectly friendly to straights as well. Some seem to be more specifically aimed at up-and-coming hetero singles.\\n*'''Bastille'''. There is a very active nightlife zone just to the northeast of Place de Bastille centered around ''rue de Lappe'', ''rue de la Roquette'', ''rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine'' (especially the amazing Club Barrio Latino) and ''rue de Charonne'' in the '''[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]'''. Many of the bars closest to Bastille have either a North, Central, or South American theme, with a couple of Aussie places mixed in for good measure, and as you continue up ''rue de Charonne'' the caf\\u00e9s have more of a traditionally French but grungy feeling.\\n*'''Quartier Latin - Odeon'''. If you're looking for the ''nouvelle vague'' (new wave) style, student and intellectual atmosphere of Paris in the 1960s and 70s, you'll find a lot of that (and more hip and chic) places in the quartier Latin and between place Odeon and the Seine. The neighbourhood is also home of many small artsy cinemas showing non-mainstream films and classics (check 'Pariscope' or 'l'officiel du spectacle' at any newspaper stand for the weekly programme).\\n*'''Rue Mouffetard and environs'''. The area in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]''' on the south side of the hill topped by the Panth\\u00e9on has a little bit of everything for the nighthawk, from the classy caf\\u00e9s of Place de la Contrescarpe to an Irish-American dive bar just down the way to a hip, nearly hidden jazz caf\\u00e9 at the bottom of the hill.\\n*'''Ch\\u00e2telet'''. In some ways the ''Marais'' starts here in the '''[[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]''' between ''Les Halles'' and ''H\\u00f4tel de Ville'' but with between all of the tourists and the '''venerable Jazz clubs''' on ''rue des Lombards'' the area deserves some special attention.\\n*'''Montmartre'''. You'll find any number of cozy caf\\u00e9s and other drinking establishments all around the ''Butte Montmartre'' in the '''[[Paris/18th arrondissement|18th]]''', especially check out ''rue des Abbesses'' near the ''M\\u00e9tro'' station of the same name.\\n*'''Oberkampf-M\\u00e9nilmontant'''. If you are wondering where to find the hipsters (''bobos'' for bohemian-bourgeois), then this is where to look. There are ''several'' clusters of grungy-hip bars all along ''rue Oberkampf'' in the '''[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]''', and stretching well into the '''[[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]]''' up the hill on ''rue de M\\u00e9nilmontant''. It's almost like being in [[San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco/Haight-Fillmore District|Haight-Fillmore]] district.\\n*'''Bagnolet'''. There are a cluster of bar/restaurant/nightclubs along the southern end of the P\\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in the [[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]] including probably the best place in Paris for nightly local and touring punk rock.\\n*'''Rues des Dames-Batignolles'''. Another good place to find the grungy-chic crowd is the northern end of the '''[[Paris/17th arrondissement|17th]]''' around ''rue des Dames'' and ''rue des Batignolles'', and if you decide you want something a little different Montmartre is just around the corner.\\n*'''Port de Tolbiac'''. This previously deserted stretch of the river Seine in the '''[[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th]]''' was reborn as a center for nightlife (and Sunday-afternoon-life) a few years ago when an electronic music cooperative opened the '''Batofar'''. Nowadays there are a number of boats moored along the same ''quai'', including a boat with a Caribbean theme, and one with an Indian restaurant.\\n*'''Saint Germain des Pr\\u00e9s'''. This area has two of the most famous caf\\u00e9s in the world: Caf\\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots, both catering to the tourists and the snobs who can afford their high prices. This part of the '''[[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]''' is where the Parisian caf\\u00e9 scene really started, and there still are hundreds of places to pull up to a table, order a glass, and discuss Sartre deep into the evening.\\n\\nFor individual bar listings see the various Arrondissement pages under '''Drink'''.\\n\\nOf course there are lots of interesting places which are sort of off on their own outside of these clusters, including a few like the '''Hemingway Bar at the Ritz''' which are not to be missed in a serious roundup of Parisian drinking, so check out the listings even in those arrondissements we haven't mentioned above.\\n\\nSome nightclubs in Paris that are worth it: Folies Pigalle (pl. Pigalle, 18th, very trashy, \\u20ac20), Rex Club (near one of the oldest cinemas on earth, the Grand Rex, house/electro, about \\u20ac15). You might also want to try Cabaret (Palais Royal), Maison Blanche, le Baron (M Alma-Marceau). Remember when going out to dress to impress, you are in Paris! Torn clothing and sneakers are not accepted. The better you look, the more likely you will get past the random decisions of club bouncers. Also important to remember if male (or in a group of guys) that it will be more difficult to enter clubs; try to always have an equal male/female ratio.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n=== Hotels ===\\nBeing often declared the most popular travel destination in the world, Paris has far over a thousand hotels to choose from, and even more in the surrounding [[Ile-de-France]] region. The choice may be overwhelming, but should be made carefully. There are huge differences in standards and location is key to make your stay in Paris enjoyable and time used well. Be prepared to pay the price for Paris' popularity - even the cheap hotels are relatively expensive.\\n\\nDespite the popularity with tourists, global hotel chains have relatively low penetration of the Parisian market. A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered. There is a fair amount of Best Westerns as well, but most international chains limit their presence to very few exclusive (and expensive) hotels in key locations. Travellers loyal to a particular brand may find their loyalty challenged, be forced to pay for it (rather than be rewarded) or unable to find their hotel brand of choice in Paris.\\n\\nHotels in the central arrondissements tend to be expensive, although very cheap ones can also be found. With few exceptions, they tend to offer small rooms - be aware of the fact that the difference in price between hotels can translate into difference in service, facility and appointment levels, but not necessarily room size. Rooms of 12-16 square metres (which is roughly half of standard hotels rooms e.g. in the USA) are the norm in central Paris, regardless of hotel standards.\\n\\nCheaper hotels in popular arrondissements tend to be older, less attractive properties, whose facilities and appointments may be very worn and outdated, far behind standards one would expect from the capital of all things pretty and fine. Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.\\n\\nHotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the ''Peripherique'' and Paris itself, can be far cheaper and better value for money than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, you should check thoroughly how far from the metro / RER station the given hotel is, and whether the connection to the POIs you want to visit is direct, quick and easy. Do also factor in the added cost of transportation to outer zones, as well as the time spent to travel to and from the city and obviously resulting limitations.\\n\\nBecause of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called \\\"''douche italienne''\\\" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.\\n\\nParis hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low seasons. These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around the Christmas season.\\n\\nFor individual hotel listings see the various [[#Districts|Arrondissement]] pages. <!-- please add individual hotel listings on the various Arrondissement pages -->\\n\\n=== Apartment rentals ===\\nFor those staying for a week or more, renting a furnished apartment might be a more comfortable and money-saving option, especially for 3 or more adults. Furnished apartments can differ considerably in location and quality, offer different accommodations and selections of appliances and kitchen features, or may be well-above street level with no elevator. Expect apartment sizes to be modest. Access to local public transport can also vary widely. So choose carefully only after getting a full description of an interesting property.\\n\\nMany websites will help you find rentals. Some do a more disciplined job of locating and describing properties and their locale. Most charge a commission of 10% or more; some offer insurance covering some risks. Some may offer a few apartments for shorter stays, usually at somewhat higher cost per day.\\n\\nIn late-spring and summer months, desirable properties may be in short supply. If your plans are fairly firm for those periods, you would be wise to \\\"reserve\\\" a unit well in-advance. Owners will often ask for a non-refundable deposit of up to 50% of the total cost of your stay. Means of payment can range from money order to PayPal or (occasionally) charge card. (Take great care of how and with whom you share any charge card account number.) You should send no payment to any post office box or similarly anonymous place or account...even after exchanging e-mails with a purported owner; most are no more than \\\"blind\\\" scams to take your money.\\n\\nThe city government has passed ordinances that require owners renting properties for short periods to collect a tax previously collected only by hotels. This substantial tax may not be collected by some owners, or may be demanded by them but not mentioned in their rates until you arrive. Tax enforcement and collection remain in a state of flux.\\n\\nSome agencies, rental brokers or web sites, that seem amicable, attractive or claim reputations, do not abide by French law to carefully vet and select landlords and apartments they offer for rent. There are a certain number of guarantees, which are required in France before renting an apartment, and an insurance policy, which aims at protecting the tenants during their stay.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Crime===\\nDespite what many naysayers might say or believe, Paris is still a relatively safe city. This does not stop it from being plagued by petty [[crime]], especially [[pickpocketing]], and muggings. Scams, of which there are many, are also prevalent, though the police are slowly cracking down on them. While not common, purse snatchings do happen. Violent crime is rare. However, watch yourself at ATMs and other places where your cash may be visible. Keep your money and your wallet in your front pockets, and avoid ATMs that are open to the outside, especially at night.\\n\\nAs a densely populated city with equally dense neighbourhoods, one would be remiss to generalise the safety of entire 'arrondissements' based on a few specific areas. Several arrondissements have their share of crime, however. The 18th, 19th, and 20th arrondissements are widely seen as the least safe areas of Paris, but safety levels vary dramatically from street to street. During the day, they're usually fine; you might have to watch out for pickpockets and scammers, but not much more. However, be on your guard at night. The 10th arrondissement (namely the areas bordering the 18th and 19th arrondissements) and the southeastern portion of the \\\"p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique\\\" have also gained a reputation for being sketchy.\\n\\nSeveral of the inner suburbs of the metropolitan area (commonly referred to as the ''banlieues'') such as La Courneuve, [[Saint-Denis (\\u00cele-de-France)|Saint-Denis]], Sarcelles, and Pantin are notoriously 'rough' by European standards, and you should be cautious when visiting these places. Unrest in those areas has made global headline news (as did the somewhat heavy-handed reactions of various French governments).\\n\\nThe police can be reached by phone by dialling 17. Not all police officers speak English, but those found around touristy areas almost always will. They are usually friendly and perfectly approachable should you have to.\\n\\n==== Theft in public transit ====\\nThe m\\u00e9tro and RER are also a popular place for pickpockets. '''Hold things tightly and be aware of your surroundings.''' While trains are usually crowded, if someone is insisting and hovers over you, they are probably going through your pockets. It is important to know that a majority of these belong to a gang. These gangs usually use young children as young as seven, with groups of them going around the metro stations pickpocketing tourists and locals alike. If there is a group of three or more suspicious looking people, be careful of your belongings. This is a notable occurrence on M\\u00e9tro line 13, tramways, and the RER B.\\n\\nCommon tactics are two of them blocking you as you try to board the subway, with two behind you quickly going through your bag. Seconds before the doors close, the two jump off, leaving you on the metro without even realizing what has happened. Take note of what locals do. If someone warns you to be careful, there are probably some suspicious types hoping to steal from you. Also be aware that phone-snatching is the most reported crime, and avoid using your cellphone on metro platforms and in the metro itself.\\n\\nPickpockets are active on the rail link (RER B) from Charles de Gaulle airport to downtown Paris, which passes through the poor suburbs of Seine-Saint Denis. Try to take the trains which are nonstop between the airport and Paris proper (Gare du Nord) - EKLI/EKIL from Paris to CDG and KRIN/KROL from CDG to Paris. These are faster and are less crowded than the alternative.\\n\\nThere have also been problems with thieves physically fighting people in order to steal their belongings. The most common targets are those with suitcases and backpacks, i.e. tourists. Thieves usually coin their acts with the closing of the doors. Newer trains have cameras everywhere, and thieves are much less likely to use them. Otherwise, stow luggage on the racks above the seat (which is not possible in newer trains) and hold on to your bags so no one can grab them and then run out. You are much less likely of being a victim if the train is crowded with locals headed to work, usually at rush hour.\\n\\nThe train conductors are widely aware of these crimes and will usually wait a few seconds to leave the station after the doors have closed, just in case thieves have quickly jumped off with belongings. There are also emergency cords that one can pull if willing to chase after the attackers. People will usually be helpful and gladly call the police if you do not have a cell phone.\\n\\n==== Theft in tourist hotspots ====\\nPickpockets are most likely to be found working at crowded tourists hotspots, so keep your wallet and phone in your front pockets and hold your backpack tightly when in a crowd.\\n\\nA common place for phone/camera/wallet snatching is in tourist friendly dining areas scattered all over Paris where exposed outdoor tables are commonly right on busy sidewalks. Common practice by many Western tourists is to leave an aforementioned item of value on the table (most commonly a smartphone) in front of them. Some of the criminals, working in groups of three to five people, approach your table and shove what appears to be a survey directly under your nose thus blocking your view of your valuable. While the gang members are yelling in a foreign language another one will slip a hand below your view and take your item of value from the table. This occurs very quickly (less than five seconds) and the perpetrators disappear around the corner just as quick as they arrived.\\n\\nKey landmarks like the Louvre or the Eiffel tower have been plagued with gangs of pickpockets, which typically operate in groups of about five. As many as half a dozen of these gangs may be active at a particularly famous, crowded venue at any one time; occasionally there are fights between rival gangs of thieves. Asian visitors are often targeted due to a presumption that they are visiting from affluent nations. Venue staff have complained of being spat at, threatened, abused or assaulted by pickpocketing gangs; the Louvre closed briefly in 2013 (as did the Eiffel tower in 2015) due to worker protests of unsafe conditions due to criminal activity. Token attempts to deploy more police have not solved the problems.<!-- http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32844573 -->\\n\\n==== Scams ====\\n[[File:People at Montmartre \\\"selling\\\" trinkets.JPG|right|thumb|The men who will try to tie strings on your fingers]]\\nAt Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur, there are many men who will try to tie strings or bracelets on your finger (often called \\\"string muggers\\\"). Not only will they demand an obscene fee for the cheap trinkets (usually over \\u20ac15), they will also try to pickpocket you or threaten you with force if you do not give them money. They are usually only at the base of the monument and can be avoided by taking the Funicular of Montmartre. Otherwise, you can quickly walk past them and ignore them, though they will readily grab people's arms and have even been known to target children of tourists. Yelling at them may cause unwanted attention and cause them to back off, but be careful. Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur appears to be the only area where they congregate, but they have been sighted also near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nBesides them, you will notice many people walking around with cheap trinkets at touristy areas, especially the Trocad\\u00e9ro, Eiffel Tower, and Louvre Museum. They are generally not rude, but buying things from them is illegal and hurts small businesses. Of course, they bolt at the sight of the police, and you may end up in the middle of a stampede!\\n\\nBe careful around Barb\\u00e8s-Rochechouart and the bars near Moulin Rouge. A very common [[clip joint]] trick is played here which might cost you up to \\u20ac500. The agents standing outside will force you to enter a bar and just have a look for 5 minutes. The moment you order a drink (about \\u20ac5), a girl will approach you and start talking generally, and leave in 10\\u201315 minutes. After a harmless conversation with the girls when you request a bill, you will encounter a charge of say \\u20ac200-500 as 'service fees' for the services rendered by the girl! In case you resist paying, the bouncers will start intimidating you to try to extract money from your wallet. In such cases, threaten them that you are calling the police and informing the local embassy. Try to buy some time and start creating a ruckus. However, do not try to start a fight with the bouncers. This trick is common to many European big cities.\\n\\nOne scam involves a \\\"helpful\\\" local buying a ticket for you. Normally, tourists buy 1-day, 3-day or longer Paris Visite passes. They would tell you that your single trip ticket has expired and bring you to the ticketing machine to purchase day passes. Then they would select the 3 day pass for adults (even though you may be a student) and deliberately show you the price on the screen. Everything else is in French so you would not understand a thing. They would proceed to purchase with a credit card and while entering the PIN code, get you to turn your back on them. They then sneakily change the ticket to a single trip ticket and ask for payment for a 3-day ticket from you. Unsuspecting tourists would pay the full sum thinking it is a 1-day or 3-day pass when it is only a useless ticket. Buy the tickets yourself to avoid situations like these, as machines are available in English and other languages. If you feel threatened, call the police and don't physically handle the ticket if they forcibly purchase without your agreement.\\n\\nAnother common scam is found along the banks of the Seine river and involves a ring. This involves thieves \\\"finding\\\" a ring which they give to you. They then ask you if you own it. When you say no, they insist you keep it, saying it goes against their religion or they cannot wear rings. A few moments later, they ask you for money to buy something to eat, eventually following you and becoming more annoying. You can either yell at them or steer them towards an area where there are likely to be police present, at which point they will quickly run away.\\n\\nThe most common scam (besides pickpocketing) that has taken over Paris by storm since June 2011 involves women coming up to tourists with pledge sheets. They pretend to be deaf people collecting money for one charity or another. Once you are distracted with the petition, an accomplice pickpockets you and takes your belongings. In addition, once you sign, they point to a thing that reads \\\"minimum ten euro donation.\\\" While they may at first insist on this, shaking your head and walking away will usually make them pester someone else. Otherwise, simply waving them off and a loud no should make them give up. If they are in a large group, as is common, be careful of your belongings! This is a ploy to pickpocket you as you are surrounded by them. At this point, yelling for the police will make them disperse quickly. This is most commonly found around major tourist sites, but has also been a problem at Gare du Nord, though this has gotten much better.\\n\\nNever bet money on a 3-card game as you will always lose. This trick is played by con artists on some of the bridges on River Seine near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nA more modern scam takes place on ride-sharing apps such as Bolt. The \\\"driver\\\" will send you a message, saying you need to provide your mobile number in order to \\\"confirm\\\" the booking (this is not true; no such rule exists). Once you have done so, they will then attempt to use your number to sign into an account on another app (such as Uber), and send you another message on the first app requesting your confirmation code (which you will have received in a text message from the second app after you gave out your number). They will use another made-up excuse (\\\"Uber now runs Bolt operations in Paris\\\") to talk you into doing this. If the scam is a success, they will have access your account, and can run up massive bills by booking rides in your name. As such, if you receive such a message, do not engage, just cancel the ride and report the driver as a scammer. The app should then refund your cancellation fee. \\n\\nIt is a good idea to steer clear of the suburb of Seine Saint-Denis, as this suburb is known for its gangs and poverty, though there is little of interest to tourists anyway (except the Basilique de Saint-Denis, but that is located near a m\\u00e9tro station). You may want to avoid walking alone at night in the 18th and 19th arrondissements as well, as these can be a little shady at night. There is a large problem with youths from the depressed suburbs causing trouble with the police. If locals are moving away, it is most likely from a confrontation. While these groups rarely target people besides the police, be careful. Walk away from a situation that could lead to fights or worse.\\n\\nIn general, remember to be aware of pickpockets, as they act by trying to distract you. Avoid showing off expensive phones or a lot of money in public transportation or in open areas. Put your things in a money belt or your front pockets, but never in the back pockets.\\n\\n====Danger for identifiably Jewish people====\\nParis has the largest Jewish community in Europe and the 6th largest in the world. However, antisemitic acts have increased in France since the early 2000s, culminating with the January 2015 \\u00cele-de-France attacks targeting a local kosher supermarket. Attacks on Jews have since decreased and as of 2023, there have been no recent reports of attacks against tourists of Jewish faith. After 2015, the French government assigned thousands of soldiers to guard synagogues and Jewish schools. Still, fearing harassment or attacks, many of the local Jews no longer wear a kippa/yarmulke in the street or public transportation. So consider taking the advice of local Jews regarding your behavior. For example, if you wear a kippa, consider wearing it under a hat that is not identifiably Jewish.\\n\\n==Respect==\\n\\nParisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant. While this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris still is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is \\\"''bien \\u00e9lev\\u00e9''\\\" (well brought up). It will make getting about considerably easier.\\n\\nParisians' abrupt exteriors will rapidly evaporate if you display some basic courtesies. A simple \\\"''Bonjour, Madame''\\\" when entering a shop, for example, or \\\"''Excusez-moi''\\\" when trying to get someone's attention, are very important; say \\\"''Pardon''\\\" or better \\\"''je suis d\\u00e9sol\\u00e9''\\\" if you bump into someone accidentally or make other mistakes. If you speak French or are using a phrasebook remember to always use the vous form when addressing someone you don't know; this may transform the surliest shop assistant into a smiling helper or the grumpiest inhabitant to a helpful citizen. Courtesy is extremely important in France (where the worst insult is to call someone \\\"''mal \\u00e9lev\\u00e9''\\\", or \\\"badly brought up\\\").\\n\\nIf you only learn one long phrase in French a good one would be \\\"''Excusez-moi de vous d\\u00e9ranger, monsieur/madame, auriez-vous la gentillesse de m'aider?''\\\" (pardon me for bothering you, sir/madam, would you have the kindness to help me?) - this level of extreme politeness is about the closest one can come to a magic wand for unlocking Parisian hospitality. If you know some French, try it! But remember, too, that Parisians have places to go and things to do, so if they have no time and don't answer you, don't take it personally. Many Parisians, given time, will go out of their way to help, especially if you make an effort to speak their language and act polite to them.\\n\\nMost foreigners tend to ignore two basic rules of courtesy in metro and train transport in Paris. If the carriage is full and you're sitting on a folding seat, you should consider standing up. If you stand next to the door, you are expected to get down to the platform at a stop so that people inside can find their way out.  Once they have got out, you can go back. However, don't always expect that others will do the same for you and, if the train is full, get ready to get down with enough time in advance. In a corridor, when pushing a door, you are expected to hold it for the next person, so that it won't close abruptly. This rule is strictly observed in the metro, and quite commonly everywhere else.\\n\\nIn addition, if you are traveling to or from the airport or train station and have luggage with you, make certain that you are not blocking the aisles in the train by leaving your bags on the floor. The RER B (which links both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports to the city) has luggage racks above the seats (on the newer trains, there are no such racks above the seats, but racks dedicated to luggage in between some seats); it is best to use them so you do not block the path of a local who is getting off the train before the airport stop. On the m\\u00e9tro and especially in the RER, don't take up extra seats with your luggage. There are luggage racks and spaces between the seats.\\n\\nThere are hefty fines for littering in Paris, especially with dog droppings (often you'll find free plastic bag dispensers around parks or playgrounds).\\n\\n==Connect==\\nAs of Sept 2021, Paris has 5G from all French carriers. Wifi is widely available in public places, transport, cafes and so on.\\n\\nOne helpful thing about having official and numbered districts in Paris is that you can easily tell which arrondissement an address is in by its postal code, and can easily come up with the postal code for a Paris address if you know its arrondissement. The rule is just pre-pend 750 or 7500 to the front of the arrondissement number, with 75001 being the postal code for the 1st and 75011 being the postal code for the 11th, and so on. The 16th has two postal codes, 75016 for the portion south of Rue de Passy and 75116 to the north; all other arrondissements only have one postal code.\\n\\nPhone cards are available from most \\\"tabacs\\\" but make sure you know where you can use them when you buy them, as some places still sell the ''cartes cabines'' which are hard to use as ''cabines'' are rare.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\nFamous for its status as \\\"fashion capital\\\", Paris isn't as conservative in dress as one might think. Parisians will tolerate all kinds of clothes as long as they're worn \\\"avec style\\\" (with style). That's why men do not usually wear shorts shorter than above the knee outside of sporting events: it is not considered indecent but may stand out from the locals; shorts are for \\\"schoolboys and football players\\\" only.\\n\\n===Airlines===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Adria Airways | url=http://www.adria.si | email=\\n| address=94 r Saint Lazare 75009 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= |

Built by Gustave Eiffel in 1887-1889, the tower was almost torn down in 1909 and only saved due to its use as a telegraphy antenna. The queues can be very long. The tower allows online reservations at its website. You can select a date and time frame. If you miss the time on your ticket, you have lost your money. The north, west, and east pillars have elevators that go to the first and second floors; the south pillar has stairs that can be climbed to the second floor. To reach the top floor, an additional elevator ride is required, and the wait for this can be very long as well. Disabled visitors are not allowed beyond the second floor due to safety concerns. Taking the M\\u00e9tro as far as Ecole Militiare and then strolling up the Champ de Mars is a lovely way to arrive at the tower. Another phenomenal approach is to exit the Metro at Trocadero and see the Eiffel Tower from the other side of the Ecole Militaire.\\n}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=l'Assembl\\u00e9e Nationale | alt= | url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/ | email=\\n| address=33, quai d'Orsay | lat=48.862192 | long=2.318716 | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 40 63 60 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=M F Sa 08:40-11:40 and 14:00-17:00 | price=\\n| wikipedia=National Assembly (France) | image=Paris Assemblee Nationale DSC00074.jpg | wikidata=Q193582\\n| content=Guided tours conducted all day, ID required.

The streets just northwest of Place de la Bastille are full of little bars which attract a mix of young suburban Parisians, expats, and foreigners.  Many have a Latin American theme. The restaurants, bars, and wine-bars around Rue Oberkampf in the north of the 11th and rue de Charonne near Avenue Ledru Rollin attract a more urban crowd and are perhaps closer to something traditionally Parisian, while capturing some of the grungy feel of drinking spots in up-and-coming inner city neighbourhoods everywhere.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Paris 11th - Quartiers.png|400px|thumbnail|right|''Quartiers'' of the 11th arrondisement]]\\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the 11th Arrondissement of Paris was an industrial area of factories and homes of factory workers. There was never an intent to build monuments other than local churches. Thus, there are few special places to ''see'' or unusual things to ''do''.\\n\\nIt was not until the mid-2000s that young Parisians began to move into the 11th because apartments were less expensive there than in other Parisian areas. With this influx, restaurants and bars proliferated in two areas, along and to the north of rue de la Roquette and around rue Oberkampf. With its history, the 11th is a place to ''eat'' and ''drink''. Within the 11th are several boutique hotels, restaurants and bars set in former factories.\\n\\nAs of 2015, the 11th arrondissement had about 150,000 residents, that is, 41,000 residents/km<sup>2</sup>, making it the most densely populated of all arrondissements of Paris (the next densest were the 18th and 20th, with about 33,000/km\\u00b2) and of all the urban districts in Europe. Because of the population density, public transportation is widely available.\\n\\nLike each Paris arrondissement, the 11th is divided into administrative ''quartiers''.\\n\\n# '''Quartier de la Folie-M\\u00e9ricourt''' with the north border of la rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, to the east by le boulevard de Belleville, to the west by blvd du Temple and the south by rue Oberkampf. This quartier is quite lively with many restaurants and bars frequented by young and upscale customers. It is known as a ''''BoBo'''' quartier (''bourgeois'', ''bohemian''), or a ''hipster'' neighborhood. That is, those who support ''bohemian'' values but lead ''bourgeois'' lives.\\n# '''Quartier Saint-Ambroise''' bordered to the north by rue Oberkampf, to the east by blvd M\\u00e9nilmontant, west by blvd des Filles-du-Calvaire and part of blvd Beaumarchais plus to the south by rue du Chemin-Vert. This quartier is rather calm and residential.\\n# '''Quartier de la Roquette''' has a border to the north of rue du Chemin-Vert, to the east by blvd M\\u00e9nilmontant and a part of blvd Charonne, to the west by a part of blvd Beaumarchais and Place de la Bastille and part of rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine. Many bars and restaurants can be found along rue de la Roquette that attract a young crowd.\\n# '''Quartier Sainte-Marguerite''' is bordered to the north and west by rue de Charonne, to the east by blvd Charonne, and the south by rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine. It is mainly a quiet residential area but there are some bars and restaurants along rue de Charonne and rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine worth researching.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{Mapframe|48.8594|2.3794|zoom=14}}\\n{{Mapshape}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q50716}}\\n\\n===By M\\u00e9tro===\\nStation {{marker|type=go|name={{station|R\\u00e9publique|3|5|8|9|11}}|long=48.86708|lat=2.365209}} is at the 11th arrondissement's northwestern corner.

Quite up-market and quiet, it is the largest arrondissement by both area and population. Housing over 230,000 inhabitants and providing around 150,000 jobs, it is dense with residential and office developments, including the high rise skyline of ''Front de Seine'' along the northern part of the 15th's bank of the river. On the other hand, it sees relatively little tourist traffic \\u2014 but that does not mean it is devoid of attractions.\\n\\nThe famous skyscraper ''Tour Montparnasse'' and the neighbouring railway station ''Gare Montparnasse'' are on the eastern border of the 15th arrondissement, although the actual district of ''Montparnasse'' is right across the border in the [[Paris/14th arrondissement|14th arrondissement]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Paris 15e arrondissement - Quartiers.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|The four administrative quarters of the 15th arrondissement]]\\nThe 15th arrondissement is further broken up administratively into four ''quartiers'': Grenelle, Necker, Saint-Lambert and Javel.\\n\\n'''Grenelle''' is the quarter closest to the [[Paris/7th arrondissement|7th arrondissement]] and thus directly neighbouring the ''Champ de Mars'' and the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, it houses many hotels advertising the proximity of the Tower. The waterfront part of Grenelle is home to the 1970s high-rise residential development of ''Beaugrenelle'', and the eponymous shopping mall. The more inland parts of the quarter are filled with 19th-century ''Haussmannian'' buildings, interspersed with some more modern ones.\\n\\nThe quarter of '''Necker''', situated between Grenelle and the quarter of ''Montparnasse'' of the [[Paris/14th arrondissement|14th arrondissement]], is home to some of the locations named after Montparnasse, most notably the ''Tour Montparnasse'' and ''Gare Montparnasse''. It also houses more large public service and commercial buildings, such as the expansive ''H\\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades''. Otherwise, it is full of late 20th-century residential buildings, with many fewer Haussmannian structures than Grenelle.\\n\\nThe southeast quarter of '''Saint-Lambert''' is most known for the ''Parc des expositions de la porte de Versailles'', which is one of the largest and most important exhibition centres in France and Europe.\\n\\nThe southwestern '''quartier Javel''' had long been an industrial area of Paris, but has been reclaimed as office, residential, and recreational over the decades. It contains the ''Parc Andr\\u00e9 Citro\\u00ebn'', created over the former Citro\\u00ebn factory grounds, and the Heliport of Paris in its southern extremity.<!--The 15th, the largest arrondissement of central Paris, remains heavily residential, up-market and quiet - not a great deal of obvious attractions for the traveller here, apart from the Montparnasse Tower (Tour Montparnasse). Some parts of the arrondissement are close to the Eiffel Tower which actually is in the 7th. Other sights include the Montparnasse Cemetery where Jean-Paul Sartre and Charles Baudelaire are buried, Theatre de la Gaite, and Theatre du Montparnasse. Montparnasse Station (Gare Montparnasse) is a busy hub serving southwest France as well as Spain and Portugal.

There are plenty of great ethnic restaurants, most often offering a better value for your money than in Dupont Circle, downtown, or Georgetown. These neighborhoods are good places to see the city at its most dynamic; people from all walks of life, culture, race, sexual orientation, immigrants, natives, transplants, etc. all converge here to have a good time.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[Image:Fountain - Meridian Hill Park.jpg|thumb|380px|The Meridian Hill Park Fountain]]\\n\\n'''Adams Morgan''' is north of [[Washington, D.C./Dupont Circle|Dupont Circle]] and the [[Washington, D.C./Shaw|U St Corridor]]. It is best known for the nightlife district on 18th St between Florida and Columbia Rd, which after midnight on weekends gets so packed full of revelers that it's hard to move down the sidewalk. It's more than that, though\\u2014it's a lovely, historic, culturally vibrant neighborhood, full of eccentric shopping, outdoor markets, great restaurants, and community murals! The name \\\"Adams Morgan\\\" is derived from the names of two formerly segregated area elementary schools \\u2014 the all-black now-defunct Thomas P. Morgan Elementary School and the all-white John Quincy Adams Elementary School.\\n\\n'''Mount Pleasant''', with a population of approximately 11,000 people, is more of a small town in the city. Mount Pleasant Street is full of small shops, bars, and restaurants, primarily serving Latin American food. Although 50% white, the population here is 25% Hispanic and is the cultural center of the city's Salvadoran population, although the vast majority of the area's enormous Salvadoran population lives ''outside'' the city proper. It is nice for a Saturday stroll to soak up the Latin vibes, see some ''chanchona'' bands, and delve into one of the city's famous ''pupuser\\u00edas''.\\n\\n'''Columbia Heights''', like much of the city, was devastated by the 1968 riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The neighborhood includes the '''Tivoli Theatre''', home of the GALA Hispanic Theatre, and the DCUSA shopping mall, which includes several major chain retailers including Target, Best Buy, Marshall's, and Bed Bath & Beyond. There are many restaurants, bars, and hipster hangouts, lending to a vibe as close to that of New York's [[Brooklyn/Williamsburg|Williamsburg]].\\n\\nColumbia Heights is marked dramatically on its southern border by a geological formation known as the '''Fall Line''', which runs along Florida Avenue. This steep escarpment divides America's Piedmont Plateau from the Tidewater region of Virginia. If you are looking for a good view of the city, head to the hill on 13th St just north of Florida near Cardozo High School. This natural formation is also responsible for the dramatic terraces and fountains of '''Meridian Hill''' aka '''Malcolm X Park''' which, aside from restaurants and bars, is the major point of interest in the neighborhood.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[Image:Adams Morgan map.png|thumb|300px]]\\n===By Metrorail===\\nFor more information on riding the Metrorail in Washington DC, see [[Washington DC#Get around]].\\n\\nThe closest stop to Adams Morgan is the '''Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan''' stop on the Red Line, which is actually a 10 minute walk from Adams Morgan's bars on 18th street. The '''Columbia Heights''' metro station on the Green Line is located at the main commercial intersection of Columbia Heights and is a few blocks from Mount Pleasant.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nThe following are the main bus routes operating in these neighborhoods, along with links to timetables and route maps. For more information on riding buses in Washington DC, see [[Washington DC#Get around]].\\n\\n* '''[https://buseta.wmata.com/m/index?q=52 #52, #53, and #54]''' operate north-south along 14th St from the [[Washington, D.C./East End|East End]] through [[Washington, D.C./Shaw|Shaw]] to the Columbia Heights metro station, and then north to the Takoma metro station in [[Washington, D.C./Brookland-Petworth-Takoma|Takoma]].\\n* '''[https://buseta.wmata.com/m/index?q=H4 #H2, #H3, and #H4]''' run east-west from the Cleveland Park Metro station on the Red Line [[Washington, D.C./Upper Northwest|Upper Northwest]] through Mount Pleasant, past the Columbia Heights metro station, the Washington Hospital Center, and on to Catholic University in [[Washington, D.C./Brookland-Petworth-Takoma|Brookland]].\\n* '''[https://buseta.wmata.com/m/index?q=L2 #L2]''' runs north from [[Washington, D.C./West End|West End]] through [[Washington, D.C./Dupont Circle|Dupont Circle]], then straight up 18th St in Adams Morgan before veering west to the Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan metro station in [[Washington, D.C./Upper Northwest|Upper Northwest]] and continuing past the National Zoo.\\n* '''[https://buseta.wmata.com/m/index?q=42 42]''' connects DC's downtown West End with the Mount Pleasant neighborhood. Like the L2, it begins at Farragut Square and travels north on Connecticut Ave, with stops in DuPont Circle, before turning right onto Columbia. The 42 has a handful of stops in Adams Morgan on Columbia Road before turning north into Mount Pleasant.\\n* '''[https://www.dccirculator.com/explore/where-we-go/woodley-park-adams-morgan/ D.C.

Adams Morgan, on the other hand, is packed. Since these neighborhoods have an above-average frequency of muggings, be careful when walking back to your car at night by yourself.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\nTaxis are easy to catch on the main drags in Columbia Heights and Mount Pleasant, and pretty much anywhere within Adams Morgan.\\n\\n==See==\\n[[Image:Mount Pleasant Historic District.jpg|thumb|250px|Mount Pleasant rowhouses]]\\n{{mapframe|38.9267|-77.0399|zoom=14}}\\n{{mapshapes|Q171221}}\\n{{mapmask| 38.91677,-77.04164 |38.91579,-77.04361 |38.91426,-77.04623 |38.91632,-77.04647 |38.91836,-77.04753 |38.91855,-77.04774 |38.91878,-77.04847 |38.91896,-77.04884 |38.91918,-77.04897 |38.92116,-77.05018 |38.92175,-77.04966 |38.92222,-77.04898 |38.92264,-77.04861 |38.92300,-77.04854 |38.92326,-77.04857 |38.92362,-77.04854 |38.92448,-77.04873 |38.92499,-77.04893 |38.92548,-77.04933 |38.92589,-77.04951 |38.92698,-77.04975 |38.92761,-77.04987 |38.92808,-77.04975 |38.92814,-77.04955 |38.92813,-77.04928 |38.92795,-77.04885 |38.92705,-77.04770 |38.92654,-77.04686 |38.92619,-77.04669 |38.92598,-77.04628 |38.92599,-77.04598 |38.92618,-77.04546 |38.92655,-77.04492 |38.92702,-77.04474 |38.92757,-77.04460 |38.92809,-77.04430 |38.92894,-77.04471 |38.92954,-77.04546 |38.93043,-77.04617 |38.93133,-77.04690 |38.93178,-77.04769 |38.93210,-77.04885 |38.93225,-77.05038 |38.93246,-77.05076 |38.93288,-77.05096 |38.93320,-77.05076 |38.93360,-77.04988 |38.93415,-77.04894 |38.93497,-77.04823 |38.93528,-77.04747 |38.93567,-77.04669 |38.93583,-77.04609 |38.93601,-77.04566 |38.93615,-77.04508 |38.93613,-77.04336 |38.93623,-77.04261 |38.93628,-77.04162 |38.93646,-77.04103 |38.93680,-77.04042 |38.93710,-77.03928 |38.93749,-77.03851 |38.93749,-77.03760 |38.93742,-77.03644 |38.93742,-77.03442 |38.93737,-77.03385 |38.93507,-77.02526 |38.93324,-77.02665 |38.93297,-77.02679 |38.93272,-77.02680 |38.92685,-77.02594 |38.92335,-77.02541 |38.92066,-77.02524 |38.92057,-77.02604 |38.92074,-77.02665 |38.92078,-77.02679 |38.92069,-77.02877 |38.91964,-77.03394 |38.91953,-77.03414 |38.91918,-77.03447 |38.91918,-77.03629 |38.91916,-77.03645 |38.91809,-77.04013 |38.91802,-77.04026 |38.91778,-77.04042 |38.91727,-77.04084 |38.91706,-77.04114 |38.91677,-77.04164 }}\\n[[Image:18th St map.png|thumb|200px|Bars and restaurants in Adams Morgan]]\\n<!--PRINT\\n[[Image:Adams Morgan map.png|]]\\n[[Image:18th St map.png|]]\\nPRINT-->\\n\\nThe '''Adams Morgan Heritage Trail''' is a 2-hour self-guided walking tour around the neighborhood.

The grounds have long been an esteemed commodity in the city, first surrounding an 1819 mansion that became President James Quincy's home following his presidency. Around 1900, Mary Foote Henderson, who owned the land, petitioned Congress to move the White House to or establish the Lincoln Memorial at Meridian Hill, since the National Mall was just north of the putrid stench of the mosquito and sewage-infested Washington City Canal in [[Washington, D.C./Waterfront|Waterfront]]. The plan didn't pass the House of Representatives. However, she did convince Congress to create a park and, in 1910, the federal government purchased the ground and later converted it into the extravagant Italianate park that you see today. After the 1968 DC riots, the park was a haven for open-air drug markets, which got worse and worse throughout the crack epidemic of the 1980s. Following the murder of a teenager in 1990, the community decided to take back control of the park, and organized regular citizen patrols throughout the day and night.

Various take out stores along the 18th St nightlife strip, between Columbia Rd and Florida Ave, serve enormous, greasy slices of pizza for around $8 per slice to hungry drunks until 4AM. There are different opinions about which of the jumbo slice pizza places is best, but the truth is that it's never good pizza --- but it can be very satisfying late at night if you need a quick fill, especially after drinking at the adjacent bars. The three most well-known pizza stores are [https://www.orderpizzamartmenu.com/ Pizza Mart] (2445 18th St NW), [https://www.jumboslicepizzamart.com/ Jumbo Pizza] (2341 18th St NW), and [https://www.pizzabolis.com/ Pizza Boli's] (1511 U St NW), a DC-area chain with a location in [[Washington, D.C./Shaw|Shaw]].\\n\\n[[Image:Adams Morgan Jumbo Slice.jpg|thumb|260px|Jumbo slice pizza]]\\n\\n'''Salvadoran Cuisine''', provided by the area's enormous Salvadoran community, is the food specialty of Columbia Heights and Mount Pleasant. There is one word that you will know after a visit, and that is '''''pupusa'''''. Pupusas are thick corn maize tortillas stuffed with soft cheese, cheese + loroco (a Salvadoran flower), squash, pork, refried beans, or all sorts of other things, then topped with pickled cabbage (''curtido'') and tangy red sauce. They generally cost $1.50-2.00 each, but you will need at least a few if you are hungry. '''''Pupusas revueltas''''' include more than one filling, such as bacon and cheese - a local favorite. They are delicious. Pupusas in D.C. are serious business; they are always cooked to order, and will take at least ten minutes to prepare. Someone will almost always speak some English, but it's a good idea to keep a little [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]] in your pocket (''dos pupusas de loroco con queso, por favor''). Aside from pupusas, look for '''''Salvadoran soups''''' and delicious '''''atoles'''''. An atol is somewhere between porridge, hot chocolate, and a milkshake, made from corn meal, most of the spices you'd expect in pumpkin pie, and occasionally chocolate.\\n\\nBeware Mexican food served in the Salvadoran restaurants, or anywhere in D.C., as there is virtually no Mexican immigrant community. With the exception of [https://www.taqueriadf.com/ Taquer\\u00eda Distrito Federal]{{Dead link|date=June 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} and [https://supertacosdc.com/ Super Tacos and Bakery], the Mexican dishes are inauthentic rubbish.

Regardless of your tastes, you should be sure to stop by the legendary New Orleans themed Madam's Organ, which offers live music every night of the week.\\n\\n===Bars/Lounges===\\n* {{drink\\n| name=A League of Her Own / Pitcher's Bar | url=https://www.pitchersbardc.com/ | email=\\n| address=2319 18th St NW | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1 202 733-2568 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Lesbian bar promoting a safe space for queer women.\\n}}\\n* {{drink\\n| name=Bedrock Billiards | url=http://www.bedrockbilliards.com/ | email=\\n| address=1841 Columbia Rd NW | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1 202 667-7665 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Offers billiards and shuffleboard and displays artwork by local artists.\\n}}\\n* {{drink\\n| name=Dan's Cafe | url= | email=\\n| address=2315 18th St NW | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1 202 265-9241 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Su-Th 7PM-2AM, F Sa 7PM-3AM | price=\\n| content=This family run operation is a true dive bar and most colorful bars in the city.

Historical monuments and markers dot the castle grounds, including several stone coffin lids used when materials were lacking during its construction. There's a bar/restaurant in the lower part of the main bailey, and an old-school coffee stand in the second bailey that are usually open whenever the owners feel like opening them (usually PM for the bar, morning/early afternoon for the coffee stand).

Expect a crowd of punks, bikers, and businessmen who had a long week at work all drinking and moshing together. Don't forget to wear ear protection, as this place gets extremely loud.\\n\\n== Do ==\\n* '''Hiking'''  - Mt. Hossaka (\\u5800\\u5742\\u5c71) looms over the city and is visible from almost anywhere. The mountain trail is great for people that are relatively new to hiking, as it isn't too rough or steep. From the summit, one can see as far as Nagoya on a clear day. \\n* '''Festivals''' - Seasonal festivals are held throughout the year. In particular, the 'Ujisato Festival' in November is quite the spectacle. Samurai march through the city streets and meet at the castle ruins to honor the former lord of Matsusaka.\\n\\n== Buy ==\\nMatsusaka has historically been a merchant city. It still continues this tradition to this day, and is a great place to shop for a variety of locally made goods. \\n* '''Souvenir Store''' - There's a souvenir store connected to the station and located right next to the JR entrance. If you're just passing through, it's a great place to pick up locally made snacks, sauces, crafts, and even a bottle of tea made from leaves grown in Iinan village.\\n* {{buy\\n| name=Bell Farm | alt=\\u677e\\u962a\\u8fb2\\u696d\\u516c\\u5712\\u30d9\\u30eb\\u30d5\\u30a1\\u30fc\\u30e0 | url=https://www.bellfarm.jp/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2024-03-06\\n| content=A short bus ride away from Matsusaka station, Bell Farm is a local agricultural park that is very popular with locals.

Kimono made from this cloth is unique and of great quality, but is extremely expensive. However, one can buy handkerchiefs, wallets, bags, and other goods made from the cloth at Matsusaka station.\\n\\n== Eat ==\\n[[File:Sliced Matsusaka wagyu beef.jpg|thumb|Matsusaka beef]]\\nPerhaps the main reason people visit Matsusaka is to eat some of the delicious food found at its prestigious restaurants. Matsusaka beef is the main attraction for most. The beef is regarded as nearly holy in nature, as every product that remotely includes it is marketed as 'Matsusaka beef'. This includes everything from rice crackers flavored with it to finely marbled choice cuts.\\n\\n=== Budget ===\\nFor those on a tight budget, most of the food people travel here for isn't exactly the cheapest. A cheap place to grab a snack is the takoyaki and taiyaki stand found on the main street near the station. Chain restaurants and mom-and-pop eateries with decent prices are found throughout the city.\\n\\n=== Mid-range ===\\n\\n* '''Kiosks''' - For those just passing through the city,  a simple and relatively inexpensive way to sample the beloved beef is to get a Matusaka beef bento from one of the kiosks in the station. Prices range from \\u00a51000 to \\u00a52000. You'll know them when you see them because the lunchboxes are shaped like cattle heads. Matsusaka castle is a great place to eat them.\\n* '''Asanoya''' ''' (\\u6d45\\u91ce\\u5c4b)''' - For pescatarians, or anyone who prefers seafood to meat, this place is a little restaurant that specializes in tuna. About a five-minute walk from the JR side of Matsusaka Station.\\n* '''Asiam (\\u30a2\\u30b8\\u30e3\\u30e0)''' - Great Thai restaurant located a short walk away from the Kintetsu side of Matsusaka station. Small portions, but relatively cheap.\\n* '''Aji Oimatsu (\\u5473\\u8001\\u677e)''' - A bento (lunchbox) store located along the main road on the JR side of Matsusaka station. The bento sold here are made by the local Okha High School students who are studying to become chefs. These students even served the First Ladies during the 2016 G7 summit. Prices here are expensive, but the quality is fantastic and the funds go towards a good cause.\\n* '''Otomoni Coffee (\\u30aa\\u30c8\\u30e2\\u30cb\\u30b3\\u30fc\\u30d2\\u30fc)''' - Great for lunch. English-speaking staff and a menu with both western, Japanese, and fusion food. Coffee is expensive, but of excellent quality. Also serves as a hostel. 10-minute walk from the JR side of Matsusaka station.\\n* '''Cafe Hunky Dory (\\u30ab\\u30d5\\u30a7 \\u30cf\\u30f3\\u30ad\\u30fc\\u30c9\\u30ea\\u30a3)''' - Near Tokuwa Station (one stop down from Matsusaka JR station). This place is a bar, cafe, and restaurant all in one. The owner is a friendly man who is very passionate about food and fashion. Connected to the restaurant is a clothing store where he sells handmade clothes that he designed. Just ask him for a recommendation and he'll whip up something delicious.\\n\\n=== Splurge ===\\n\\n* '''Wadakin (\\u548c\\u7530\\u91d1)''' - The premier place to eat Matsusaka beef. Be prepared to pay between \\u00a513,000 to 30,000 for a course meal. You get what you pay for, though. \\n* '''Chez Nyaqu (\\u30b7\\u30a7\\u30fb\\u30cb\\u30e3\\u30c3\\u30af)''' - French-Japanese cuisine. Beautiful building and atmosphere with ivy covering the outside and an interesting interior that combines traditional Japanese and old fashioned French furniture. The chef studied in Provence and apparently the local French guy goes to eat there when he's homesick, so it must be pretty good.\\n\\n== Drink ==\\nMatsusaka has a vibrant nightlife, though a bit different from the youthful clubs of Osaka and Tokyo. The bars and clubs here are marketed towards a more middle aged working class audience. While not as energetic as a place such as Dotomburi or Roppongi, there's a genuinely friendly atmosphere in most of the local watering holes.\\n\\n* '''Popcorn''' - Right outside Matsusaka station on the JR side. Owner/bartender is a friendly and funny man that speaks English well. Drinks are quite expensive, but he makes them very strong.\\n* '''Gappa Ramones''' - This little hole in the wall is a true gem of an establishment if you like punk music. The restaurant is decked out in punk memorabilia and everything from local underground metal to The Pogues is played on the speakers there.\\n* '''Posse''' - A brand new bar with a modern vibe to it. Like the aforementioned Gappa Ramones, the bartender has a penchant for heavy metal, so you'll often hear it playing.\\n* '''Shots Bar Owl'''  - A cozy little bar hidden away in an alley near Matsusaka station. For some reason, they always have an Audrey Hepburn movie playing on the television with smooth jazz in the background.\\n* '''Wally Cook''' - Right in front of Matsusaka station on the Kintetsu side. Japanese style izakaya with a modern vibe to it. Food is pricy, but decent.\\n\\n== Sleep ==\\nMost accommodation in Matsusaka is geared toward business trips, so you'll find a wide variety of mid-range hotels in the city. However, both an excellent hostel is available for people on a budget, as well as a renowned ryokan for those who can afford it.\\n\\n=== Budget ===\\n\\n* '''Lodger/Otomoni Coffee''' - A hostel that's perfect for backpackers or light travellers to stay. The staff speaks English and has a plethora of information regarding local sightseeing and events. A bit more expensive than the average hostel (around \\u00a53000 per night), but the atmosphere is great and you get a discount if you drink there in the evening.\\n\\n=== Mid-range ===\\n\\n* '''Toyoko Inn''' - Located right next to the station on the JR side. It's a Japanese chain hotel with clean, comfy rooms. \\n* '''AU Hotel''' - A short distance from the Kintetsu side of Matsusaka station, this hotel has a great rooftop bar and restaurant.\\n\\n=== Splurge ===\\n\\n* '''Yachiyo (\\u516b\\u5343\\u4ee3)''' - Historical Ryokan built in the 1920s. Expensive, but, you get what you pay for. This place has nearly a century old reputation for its fine dining and authentic Japanese atmosphere. If unfamiliar with this type of establishment, see the [[Ryokan]] section on the general Japan page.\\n\\n== Stay safe ==\\nMatsusaka, like most Japanese cities, is extremely safe and crime against tourists is practically unheard of.\\n\\nThe city has a large red light district known as 'Atago-machi' that locals will claim is very dangerous, but it's not really the case. You'll definitely know if you wander into this district, but at the very worst you might get solicited (a simple 'no thank you' will always suffice), or hear a drunken businessman singing terrible karaoke through a thin wall. Avoid places with 'snack' in the name, unless you want to pay exorbitant prices for watered down drinks poured by pretty girls.\\n\\nDo not go to the Matsusaka castle ruins after dark, unless there is an event going on. The walls are extremely steep with no guard railing, so it's very easy to lose your step.\\n\\nPeople in Matsusaka can drive somewhat erratically compared to other places, so be careful along narrow and dark roads.\\n\\n== Go next ==\\nMatsusaka is centrally located in Mie Prefecture, so it's a decent base for travel no matter where you want to go in Mie.

Older folks will want to visit too, to see '''Meiji Shrine''' (''Meiji Jing\\u016b'') and '''Yoyogi Park'''.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nThe broad, tree-lined avenue leading downhill from the southern end of the JR station is '''Omote-sand\\u014d''' (\\u8868\\u53c2\\u9053), which leads to the upscale [[Tokyo/Aoyama|Aoyama]] district. The street is full of cafes and clothing stores. For teenagers, though, the place to be is '''Takeshita-dori''', which is a bustling narrow street several blocks to the north.\\n\\nNearby '''Yoyogi Park''' (\\u4ee3\\u3005\\u6728\\u516c\\u5712 ''Yoyogi-k\\u014den'') was the site of the first successful powered aircraft flight in Japan, on December 19, 1910, by Captain Yoshitoshi Tokugawa, following which it became an army parade ground. During the postwar occupation, it was the site of the Washington Heights residence for U.S. officers. It later was selected as the site for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and the distinctive Olympic buildings designed by Kenzo Tange are still nearby. In 1967, it was made into a city park.  Today, the park is a popular hangout, especially on Sundays, when it is used as a gathering place for people to play music, practice martial arts, etc. The park has a bike path, and bicycle rentals are available. As a consequence of Japan's long recession, there are several large, but surprisingly quiet and orderly, homeless camps around the park's periphery.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{mapframe|35.671|139.703|zoom=14}}\\n{{Mapmask|35.6689,139.6910|35.6678,139.6918|35.6682,139.6933|35.6684,139.6998|35.6693,139.7024|35.6645,139.7017|35.6638,139.7040|35.6613,139.7078|35.6630,139.7104|35.6642,139.7087|35.6652,139.7097|35.6658,139.7102|35.6670,139.7113|35.6672,139.7110|35.6698,139.7133|35.6705,139.7137|35.6719,139.7127|35.6733,139.7125|35.6757,139.7127|35.6746,139.7070|35.6777,139.7060|35.6795,139.7047|35.6805,139.7045|35.6800,139.7009|35.6810,139.6985|35.6809,139.6975|35.6801,139.6961|35.6797,139.6947|35.6773,139.6936|35.6742,139.6914|35.6697,139.6908|35.6689,139.6910}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q682894}} <!-- Tokyo Metro -->\\n{{Mapshapes|Q247782}} <!-- Toei Subway -->\\n{{Mapshape|title=Rinkai Line|wikidata=Q225095|type=geoline|stroke=#00b48d|stroke-width=4|stroke-opacity=1}}\\n{{Mapshape|title=Tokyo Monorail|wikidata=Q8015774|type=geoline|stroke=#ff0000|stroke-width=4|stroke-opacity=1}}\\n\\n===By train===\\n'''JR Harajuku Station''' on the Yamanote Line is the obvious way to get to Harajuku.

The subway is better than JR for getting here from central Tokyo, but the Yamanote Line is easier if you are coming from Tokyo Station. The nearby '''Omotesando''' Station (on the Ginza and Hanzomon subway lines) is further down Omote-sand\\u014d near the intersection with Aoyama-dori. Omotesando station has a variety of boutiques and restaurants in the underground station complex named Echika Omotesando.\\n\\n===On foot===\\nHarajuku is 15 minutes away from [[Tokyo/Shibuya|Shibuya]] by foot, just follow the train tracks along Koen-dori from the scramble crossing.

Each group stakes out its territory around '''Yoyogi Park''' (\\u4ee3\\u3005\\u6728\\u516c\\u5712 ''Yoyogi-k\\u014den''). Keep in mind that Harajuku is well known worldwide, so many tourists show up on Sundays. Best to be a bit early to avoid being stuck between big tourist groups.\\n\\n* The bridge across the train tracks sometimes has teenagers dressed up as '''Gothic Lolita''' and other extreme Japanese youth fashions. Besides just hanging out with friends, many come here to be snapped by the magazine photographers who mingle. Unfortunately, as of lately, the police seem to be cracking down on loitering, so they are becoming increasingly rare.\\n* Over by the entrance to the park, people with greased hair listen to '''rockabilly''' music and dance in their vintage jeans. This subculture has been around since the early 1980s.\\n* The sidewalks along the south side are usually occupied by '''junk vendors''' and loud '''rock bands'''. Both of these groups periodically get swept away by police crack-downs, though.\\n* The tree-lined area leading from the south end of the park to Shibuya is filled with all sorts of '''street performers''', mostly folk-pop singers, but also including hip-hop dancing and street theater.\\n\\n===Shrines===\\n[[File:MeijiShrine_Maiden.JPG|thumb|250px|Shrine maiden at Meiji Jingu, offering a bit of serenity among all the surrounding commerce]]\\n[[File:Meiji Shrine, Barrels of sake.jpg|thumb|Meiji Shrine, barrels of sake]]\\n\\n* {{see\\n| name=Meiji Shrine | alt=\\u660e\\u6cbb\\u795e\\u5bae ''Meiji Jing\\u016b'' | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.676111 | long=139.699167 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=Free\\n| content=Tokyo's grandest Shinto shrine, built in 1920 to commemorate the late Emperor Meiji, who oversaw Japan's rapid industrialization and rise to major world power status in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

On summer weekends you have a very good chance of catching a Japanese wedding in progress here; the shrine is also packed on New Year's Eve when people come here to celebrate the new year. An excellent place for those who wish to experience an oasis of tranquility among the hustle and bustle of the rest of the area.

There is very little of interest beyond this point, so one option is to walk back down Omote-sand\\u014d and return to Harajuku. If you elect to go forward then turn right on Aoyama-Dori and you will eventually pass United Nations University on your right, and Aoyama Gakuin University on your left, before continuing down and finishing up at Shibuya's world-famous pedestrian crossing.\\n\\nAllow yourself approximately two hours for this walk.\\n\\n===Bicycling===\\n\\n* {{do\\n| name=Yoyogi Park | alt=\\u4ee3\\u3005\\u6728\\u516c\\u5712 Yoyogi-k\\u014den | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Has a bike path and bicycle rentals are available.\\n}}\\n\\n===Salons===\\n\\nHarajuku and Omote-sand\\u014d are home to many upscale beauty salons, with prices to match.\\n\\n* {{do\\n| name=VIRGO | url=http://www.virgo-hair.com/ | email=\\n| address=2-32-3 Jingumae | lat= | long= | directions=near the BEAMS Harajuku branch\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Actresses and models sometimes use this salon.\\n}}\\n\\n==Buy==\\n[[File:Takeshita SexyDynamite.JPG|thumb|Sexy Dynamite and more, at Takeshita-d\\u014dri]]\\n[[File:OmotesandoHills Outside.JPG|thumb|Omotesando Hills, upscale shopping on Omote-sand\\u014d]]\\n\\nHarajuku has two major shopping streets, which couldn't be more different to each other: ''Takeshita-d\\u014dri'' and ''Omote-sand\\u014d''.\\n\\nThe {{marker |type=buy | name=Takeshita-d\\u014dri | lat=35.67142 | long=139.70375}} (\\u7af9\\u4e0b\\u901a\\u308a) targets teens and preteens.

This article expands the area to include Ratchaprasong, Phloen Chit Road and Chulalongkorn University.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Siam Sqaure 23-2-2008 P2.JPG|thumb|300px|Sensory overload at Siam Square Soi 7]]\\nWhile [[Bangkok/Rattanakosin|Rattanakosin]] represents Thailand's history and culture, '''Siam Square''' represents Thailand as a newly industrializing economy. Siam Square's first buildings were only constructed in the 1970s, on land of '''Chulalongkorn University''' which tried to get some extra rental income for the university. It started with ordinary shops, but has since expanded to a shopping and entertainment mecca that has everything upper-class teenagers and college students could possibly want \\u2014 luxury shopping malls and glitzy department stores filled with designer labels and hip fashion boutiques.\\n\\nDespite the name, it is not a square in the traditional sense. It could better be described as a warren of small sois filled with hundreds of tiny boutiques, restaurants, caf\\u00e9s, record stores and bookshops, mostly catering to upper-class 20-something Thais, shopping-spree Malaysians, and working ex-pats. If you're not up for a trip to the Gap or a pink martini, it's still worth a visit just to see the Bangkok-of-the-future. The area north of Rama I Road does feature some kind of courtyard on the second floor, which functions as the entry point for the '''Siam Center''', '''Siam Discovery''' and '''Siam Paragon''' shopping malls.\\n\\nGoing east on Rama I Road, the shopping experience continues at '''Ratchaprasong''', an area that received worldwide fame when red shirt-wearing political protesters set up their camp here in May 2010. It is home to '''CentralWorld''', the largest shopping mall in Thailand, which was set on fire during these protests, though it was restored within a few months. It gets more quiet as Rama I Road changes its name into '''Phloen Chit Road''' in the east. There are some shops and restaurants here, but the area is mostly home to foreign embassies and airline offices.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{mapframe|13.744431|100.533139|zoom=14}}\\n{{Mapmask|13.7357,100.5343|13.7351,100.5388|13.7344,100.5386|13.7340,100.5459|13.7339,100.5515|13.7483,100.5498|13.7483,100.5479|13.7487,100.5440|13.7489,100.5428|13.7493,100.5416|13.7496,100.5385|13.7496,100.5362|13.7493,100.5350|13.7491,100.5329|13.7492,100.5311|13.7493,100.5295|13.7496,100.5276|13.7495,100.5269|13.7492,100.5255|13.7492,100.5252|13.7494,100.5249|13.7499,100.5242|13.7523,100.5201|13.7526,100.5190|13.7531,100.5174|13.7516,100.5173|13.7488,100.5169|13.7456,100.5163|13.7424,100.5158|13.7412,100.5157|13.7406,100.5199|13.7402,100.5224|13.7390,100.5222|13.7386,100.5252|13.7356,100.5247|13.7342,100.5341|13.7357,100.5343}}\\n{{mapshapes|Q806501}} <!-- BTS -->\\n{{mapshapes|Q806485}} <!-- MRT -->\\n{{mapshape|title=Airport Rail Link (ARL)|wikidata=Q1133704|type=geoline|stroke=#761f21|stroke-width=4|stroke-opacity=1}}\\n{{infobox|Printable Maps|[[:File:Siamsquare-map.png|Map of the Siam Square area]]}}\\n\\n===By public transit===\\n\\nSiam Square is the most central neighbourhood of Bangkok and can be reached by both the Sukhumvit Line and the Silom Line of the BTS Skytrain system. The easiest entry point is '''Siam''' station, right on top of Siam Square and in the middle of the Siam area. It acts as the exchange station between the lines, so expect a lot of commuters during rush hour. The Sukhumvit Line continues east and passes '''Chit Lom''' station, which is close to Ratchaprasong, and '''Phloen Chit''' which serves the road of the same name. One stop west of Siam on the Silom Line is '''National Stadium''', a handy stop that's close to MBK Center, Siam Discovery, Jim Thompson's House and the cheap guest houses at Soi Kasemsan 1.\\n\\nThe Sukhumvit Line and the Silom Line provide direct connections with the districts of the same name. There is also a direct connection with [[Bangkok/Phahonyothin|Phahonyothin]] and the Chatuchak Weekend Market if you take the Sukhimvit Line to the north. If you're coming from [[Bangkok/Rattanakosin|Rattanakosin]] or [[Bangkok/Khao San Road|Khao San Road]], you'll first need to take the Chao Phraya Express Boat to '''Sathorn''' pier. From there, continue your way along the Silom Line to Siam station. The whole ride takes around 40 minutes (but is easier than trying to find the right bus!)\\n\\nThe quickest way to get to Siam from Suvarnabhumi Airport is by '''Airport Rail Link'''. Take the City Line to Phaya Thai station, a ride that takes 26 minutes. Then switch onto the BTS Sukhumvit Line towards Bearing and ride it to Siam station. As the systems are not integrated, you will have to buy a new ticket at Phaya Thai station.\\n\\n===By boat===\\n\\nIf you're staying at [[Bangkok/Khao San Road|Khao San Road]], the '''Saen Saep Express Boat''' is your best bet to get to Siam Square. It is only a short walk to the Golden Mount in [[Bangkok/Rattanakosin|Rattanakosin]], where you can get on the boat. The service operates every day from 05:30 to 20:30. The Golden Mount Line brings you to '''Sapan Hua Chang''' pier for Siam Square, and terminates at '''Pratunam''' pier (for Ratchaprasong intersection). You can switch to the NIDA Line at Pratunam pier, which brings you to '''Chitlom''', '''Wireless''' and on to [[Bangkok/Sukhumvit|Sukhumvit]] and [[Bangkok/Ramkhamhaeng|Ramkhamhaeng]]. A single trip from '''Panfa Leelard''' pier at the Golden Mount to '''Sapan Hua Chang''' takes about 25 minutes and costs around 9 baht.\\n\\n===By bus===\\n\\nSiam Square is among the most congested districts of Bangkok. Combine that with the complexity of the bus system, and it's obvious that you're better off using other ways of transport. However, if you're coming from or going to the '''Grand Palace''' area in [[Bangkok/Rattanakosin|Rattanakosin]], the bus is the only way to get a direct connection. Bus '''15''' starts at Phra Athit Road and then drives over Ratchadamnoen Klang Road (for [[Bangkok/Khao San Road|Khao San Road]]), Lan Luang Road, Chakkaphatdi Phong Road and Bamrung Muang Road before arriving at MBK Center, Siam Square and Ratchaprasong intersection. This bus then continues to [[Bangkok/Silom|Silom Road]], so take it in the other direction if you're coming from there.\\n\\nAn alternative is bus '''47''', which starts at Rama IV Road in Khlong Toei and then heads to Silom and over Phaya Thai Road. Get off at MBK Center. You can also take this bus from Tha Chang in [[Bangkok/Rattanakosin|Rattanakosin]] (near the Grand Palace) from which it goes through Ratchadamnoen Klang Road (for Khao San Road), Lan Luang Road, Chakkaphatdi Phong Road and Bamrung Muang Road. Get out at MBK Center as this bus won't continue its way further along Siam Square.\\n\\nThere is no reasonable bus connection from Suvarnabhumi Airport. You can take bus '''552''' to On Nut BTS station in [[Bangkok/Sukhumvit|Sukhumvit]] and continue with the Skytrain. It's a long bus ride and depending on traffic it could take 1-2 hours.\\n\\n==See==\\n\\n*{{see\\n| name=Bangkok Art and Culture Centre | alt=\\u0e2b\\u0e2d\\u0e28\\u0e34\\u0e25\\u0e1b\\u0e27\\u0e31\\u0e12\\u0e19\\u0e18\\u0e23\\u0e23\\u0e21\\u0e41\\u0e2b\\u0e48\\u0e07\\u0e01\\u0e23\\u0e38\\u0e07\\u0e40\\u0e17\\u0e1e\\u0e21\\u0e2b\\u0e32\\u0e19\\u0e04\\u0e23 | url=http://www.bacc.or.th/ | email=\\n| address=939 Rama I Rd | lat=13.746701 | long=100.530224 | directions=BTS National Stadium\\n| phone=+66 2 214-6630 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Tu-Su 10:00-22:00 | price=Free\\n| wikipedia=Bangkok Art and Culture Centre | image=Bangkok Art and Culture Centre building.jpg | wikidata=Q1130188\\n| content=Visitors can interact with different kinds of arts, such as performance arts, music, painting and film, in various ways.

It was named after the bloodthirsty race of pirates who prowled in the Straits before the arrival of the British. The area where Bugis Junction now stands was the original home of Singapore's small Hainanese community, famous for their large contribution to Singapore's culinary culture, before they moved to Beach Road in the early 20th century to make use of the docks and seafront. The area was then taken over by Singapore's Japanese community, and was originally populated by girls from poor families in Japan who were trafficked to Singapore to work as prostitutes. The Japanese community then grew and in their heyday just prior to World War II, were running many businesses and even had their own school and newspaper. However, the British repatriated all ethnic Japanese in Singapore after World War II, and did not allow any ethnic Japanese to enter Singapore for the next few years, thus spelling a temporary end for the Japanese community in Singapore. (The Japanese came back eventually, but these days they hang out around [[Singapore/Riverside|Robertson Quay]].)\\n\\nFor a long time after the war, the area was Singapore's equivalent of [[Bangkok/Patpong|Patpong]], a red-light district known for its bars and transvestite prostitutes or ''katies'' (the anglicized version of the Thai ''kathoey''), and was a popular hangout spot for American soldiers on their days off during the [[Indochina Wars|Vietnam War]]. However, in 1985 the area was redeveloped with a vengeance, turning it into a sanitised shopping experience for the whole family.\\n\\nNeighboring '''Kampong Glam''', also known by the name of its main thoroughfare '''Arab Street''', was where Singapore's Arab traders settled in the founding days of the colony, and was also the part of town allocated to the Malays when Raffles drew up his town plan. But here too, the original inhabitants fled in the 1920s as real estate prices drove through the roof, and today the heart of Muslim Singapore beats in Geylang Serai on the [[Singapore/East Coast|East Coast]].\\n\\nSo what's left then? A slice of modern Singapore at its most hyperactive: hundreds upon hundreds of shops and restaurants, several attractive promenades, and a bazaar selling the cheapest T-shirts in town.

It is most famous for the October 1600 Battle of Sekigahara, but its picturesque location nestled in a small valley between mountains, combined with its complete lack of large tour buses, makes it a nice day trip from the larger nearby cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Nagoya]], and [[Kanazawa]]. The small size of the town and the well-marked paths between historic sites makes Sekigahara even more appealing, as a visitor can traverse the entire battlefield in about a day.\\n\\nYou will need a solid understanding of Japanese, or a good translator, if you wish to interact with the town on a deeper level, but English-language material is available in the museums and on historical signs by the sites.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Sekigaharascreen.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the Battle of Sekigahara]]\\n\\nSekigahara was the site of the epic '''Battle of Sekigahara''' (\\u95a2\\u30f6\\u539f\\u5408\\u6226  ''Sekigahara gassen'') between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Ishida Mitsunari, representing Toyotomi Hideyoshi's son and designated successor Toyotomi Hideyori. The Cliff's Notes version: Ishida's Western Alliance had 120,000 troops against the 75,000 of Tokugawa's Eastern Alliance, but Tokugawa cleverly exploited various grievances in Ishida's ranks to convince six ''daimyo'' (regional warlords) to defect along with some 23,000 troops, tipping the scales of the battle. A mere two hours after the battle began on the morning of October 21, 1600, the Western Alliance was in tatters and a total of some 40,000 lay dead. Ishida escaped but was captured and executed on November 6th.\\n\\nTokugawa's victory on heralded the beginning of the Edo Period, and with it the rise of the Shogunate. The destruction of most of the forces of the Western Alliance allowed Tokugawa to rapidly consolidate control of Japan within the following four months, as previously-Western or neutral daimyos either joined with Tokugawa or were crushed by him. Consequently, the town is filled with ruins, memorials and shrines to the dead. (There is a river called Kurochigawa (\\u9ed2\\u8840\\u5ddd, \\\"Black Blood River\\\"), where the Tokugawa armies washed the cut-off heads of those fallen in battle, but the name had originated in the Jinshin War in the 7th century under similar circumstances.) \\n\\nToday's Sekigahara is a rural town with a population just over 7,000. Due to its historical significance, Sekigahara is sister cities with both [[Waterloo]] in [[Belgium]] and [[Gettysburg]] in the [[United States of America|US]]. It can also be inundated with Japanese tourists (particularly schoolchildren) because of its importance in Japanese history during certain parts of the Japanese school year.\\n\\n===Tourist information===\\n* {{Listing|name=Sekigahara Tourist Information Center|alt=\\u95a2\\u30f6\\u539f\\u99c5\\u524d\\u89b3\\u5149\\u4ea4\\u6d41\\u9928 Sekigahara ekimae kank\\u014d k\\u014dry\\u016b-kan|address=598-4, Sekigahara|lat=35.363542|long=136.470854|hours=09:00-17:00, closed Tu and the day after a holiday|lastedit=2024-05-02|content=The main tourist information center in town.

The Emmy-winning [[:w:Sh\\u014dgun (2024 TV series)|2024 TV series]] based on the book is also well worth a watch.\\n\\nThe classic samurai novel ''Musashi'' by Eiji Yoshikawa ({{ISBN|156836427X}}), about the real exploits of the eponymous famous swordsman, starts where Shogun ends, with Musashi fighting on the losing side at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:Battlefield of Sekigahara viewed from Ibukiyama Drive Way.jpg|thumb|Sekigahara as viewed from Ibukiyama Driveway (looking east). The battlefield and memorials are spread across the town, in the fields, and on the mountaintops.]]\\n\\nThe JR Tokaido Shinkansen line passes through Sekigahara on its way from [[Osaka]] to [[Nagoya]], but it does not stop in the town.  If coming from [[Kyoto]] (as most Western tourists tend to do), take the Shinkansen to Maibara, and then change to the JR Tokaido Line. The Shinkansen leg takes 19 minutes and the Tokaido leg takes 21 minutes, so the trip can be done in about an hour or even quicker if you time it right with trains. Make sure to take the ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' Shinkansen, as that will stop at every station (the other Shinkansen do not stop at Maibara). Maibara is the first stop going east from Kyoto on the ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' Shinkansen. If traveling on a Seishun 18 ticket or other pass that does not permit use of the Shinkansen, take the Special Rapid (\\u65b0\\u5feb\\u901f) to Maibara and change to the JR Central portion of the Tokaido line. When using the Special Rapid train, the JR West leg takes 1 hour 7 minutes. \\n\\nIf coming from Tokyo, one of two hourly ''Hikari'' services from Tokyo stops at Maibara, and you can transfer to the Tokaido Line local for the run to Sekigahara (total time 3 hours, &yen;12,070, no charge with JR Pass).\\n\\n{{go\\n| name=Sekigahara Station | alt=\\u95a2\\u30b1\\u539f\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.36372 | long=136.46998 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2024-05-02\\n| content=is a small unstaffed rural station, with two platforms (four trains) and one entrance/exit on the south side of the tracks. Within the building there are a few vending machines and restrooms. Other than that, there's nothing else in the station (no restaurants, shops, etc.).\\n}}\\n\\n=== By vehicle ===\\nDriving wise, Sekigahara is at the intersection between Routes 365 (N-S) and 21 (E-W). To the south of the town lies the E1 (Meishin) expressway that runs between [[Nagoya|Komaki]] (outside of Nagoya) and [[Nishinomiya]]. Both roads meander through narrow(ish) mountain valleys in the heart of rural Japan, and while they are in good condition (as of March 2023), they are quite far from the major tourist sites (about 1.5 hours from Kyoto and 45 minutes from Nagoya). Unless you are already staying in the [[Lake Biwa]] area or around [[Ogaki]], it's faster to buy a train ticket and take the trains.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nThere are no public buses that transport people into or through the town. The only buses that bring people in are Japanese tour coaches, so non-Japanese tourists will probably not utilize buses to visit the town at all (unless they have a really solid grasp of Japanese and have decided to book one of those tours).\\n\\n==Get around==\\n{{Mapframe|35.36641|136.46489|zoom=14}}\\n\\n=== By foot ===\\nUnless you drive in (or are bused in), everyone enters (and leaves) Sekigahara via the Sekigahara Station, which is in the center of the town. The entire town can be walked within a few hours, and it's probably well within reason to state that any part of the town is within a 20- to 30-minute walk from the Station. \\n\\nSome historic sites are located on the top of hills or small mountains. While everything is easily walked, some trails are stepped (thus bicycles are not allowed) and can be quite steep. \\n\\n=== By bicycle ===\\nBicycles can be rented at the Tourist Center opposite the Station entrance, or at the Memorial Museum to the north of the Station. Some of the more distant sites are best accessed by bicycle, but there are occasional parts of the trails where bicycles must be walked and not ridden (such as over some small dams). The bicycles use pedals that don't require snap-in shoes.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nThe town operated [http://www.town.sekigahara.gifu.jp/4588.htm Fureai Bus] rotates on 5 different routes, three times a day. It's not so convenient for the time-pressed traveler; you may tour by foot, bicycle, or private vehicle.\\n\\n==See==\\n{{infobox|Fireflies|Fireflies (\\u86cd ''hotaru'') can be spotted throughout the Japanese countryside in summer. Small insects less than a centimeter long, with light organs located near their rear, they are generally unafraid of humans and can easily be 'captured', after which they will obligingly walk about on your hand for a while before flying off. Both the male and female firefly glow, but the male has two light organs and is consequently clearly brighter, while the female has only one. According to folk tradition, fireflies represent the souls of the dead, but are generally viewed in a positive light as they are thought to have the power to ward off evil.}}\\n===Battle of Sekigahara Sites===\\n[[File:Sekigahara Historial and Folklore Museum 20140206.JPG|thumb|Sekigahara Town History and Folklore Museum]]\\nWhile the ''Battle of Sekigahara'' is of major significance to Japanese history buffs and school groups, foreign visitors are rare and information in English is generally minimal. A solid grasp of Japanese and/or a local guide will come in handy here. '''Memorial posts''' (\\u9663\\u8de1 ''jin-ato'') have been set up at most major battle sites in the area, but information is in Japanese. Historic markers are set up next to the posts, which explains in Japanese and English both the significance of said post and how the battle unfolded for the person that the post commemorates (for example, the post marking Shimadzu Yoshihiro's encampment details how his forces acted in the battle).\\n* {{see\\n| name=Gifu Sekigahara Battlefield Memorial Museum | alt=\\u5c90\\u961c\\u95a2\\u30b1\\u539f\\u53e4\\u6226\\u5834\\u8a18\\u5ff5\\u9928, Gifu Sekigahara Kosenj\\u014d Kinenkan | url=https://sekigahara.pref.gifu.lg.jp/ | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.365559 | long=136.466175 | directions=just north of the Station, about a 3- to 5-minute walk up a slight hill\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\u00a5500 for adults, \\u00a5400 for students, and \\u00a5300 for kids\\n| lastedit=2023-04-04\\n| content=This new museum (built 2020) offers a good introduction to the battle itself.

The upper floors contain mainly replicas (although some original artifacts and documents are displayed) of writings relating to the battle or Tokugawa's rise to power, and then goes in depth of the aftermath of the battle and the consolidation of his rule. Kids and the young at heart will enjoy the third floor, which offers a hands-on exhibit where you can play around with different types of weapons used during the battle (such as katanas, matchlock rifles, and battle fans). The fifth floor is an observation deck that gives a panorama of the battlefield and town, and has signs (in Japanese) that indicate where each important thing is/was.

Older folks will want to visit too, to see '''Meiji Shrine''' (''Meiji Jing\\u016b'') and '''Yoyogi Park'''.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nThe broad, tree-lined avenue leading downhill from the southern end of the JR station is '''Omote-sand\\u014d''' (\\u8868\\u53c2\\u9053), which leads to the upscale [[Tokyo/Aoyama|Aoyama]] district. The street is full of cafes and clothing stores. For teenagers, though, the place to be is '''Takeshita-dori''', which is a bustling narrow street several blocks to the north.\\n\\nNearby '''Yoyogi Park''' (\\u4ee3\\u3005\\u6728\\u516c\\u5712 ''Yoyogi-k\\u014den'') was the site of the first successful powered aircraft flight in Japan, on December 19, 1910, by Captain Yoshitoshi Tokugawa, following which it became an army parade ground. During the postwar occupation, it was the site of the Washington Heights residence for U.S. officers. It later was selected as the site for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and the distinctive Olympic buildings designed by Kenzo Tange are still nearby. In 1967, it was made into a city park.  Today, the park is a popular hangout, especially on Sundays, when it is used as a gathering place for people to play music, practice martial arts, etc. The park has a bike path, and bicycle rentals are available. As a consequence of Japan's long recession, there are several large, but surprisingly quiet and orderly, homeless camps around the park's periphery.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{mapframe|35.671|139.703|zoom=14}}\\n{{Mapmask|35.6689,139.6910|35.6678,139.6918|35.6682,139.6933|35.6684,139.6998|35.6693,139.7024|35.6645,139.7017|35.6638,139.7040|35.6613,139.7078|35.6630,139.7104|35.6642,139.7087|35.6652,139.7097|35.6658,139.7102|35.6670,139.7113|35.6672,139.7110|35.6698,139.7133|35.6705,139.7137|35.6719,139.7127|35.6733,139.7125|35.6757,139.7127|35.6746,139.7070|35.6777,139.7060|35.6795,139.7047|35.6805,139.7045|35.6800,139.7009|35.6810,139.6985|35.6809,139.6975|35.6801,139.6961|35.6797,139.6947|35.6773,139.6936|35.6742,139.6914|35.6697,139.6908|35.6689,139.6910}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q682894}} <!-- Tokyo Metro -->\\n{{Mapshapes|Q247782}} <!-- Toei Subway -->\\n{{Mapshape|title=Rinkai Line|wikidata=Q225095|type=geoline|stroke=#00b48d|stroke-width=4|stroke-opacity=1}}\\n{{Mapshape|title=Tokyo Monorail|wikidata=Q8015774|type=geoline|stroke=#ff0000|stroke-width=4|stroke-opacity=1}}\\n\\n===By train===\\n'''JR Harajuku Station''' on the Yamanote Line is the obvious way to get to Harajuku.

The subway is better than JR for getting here from central Tokyo, but the Yamanote Line is easier if you are coming from Tokyo Station. The nearby '''Omotesando''' Station (on the Ginza and Hanzomon subway lines) is further down Omote-sand\\u014d near the intersection with Aoyama-dori.

Each group stakes out its territory around '''Yoyogi Park''' (\\u4ee3\\u3005\\u6728\\u516c\\u5712 ''Yoyogi-k\\u014den''). Keep in mind that Harajuku is well known worldwide, so many tourists show up on Sundays. Best to be a bit early to avoid being stuck between big tourist groups.\\n\\n* The bridge across the train tracks sometimes has teenagers dressed up as '''Gothic Lolita''' and other extreme Japanese youth fashions. Besides just hanging out with friends, many come here to be snapped by the magazine photographers who mingle. Unfortunately, as of lately, the police seem to be cracking down on loitering, so they are becoming increasingly rare.\\n* Over by the entrance to the park, people with greased hair listen to '''rockabilly''' music and dance in their vintage jeans. This subculture has been around since the early 1980s.\\n* The sidewalks along the south side are usually occupied by '''junk vendors''' and loud '''rock bands'''. Both of these groups periodically get swept away by police crack-downs, though.\\n* The tree-lined area leading from the south end of the park to Shibuya is filled with all sorts of '''street performers''', mostly folk-pop singers, but also including hip-hop dancing and street theater.\\n\\n===Shrines===\\n[[File:MeijiShrine_Maiden.JPG|thumb|250px|Shrine maiden at Meiji Jingu, offering a bit of serenity among all the surrounding commerce]]\\n[[File:Meiji Shrine, Barrels of sake.jpg|thumb|Meiji Shrine, barrels of sake]]\\n\\n* {{see\\n| name=Meiji Shrine | alt=\\u660e\\u6cbb\\u795e\\u5bae ''Meiji Jing\\u016b'' | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.676111 | long=139.699167 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=Free\\n| content=Tokyo's grandest Shinto shrine, built in 1920 to commemorate the late Emperor Meiji, who oversaw Japan's rapid industrialization and rise to major world power status in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The city is west of Tokyo's 23 downtown wards, bordering on [[Kanagawa]]. Machida City has relatively more nature than any other city in Tokyo. The town has been the setting for many manga and video games.\\n[[File:Buaiso stone pavement.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Buaiso]]\\n==Understand==\\nIt is the third most populous city in Tokyo. Machida is a city with a city and nature. The area in front of Machida station is busy with department stores and shopping areas, but away from the station you will find quiet residential areas, greenery and parks. Minami-Machida has been redeveloped with commercial facilities and a park at [https://gbp.minamimachida-grandberrypark.com/ Grandberry Park] (\\u30b0\\u30e9\\u30f3\\u30d9\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30d1\\u30fc\\u30af). In front of Machida, you will find a variety of shops and brands, and almost everything you need is available. Once you've done the necessary shopping, you can relax in the park.\\n\\nSatoshi Tajiri, the creator of Pok\\u00e9mon, spent his childhood in this town, and Tajiri says that his experience of playing in the nature of Machida, where he was called \\\"Dr. Insect\\\", has been used in creating Pok\\u00e9mon. A Pok\\u00e9mon manhole has been set up in Serigaya Park near the house where Tajiri lived. It is also the town where the raccoon dog (Tanuki) moves to in the last scene of the Studio Ghibli movie Pom Poko.\\n\\n===History===\\nMachida has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The oldest stone tool found in Machida City is about 23,000 years old. Around 16,500-2,800 years ago (Jomon period), people built settlements. A reproduction of a house from those days stands in the Honmachida Ruins Park (\\u672c\\u753a\\u7530\\u907a\\u8de1\\u516c\\u5712).\\n\\nThe Kamakura-kaido road runs through the city. This road network connected [[Kamakura]], the capital of the 12th century, with various places. As a stopping point for the road, a post town was established in Machida and prospered. It is said that there was a castle built in those days, but it has been replaced by a temple and a park. The Ruins of Idesawa Castle and the Ruins of Idesawa Battlefield are the Sugawara Shrine (\\u83c5\\u539f\\u795e\\u793e).\\n\\nIt also became prosperous as a transit point for the \\\"Silk Road\\\" that brought silk produced in [[Hachioji]] to [[Yokohama]] in the late 17th century. There are many old establishments with a long history. Established in 1884, Kakishimaya (\\u67ff\\u5cf6\\u5c4b), which supported \\\"Silk Road\\\" from long ago as a horse broker. Established in 1895, Masaya Shoten (\\u67fe\\u5c4b\\u5546\\u5e97), Machida's oldest dry goods store. Established in 1919, Tomisawa Shoten (\\u5bcc\\u6fa4\\u5546\\u5e97), which mainly deals in confectionery materials. Established in 1787, Oka Naozaburo Store (\\u5ca1\\u76f4\\u4e09\\u90ce\\u5546\\u5e97), a soy sauce brewer and distributor.\\n\\nDuring the war of the 20th century, Machida was spared from the fires of war, and the post-war reconstruction of the city prospered quickly. The Machida Nakamise shopping street (\\u753a\\u7530\\u4ef2\\u898b\\u4e16\\u5546\\u5e97\\u8857), which evolved from the post-war black market, retains the atmosphere of the 20th century.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n*Average spring temperatures are highs of 15-25&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 4-17&nbsp;\\u00b0C. There is a rainy season around June, when spring turns to summer.\\n*Average summer temperatures are highs of 25-33&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 20-23&nbsp;\\u00b0C, which is 1 to 2 degrees cooler than in the center of Tokyo. It's hot and humid, but the wind feels cooler than in the city center because of the many green areas. Be careful of sudden showers in summer.\\n*Average autumn temperatures are highs of 17-22&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 7-15&nbsp;\\u00b0C. There is a rainy season around September, when autumn turns to winter.\\n*Average winter temperatures are highs of 10-15&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of minus 2-5&nbsp;\\u00b0C. It can snow enough to accumulate for a day or two.\\n\\n===Tourist information site===\\nThe local tourist association has a [https://machida-guide.or.jp/ multilingual guide site].\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By train===\\nMachida is a major stop on the ''Odakyu Line'' from [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]], and the ''JR Yokohama Line'' between [[Yokohama]] and [[Hachioji]].\\n\\nNearly all Odakyu trains out of Shinjuku stop at Machida. The fastest ways to reach Machida from Shinjuku are by the Odakyu Rapid Express (\\u5feb\\u901f\\u6025\\u884c, marked with orange text) and Express trains (\\u6025\\u884c, written in red text). These trains depart frequently, every 10 minutes or less, and reach Machida from Shinjuku in about 29 to 35 minutes (\\u00a5360). Slower Semi-Express (\\u6e96\\u6025) or local trains can take about 45 to 55 minutes. Machida is also the first stop on all Limited Express services that run to Hakone. They take about the same time as a Rapid Express, but incur an additional \\u00a5400 surcharge. However, for that price you get your own comfortable seat, similar to those on a bullet train, so reserving a seat on this train especially during rush hour can make your ride a lot more pleasant.\\n\\nJR Yokohama Line trains make runs to Machida from Hachioji (20\\u201330 minutes, \\u00a5290) and Yokohama (30\\u201340 minutes, \\u00a5380). More frequent trains from Yokohama depart from nearby Higashi-Kanagawa (\\u6771\\u795e\\u5948\\u5ddd) station.\\n\\nThe Yokohama Line offers the best connection from the Tokaido Shinkansen to Machida via Shin-Yokohama station (15\\u201320 minutes, \\u00a5290).\\n\\nThere is no charge for JR trains with the '''Japan Rail Pass'''.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nKanachu and Keio bus companies jointly offer daily services to Machida from Narita and Haneda airports. (There is only one service, depending on the time of the day, you may get Kanachu or Keio service.)\\n==Get around==\\n{{Mapframe|35.542478|139.452153|zoom=12|height=400|width=400|layer=W}}\\n===By train===\\nTrains run on the Odakyu Line, the JR Yokohama Line and the Tokyu Denentoshi Line. The Odakyu Line, Tokyu Denentoshi Line and Kei\\u014d Sagamihara Line run from northeast to southwest along Kanagawa Prefecture, and the JR Yokohama Line runs from southeast to northwest along Kanagawa Prefecture. Trains run along the border of the prefecture, so buses are the main way to get around in Machida. Trains run along the border between prefectures, so buses are the main way to get around inside Machida.\\n*Odakyuu Lune (\\u5c0f\\u7530\\u6025\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Machida Station | alt=\\u753a\\u7530\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.543628 | long=139.444812 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tamagawa Gakuen Station | alt=\\u7389\\u5ddd\\u5b66\\u5712\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.563372 | long=139.463395 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tsurukawa Station | alt=\\u9db4\\u5ddd\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.583197 | long=139.481687 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n*JR Yokohama Line (JR\\u6a2a\\u6d5c\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Naruse Station | alt=\\u6210\\u702c\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.535467 | long=139.472944 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Machida Station | alt=\\u753a\\u7530\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.542003 | long=139.445369 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Kobuchi Station | alt=\\u53e4\\u6df5\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.556009 | long=139.419202 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Fuchinobe Station | alt=\\u6df5\\u91ce\\u8fba\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.568745 | long=139.395119 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Yabe Station | alt=\\u77e2\\u90e8\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.573081 | long=139.386765 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Sagamihara Station | alt=\\u76f8\\u6a21\\u539f\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.581486 | long=139.370726 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Hashimoto Station | alt=\\u6a4b\\u672c\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.594943 | long=139.344972 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Aihara Station | alt=\\u76f8\\u539f\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.606898 | long=139.331665 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n*Tokyu Denentoshi Line (\\u6771\\u6025 \\u7530\\u5712\\u90fd\\u5e02\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Minami-Machida Granberry Park | alt=\\u5357\\u753a\\u7530\\u30b0\\u30e9\\u30f3\\u30d9\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30d1\\u30fc\\u30af\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.511468 | long=139.470655 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Suzukake Dai Station | alt=\\u3059\\u305a\\u304b\\u3051\\u53f0\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.516933 | long=139.481556 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tsukushino Station | alt=\\u3064\\u304f\\u3057\\u91ce\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.527689 | long=139.485080 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n*Kei\\u014d Sagamihara Line (\\u4eac\\u738b \\u76f8\\u6a21\\u539f\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tamasakai Station | alt=\\u591a\\u6469\\u5883\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.601895 | long=139.367303 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===By bus===\\nYou can get to Machida by bus.

The '''Southern Lights''' or '''''aurora australis''''' also occur but are not as often observed.\\n\\nTo observers at far-northern latitudes, the Lights are a frequent occurrence, but many who live in more temperate climates have never seen them, even though they are occasionally seen as far south as 35 degrees North latitude. This article will help you improve your chances of seeing the Lights if you journey north.\\n[[File:Aurora Borealis I.jpg|thumb|400px|Northern Lights near [[Troms\\u00f8]], [[Norway]]]]\\nThe aurorae are caused by charged particles ejected from the sun. When these particles reach the earth, they collide with gas molecules in the earth's upper atmosphere, energising them and creating a spectacular multi-coloured light show. Charged particles are affected by magnetic fields, so the Lights occur mainly at far northern or southern latitudes near the Earth's magnetic poles.\\n\\nThe Lights look somewhat similar to a sunset in the sky at night, but appear occasionally in arcs or spirals usually following the earth's magnetic field. They fairly often look like moving curtains of light, high in the sky. They are most often light green in color but often have a hint of pink. Strong eruptions also have violet and white colors. Red northern lights are rare, but are sometimes observed.\\n\\nThe Lights are generally fairly dim, but sometimes bright enough that reading a newspaper on a moonless night is possible. Both brightness and how far from the poles they are visible vary according to three factors: time of year, an 11-year cycle in solar activity, and solar storms. These are discussed in more detail later.\\n\\nLight pollution around cities can mask a dim aurora display. Therefore, areas at least 30 km from cities are preferred for viewing. The trick is to get far enough from cities for good viewing (generally easy, since most northern areas are not heavily populated) ''without'' taking undue risks in a climate that can easily kill you.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Map auroral oval mostly canada.png|thumb|200px|Northern Lights oval, 2007]]\\n\\nContrary to intuition, seeing the Northern Lights isn't just a matter of heading north. The Lights occur mainly in a circular or elliptical band centered on the earth's North ''Magnetic'' Pole, which is not at the same location as the [[North Pole | North ''Geographic'' Pole]].\\n\\nThe exact location of the North Magnetic Pole varies. Until early in this century, the pole was moving slowly (about 10 km/year) north across [[Ellesmere Island]] in the nearly uninhabited far north of [[Canada]]. Since the beginning  of the  21st century, the pole has been moving faster, for reasons scientists are not yet certain of. As of late 2019 it is out in the Arctic Ocean well north of Ellesmere, and moving toward Russia at about 55 km/year. Because of the movement, the advantages of being on the \\\"right side\\\" of the earth are becoming less pronounced, but there is still a slight North American bias in your chance of seeing the Lights.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|thumb|200px|Southern Lights seen from space]]\\n\\nAuroral displays aren't strongest ''at'' the pole; the band of greatest activity is offset from the Magnetic Pole by 20 degrees or so; the magnetic lines of force are curved and the curvature creates the offset. The '''Northern Lights oval''', meaning the area with the highest probability of seeing the Lights, covers most of [[Alaska]], northern parts of [[Canada]], the southern half of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], northern [[Norway]] and the northernmost areas of [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], as well as the western half of the Russian north. There is a similar oval in the South; see the photo.\\n\\nRegions such as the central and southern parts of the [[Nordic countries]], southern Canada, the north-central [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Scotland]] also frequently see Northern Lights, but not as often as directly under the Northern Lights oval. [[Svalbard]] sees Northern Lights less often than Northern Scandinavia, but is a place to observe the fainter Day Northern Lights visible during waking hours in its long [[polar night]]. \\n\\nThat said, the actual latitudes of the Lights vary considerably. In times of high solar activity (more on that later), the Lights may be seen in North America at latitudes as low as 35 degrees North, meaning that all but the southernmost parts of the United States may get a display. The offset of the Pole keeps solar storms from benefiting Europe quite as strongly, but most of the countries of northern Europe will get displays during periods of solar storms.\\n\\n==Planning==\\nThere is no guarantee of seeing the Northern Lights even if you are in the best areas at the best time, and there is some chance in others areas and seasons. However, a bit of planning will radically increase your chances. In short, pick somewhere on or very near the oval and go in winter.\\n\\n===Time of year===\\n[[File:AuroraBuryatia.jpg|thumb|400px|Lights in Scandinavia]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\nDarkness is required. Most Northern Lights locations are at high latitudes, in areas that get the \\\"[[midnight sun]]\\\"; there is no darkness from late April until mid-August, or even longer in far northern locations like [[Svalbard]]. Places within eight degrees of latitude south of the Arctic Circle, such as [[Yellowknife]] in Canada, experience \\\"white nights\\\", with only a few hours of twilight between dusk and dawn, at this time of year. In this period, no Northern Lights can be observed.\\n\\nIn the most intense Northern Lights areas, right on the oval, the lights are sometimes observed in any season but chances are best when it is dark after 6pm, from late September to late March. \\n\\nOn a yearly basis, the Lights are at their peak around the time of the equinoxes, in September and March.  The reasons for this trend aren't fully known, but it's definitely real, not just an artifact of the weather or other viewing conditions. Also, if you are planning to do other activities during the day, this is a good time to visit because you can enjoy twelve hours of daylight and still have a good chance of seeing the aurora at night. Temperatures are also milder than in mid-winter.\\n\\n===Time of day===\\nThe time between 6PM and 1AM is the most intense period of the day. The highest probability within this timespan is between 10 and 11PM. However, this is a guideline, and during the Polar night aurorae can be observed as early as 4PM, and all through the night. The most intense displays last some 5\\u201315 minutes each. In periods of strong activity, one can generally expect flares starting in the early evening, peaking around 10pm, and going on into the early morning hours.\\n\\nEven with good clothing, few travellers can tolerate a long time outdoors in an arctic night and the nights generally get continuously colder from sunset until the morning sun starts to warm things up. Even if there are lights in the early evening, it may be best to set out at 9pm or so (sun time, check your timezone); this gives you a good chance of catching the peak display without being out too long or at the coldest times.\\n\\n===11-year cycle===\\nIn the longer term, auroral displays are correlated with an 11-year cycle in sunspot activity and other perturbations of the sun; the more restless the sun, the more aurorae. However, at the most favorable latitudes, the Lights are still likely to be seen even at solar minimum; it's mainly at lower latitudes that they get scarce during the inactive times. There is a maximum in solar activity around 2024.\\n\\n===Solar storms===\\nIn addition to these more or less regular variations in frequency of the aurora, there are also less predictable, erratic displays resulting from '''solar storms'''.  Some of these, particularly near solar-activity maximum, can lead to visible Northern Lights remarkably far south, if you're in an area with clear, transparent night skies. The largest recorded solar storm took place in 1859; the Lights were bright enough to read a newspaper in [[Boston]] (42\\u00b0N) and visible as far south as Mexico. That storm was powerful enough that telegraphs would work without their normal power source, some caught fire. A similar one would probably destroy most electronics.\\n\\nThe [[#Alerts|Alerts]] section below will help you stay on top of solar activity and prepare for some viewing when a solar storm does occur.\\n\\n===Clear skies===\\nLast but not least, don't forget the '''weather forecast''' &mdash; aurora occur very high up in the atmosphere, and if there are clouds in the way you will not see anything. In Northern Scandinavia, the weather is notably better towards the end of the Northern Lights season (February-March), than in the beginning. The weather is probably the most important success factor in the areas under the Northern Lights oval, where there are visible Northern Lights on up to 80% of all clear nights.\\n\\n==Prepare==\\n\\n===Alerts===\\nIf you have the luxury of being able to travel into aurora-viewing territory on short notice, you can improve your chances of seeing something by being aware of \\\"space weather,\\\" the things going on beyond the earth's atmosphere as a result of solar activity.\\n[[File:Aurora australis ISS 20120715.jpg|thumb|400px|Southern Lights seen from the International Space Station, with the Canadarm robotic arm in the foreground]]\\nA good site for space weather information is operated by the (US) [http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] (NOAA). Measurements aboard the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite are used for plotting maps of current extent and position of the auroral oval around both poles; see their [https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast forecast] which predicts intensity and geographical location of the auroral oval based on current solar wind conditions and interplanetary magnetic field virtually in real time. The maps also show the observation limits of current aurorae. The commercial site [http://www.spaceweather.com/ Space Weather] presents much of the same information in digested, more accessible form.\\n\\nThe University of Alaska Fairbanks maintains an [http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast Aurora Alert] website. For Finland, the Finnish Meteorological Institute has an [http://aurorasnow.fmi.fi/public_service/ activity forecast] and current data about magnetic activity. The Icelandic MET office provides a [http://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/ lights forecast] for Iceland including cloud cover prediction.\\n\\nActivity is mainly predicted from the readings taken by the NASA Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellites, which give a one-hour warning. Solar wind activity is characterized by three principal figures: the north-south component of the magnetic field (Bz), speed and density. When Bz is negative (southward), solar wind particles are best able to enter the atmosphere and give rise to aurorae. At high velocities, auroral activity may occur despite a moderately negative Bz. In geomagnetic storms, Bz fluctuates rapidly. Overall geomagnetic activity is characterized by the planetary K-index (Kp), for which predictions are issued. A Kp of 5 or higher occurs in storms and generally makes auroral viewing possible well South of the oval in the northern parts of Europe and the [[United States of America|continental U.S.]]\\n\\nLonger-term estimates can be made by observation of the Sun for bursts. However, the physical models are poorly developed, partly because only two satellites, ACE and DSCOVR, observe the solar wind before it hits the Earth, and the predictions are rather unreliable. The approximate day can be predicted, but whether the burst hits the Earth face-on and exactly when and at what force remains unknown. \\\"Nowcasting\\\" on the ground is done by measuring magnetic field fluctuations, and there are webcams pointed at the sky for directly seeing the aurorae. The NASA Polar and Environmental Satellites (POES) directly measure the extent of the auroral oval, but the satellites pass the pole about 14 times a day and thus the picture can be couple of hours old.\\n\\nIf a major solar storm develops that is forecast to have a good chance of producing Northern (and Southern) Lights, your time to respond will be measured in hours to a few days, rather than either minutes or weeks. The particles that create the aurora move much more slowly than light, so a storm can be observed well before the particles it produces reach Earth, but the time difference is not enormous. The forecasts will usually include some indication of how far from the magnetic poles the activity is expected to extend.  For purposes of travel planning, it's a good idea to plan conservatively and go to a locale somewhat closer to the pole than the predicted maximum extent of the aurora; things don't always work out as forecast, and the Lights may be relatively weak and/or confined to the northern horizon if you're at the southern edge of the activity, either limitation possibly creating difficulties for you in viewing owing to light pollution.\\n\\n===Clothing===\\n[[File:St\\u00f8rmer and Birkeland Alta 1910.jpg|thumb|400px|Freezing photographers, Norway, 1910]]\\nBecause aurorae are usually visible at night in the colder months of the year, the observers tend to spend long hours in cold darkness. It is essential to  dress adequately to minimize the unpleasant side of the auroral experience, and almost impossible to dress too warmly.\\n\\nIn any area that gets severe winters, winter clothing will be widely available, but specialist shops catering to [[Skiing|skiers]], [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] or [[Wilderness backpacking|wilderness backpackers]] generally offer the best choice. Further south, these specialists may be the only places with winter equipment.\\n\\nIn remote northern locations where food, fuel and equipment have to be shipped in, ''prices on more-or-less everything can be very high''. Major northern cities tend to have better prices than more isolated areas, but still higher than in areas further south. Most travellers should buy much of their equipment before setting out; this gives more time for shopping, saves money, and avoids arriving in summer clothing when it is seriously cold outside.\\n\\nSome travellers should plan an extra stop for shopping; for example, going from Miami (where good winter gear is likely to be hard to find) to view the Lights in [[Churchill]] (where it is likely to be expensive and selection limited), one might stop in [[Chicago]], [[Toronto]] or [[Winnipeg]] to outfit oneself.\\n\\nFor specific information on winter clothing, see [[Cold weather#Clothing|Cold weather]]. Remember that you will have to use your fingers, so a combination of gloves and mittens can be useful.\\n\\n===Photography===\\n\\nTaking good pictures of the Northern Lights is '''very difficult''', since they're fast-moving, often faint and against a pitch-dark background, all of which befuddles consumer point-and-shoot cameras. Almost any [[Travel photography/Full systems|interchangeable lens camera]] can handle the job, given the right lens, but the typical \\\"kit lens\\\" sold with them will almost certainly not be fast enough and may not be wide enough either.\\n{{infobox|Lens focal lengths|In discussing focal length, we assume a 35mm film camera or \\\"full frame\\\" digital camera. For other types of camera, the actual numbers are different but the \\\"35mm equivalent\\\" is often quoted.}}\\nLong exposures are often required to capture faint lights. Here's what you need for a sporting chance:\\n\\n* A camera that supports '''manual exposure''' (5 to 40 seconds)\\n* A '''fast lens''' (aperture f/2.8 or better). Typically, a [[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|wide-angle lens]] is used to get a large area of sky.\\n* '''Fast film''' (800 ASA or better), or equivalent ISO setting on a digital camera\\n* A '''tripod''' to hold the long exposure\\n* '''Cable release or self-timer''' to trigger shots without stirring the camera\\n: Even better, for some cameras a '''remote control''' is available. Some cameras can use a wireless '''smartphone connection''' as remote control, but few smartphones are made for the conditions.\\n* '''Manual focus'''. It is not recommended to just focus your lens to infinity, instead it is best done by aiming at the Moon or a bright star (ideally in the live-view mode and using the maximum zoom).\\n* Multiple '''spare batteries and memory cards''': only having them will ensure they won't be needed. Keep the spares warm.\\n* What you don't need is the lens '''filter''': it can cause interference, so better take it off your lens.\\n[[File:Aurora shapes.jpg|thumb|405x405px|Images with Canon EOS 400D, ISO 1600, f/2.8, exposure 4s\\u201330s, 17mm (24 full frame).]]\\nWith a digital camera shooting in RAW format (or at least JPG + RAW) is a good idea: if something goes wrong in the field, there is more space for corrections in post-processing that way.\\n\\nAvoid breathing on the lens, the viewer or the display to prevent frosting them up. A light source such as a flashlight or headlamp can be useful when setting up the camera and tripod, and a smartphone is handy for alerts and forecasts. However, you need to get your eyes adjusted to darkness, so it is a good idea to limit use of these and set both phone and camera LCD displays to minimum brightness.\\n\\nThe ideal location has no light pollution, offers some shelter against wind, and is easily accessible. On a cold arctic night, you definitely want to avoid lugging camera and tripod a long distance or standing around in windy conditions waiting for the right shot. Moreover, wind tends to shake the camera, which is a problem in long exposures. A bigger, sturdier tripod helps with that, but is even worse to lug around.  If possible, do some scouting by day so you can go straight to a good location at night. It is not always possible to find a great location, but even a reasonable one can give better photos with less discomfort.\\n\\nAlso, try to get something interesting in the foreground; the [[#Europe|Norwegian photo below]] is a fine example. A shot of just the sky and some snow can be a bit boring even if the Lights are good.\\n\\nEither a zoom (variable focal length) or a prime (single focal length) lens can be used; each type has advantages. Zoom lenses are more flexible; you can adjust quickly for different sizes of light display. Primes are generally significantly faster than zooms, lighter and more compact; in many cases they also give a sharper picture than a zoom lens set to the same focal length.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora borealis over Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska.jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora borealis in [[Alaska]]]]<!-- image referenced in the text, check if you move or exchange it -->\\n\\n[[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|Wide-angle lenses]] are the commonest choice for photographing the lights. They give some distortion, even producing \\\"fish-eye\\\" images in extreme cases. The photo to the right was taken with a 16mm lens; the horizon appears curved and the trees in the foreground appear slightly off vertical, but some viewers would not notice this distortion and few would find it bothersome. The [[#Time_of_year|Scandinavian photo above]] used an even wider lens and has more distortion. A slightly longer lens, perhaps 24mm, would reduce the distortion but cover less of the sky. This is where zoom lenses have a significant advantage over primes; with, say, a 16\\u201335mm zoom you can adjust each shot to get the best trade-off between distortion and coverage. In other conditions, you might carry several primes and adjust by swapping lenses, but this is remarkably inconvenient in the field in an arctic night.\\n\\nA faster lens or a high-ISO camera setting can reduce exposure time, which is good. The photo to the right used an F2.8 lens and 25-second exposure. With F4, it would need 50 seconds, at or perhaps beyond the upper limit for practical shooting. An F1.4 lens would cut the time to around six seconds. This is quite likely to give a sharper photo because the lights move less during exposure, and it allows a bit more control over the shot; if you hit the shutter release when the sky looks particularly interesting, it is more likely to stay that way for a few seconds than over a longer time. This is where prime lenses have an advantage; they are often quite a bit faster than zooms. \\n\\nCombine a fast lens with a camera that allows high ISO settings and you might get exposure time down under a second, but it is not certain that this would give a better photo. High ISO settings give more noise in the image and you might lose more from that than you gain from the shorter time.\\n\\nFast wide lenses are expensive. Checking full-frame Canon lenses on an American vendor's site mid-2013, the cheapest lenses that might be suitable for shooting the Lights are a 40mm F2.8 at about $150 or 35/2.0 near $300; those are not wide enough to be ideal, but they would be usable and anything better is more expensive. More typical choices &mdash; for someone with a nice lens collection in hand or a good budget for building one &mdash; would be 20 or 24mm F2.8, 28/1.8, or the 17\\u201340 F4 zoom, in the $450 to $750 price range. The ideal choice might be either a 24/1.4 prime or 16\\u201335 F2.8 zoom, but these are high-end products mainly for professional photographers; either is around $1500. An ultra-wide 14mm F2.8 is a very good choice, and while those with auto-focus cost over $2000, some manual focus versions are available for a significantly lower price. Other brands have a different set of products and prices, but the overall pattern is similar. Companies other than the camera manufacturers also offer lenses, but again the pattern is similar.\\n\\nSee [[travel photography]] for more general discussion.\\n\\n==Locations==\\n[[File:Rovaniemi - Aurora Borealis.jpg|thumb|Aurora in [[Rovaniemi]], [[Finland]]]]\\nNorthern Lights usually form about 100 km (60 miles) above the surface of the earth. In principle, all areas under the Northern Lights oval are good observation points. However, most of these areas are remote and inaccessible, and suffer harsh climatic conditions.\\n\\nWhen selecting an observation site:\\n* If using a car, stay close to it. A typical car heater cannot actually keep a large metal vehicle warm when it is well below zero outside, but it is better than nothing and a car does provide shelter against wind. In really cold weather, leave the engine running even when you are away from the car, since the engine may have trouble starting again.\\n* Try finding accommodation in an area known to be good for viewing the Northern Lights. This may include a cottage, wilderness hut, a heated tent or similar shelter. This avoids long drives late at night to get to and from the viewing area.\\n* Avoid locations with light pollution; try to get away from populated areas. If this is not possible, try to have at least the northern view free of light pollution.\\n* Avoid steep hillsides or other major obstacles to the north.\\n\\nConsider bringing a tent or just a portable windbreak to provide some shelter from wind. Also vacuum flasks for hot beverages.\\n\\nViewing or photographing the Lights is an activity where hiring a local guide or paying for a tour is often worthwhile. A guide's local knowledge can help in several areas: coping with the weather, finding good sites, choosing good routes, and avoiding close encounters with [[dangerous wildlife]] such as polar bears or musk oxen. Also, a guide or tour company will have vehicles and other equipment suitable for the conditions. In remote areas it may not be possible to rent a vehicle or bring your own and, even if it is possible, it is not advisable unless both vehicle and driver are well prepared for [[winter driving]]. Some tours offer unusual transport options such as snowmobiles or sleds pulled by dogs, reindeer or horses; few tourists could safely drive those, and no owner of valuable animals is likely to allow a visitor to handle them unsupervised.\\n\\nVarious locations provide some kind of infrastructure, like tours, observation points etc. Here are lists of some major ones, in approximately west-to-east order:\\n\\n===North America===\\n{{seealso|Winter in North America}}\\n[[File:Flickr - DVIDSHUB - Alaska Aurora Borealis (Image 1 of 2).jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora in [[Alaska]]]]\\n*[[Fairbanks]], Alaska: famous for aurora viewing, with many tours and sites that cater to aurora watchers.\\n*[[Yellowknife]], in Canada's Northwest Territories, also with many tours\\n*[[Churchill]], on Hudson's Bay in Manitoba, is right smack dab in the center of the auroral belt, and offers the opportunity to see (lots of) polar bears on the same trip.\\n*[[Isle Royale National Park]], Upper Michigan, is a leave-no-trace park with no tours and few facilities. This is the best place in the 48 contiguous US sates to see the lights because it is quite far north and there is no light pollution.\\n\\n===North Atlantic islands===\\n\\n*[[Kangerlussuaq]], Greenland: very high chance of seeing the Lights from November to March. If dogsled or snowmobile rides are desired, mid-late winter is recommended.\\n*[[M\\u00fdvatn]], Iceland: offers the unique experience of observing aurorae while soaking in a natural geothermal bath. The capital, [[Reykjavik]], serves as a base for many tours.\\n*[[Berneray]], Outer Hebrides: this remote Scottish island offers suitable conditions for northern lights observation due to low light pollution.\\n\\n===Europe===\\n[[File:Aurora over Haja-3,2.jpg|thumb|Near Troms\\u00f8\\u200e, Norway]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\n{{Seealso|Winter in the Nordic countries}}\\n\\n* [[Abisko]], Northern Sweden. A popular place where the northern lights can be watched from the Aurora Sky Station at the top of the mountain Nuolja.\\n* [[Troms\\u00f8]], Northern Norway, is an easily accessible location with mild weather and numerous excursions. However the coastal location makes it susceptible to overcast conditions. Nearby [[Skibotn]] enjoys a dryer climate (very dry for Norway); this makes for better viewing opportunities. Another nearby location is [[Senja]] island.\\n* [[Alta]], also in Norway but further to the north-east and known for prehistoric rock carvings, is marketed also as a place to watch northern lights.\\n* [[Jukkasj\\u00e4rvi]], Northern Sweden, is the site of the original Ice Hotel, with excellent viewing infrastructure.\\n* [[Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi]], [[Inari]] and [[Utsjoki]] in Finnish Lapland all have quite dry weather and little light pollution.<!-- Nellim is another village which is far from light pollution. Add when there is an article.--> The ski resorts [[Saariselk\\u00e4]] in Inari and [[Levi]] in Kittil\\u00e4 have accommodation in glass igloos specially designed for enjoying the northern lights.\\n* The Kola Peninsula of [[Murmansk Oblast]] is Russia's most popular viewing spot.\\n\\nThe likelihood of seeing aurorae rapidly decreases when going south. In [[Helsinki]], aurorae occur about once a month, and are usually masked by light pollution or clouds. Aurorae seen further outside of the auroral belts may also be much less vivid, with fewer colours.\\n\\n=== Cruise ships ===\\nA luxurious way to see the lights is to take a [[cruise ship]] along the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Alaska]], or toward [[Antarctica]] for the Southern Lights, in the appropriate season. Cruises tend to be expensive, but the costs may be quite reasonable compared to flying to a good site on land and paying for accommodation and tours there. Viewing the Lights by just strolling on deck after dinner is much more convenient than being driven somewhere to stand in the snow, and the chance of encounters with dangerous wildlife is lower. \\n\\nThere may be problems with this; not all cruise lines run in winter and it is ''extremely'' difficult to get good photos from a moving ship when the subject requires long exposures, as the lights generally do. If the cruise is not specially for aurora viewing, chances are that light pollution from the ship itself is an issue.\\n\\n=== In flight ===\\nMany travelers in the northern latitudes find themselves treated to an aerial view of the lights. It's probably not realistic to ''plan'' to see them while on a plane, but if you find yourself taking frequent flights in upper latitudes, consider opting for a window seat on the northern side of the plane. If the show is good enough, the captain will usually make an announcement.\\n\\nIf you thought cruises on the seas were expensive, you probably won't be interested in heading up into '''[[space]]''', but orbital flight at around $35 million/person is a pretty surefire way to see the lights, both Northern and Southern, with zero light interference, and quite a grand view!\\n\\n== The ''Southern'' Lights ==\\n[[File:Aurora Australis Over the Tasman Sea from SouthWest National Park.jpg|thumb|Aurora Australis as seen at the remote New Harbour Beach in Tasmania's Southwest National Park]]\\nAurorae happen in an oval about the South Magnetic Pole just as they do about the North one, and the South Magnetic Pole is similarly offset from the geographic [[South Pole]]. Would-be observers of the '''Southern Lights''' or '''''Aurora Australis''''' benefit from the happy accident that the offset of the South Magnetic Pole is generally in the direction of [[Australia]], although the Pole itself is still in [[Antarctica]] like the geographic one. The southern parts of Australia and [[New Zealand]] get more than their share of Lights relative to their latitude.\\n\\nIn particular, [[Tasmania]] and the [[South Island]] of New Zealand are places where the Lights can be observed several times a year. If conditions are right, [[Hobart]] and [[Invercargill]] offer the best chance in places that are quickly accessible from within Australia and New Zealand.  Although [[Christchurch]] has a geographic latitude south of [[Hobart]], its \\\"geomagnetic latitude\\\" is further north, and aurora there are no more likely than southern [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. Check the space weather while you are travelling.\\n[[File:AuroraAustralisDisplay.jpg|thumb|Southern Lights seen from [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]]]\\n\\nAll these locations are still outside the auroral belt itself, so the odds of catching the lights during your trip there are not good. Because of the skew towards the Eastern Hemisphere, it is not reasonable to expect any viewing from [[Patagonia]], and it's not that likely you'll see them even from the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The best place to view them would be Antarctica's [[Ross Sea]] via [[Macquarie Island]] (Australia) or the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]]. The best viewing would be from the boat itself. The closest island to the auroral belt that has a good range of tourist accommodation is [[Stewart Island]]. \\n\\nThere is day trip flight from [[Sydney]] to see the Southern Lights (A$1,295+).\\n\\nAll of the considerations about maximizing your chances of seeing the Northern Lights apply equally to seeing the Southern Lights, except that the Southern Hemisphere seasons should be taken into account in regards to maximizing the hours of darkness.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Astronomy]]\\n* [[Midnight sun]] \\u2014 at latitudes where there's dark all day in the winter and people travel to see the Northern Lights, there's usually light all night in the summer.\\n{{PartOfTopic|Natural attractions|the Arctic}}\\n{{guidetopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner | Skibotn banner aquaculture.jpg|caption=A view to Storfjorden and mountains around from a quay at Skibotn}}\\n[[Image:Skibotn view towards Roykeneset.JPG|thumb|300px|View towards R\\u00f8ykeneset isthmus]]\\n'''Skibotn''' (Northern Sami: ''Ivgubahta'', Kven/Finnish: ''Markkina'' or ''Yyke\\u00e4nper\\u00e4'') is a village in [[Troms]].

There are literally millions of lakes across the subarctic.\\n\\nSoils are generally poor and the growing season is short, so agriculture is limited but does thrive in small belts.

This episode is known as the '''Lapland War''' (Finnish: ''Lapin sota'', S\\u00e1mi: ''Lappi soahti''). The war lasted only from September 1944 to April 1945 but by the time they were done, some 100,000 people had fled, 675 bridges were blown up, all major roads were mined, and the capital Rovaniemi had only 13 houses left standing. However, it might be useful to understand that before this sad episode, locals and the German troops had a rather deep friendship from which the tourist can still find exciting relics.\\n\\nBut then, people don't come to Lapland for the architecture, they come here for the nature (and Santa).  While there are no craggy mountains or fjords here, the endless pine forests (in the very north: fell birch) and the treeless rounded fells (Finnish: ''tunturi'', S\\u00e1mi: ''duottar'', ''v\\u00e1rri'', ''oaivi'', ''\\u010dearru'', etc.) poking out between them can also be breathtakingly beautiful. Finns talk about the \\\"'''Lapland fever'''\\\" because of so many who have lost their heart to this land.\\n\\n===When to go===\\n[[File:Hiking in the winter time.jpg|thumb|Winter in [[Riisitunturi National Park]], [[Posio]]]]\\n\\nChristmas in Lapland sounds appealing, but this is the time of the [[polar night]]; it is dark and it can be very cold (\\u221230\\u00b0C/\\u221225\\u00b0F is common, records are around \\u221250\\u00b0C/\\u221260\\u00b0F). There are businesses happy to arrange meetings with '''Joulupukki''' (Santa Claus) in Rovaniemi and at some other destinations, and snowmobile or husky safaris. With some luck these are arranged in the light of '''[[northern lights|aurora borealis]]''' (Finnish: ''revontulet'', S\\u00e1mi: ''guovssahasat'') visible quite anywhere at these latitudes. Such organised trips are safe, but independent backcountry adventures require adequate skill and experience. If you happen to be in Lapland the first day the sun is seen again in the north, check whether there is a local celebration you could join.\\n\\nBy the end of February both the weather and the light improve, with temperatures on the better side of {{C|-10}} and nearly 12 hours of light a day, although the sun is low and it still feels like perpetual dusk. Most Finns only start to pack in at Easter, when it often is possible to ski in bright sunshine wearing only a T-shirt. It takes quite some time for the accumulated snow (often more than a metre) to melt off, and skiing may be possible as late as May.\\n\\nIn late spring and early summer, the landscape turns muddy as the snow melts, bringing on the curse of the Lapish '''[[Pests#Mosquitoes|mosquito]]''' and its friends (collectively known as ''r\\u00e4kk\\u00e4''), and if you think this sounds like a trivial nuisance you have never had to face up to the hordes that inhabit Lapland \\u2013 do not venture out without industrial-strength insect repellent. Mosquitoes are far less present in the centres of the cities (and above the tree line, especially in sunny weather with some wind) but it is virtually impossible to avoid the bite. The mosquitoes' bites are itchy and their noise is irritating, but they spread no diseases. There is a week or two between the spring floods and the r\\u00e4kk\\u00e4 season, when water levels are manageable and mosquitoes still few, around the end of May and early June. Get advice on local conditions if heading out for the wilderness, as routes and footwear may have to be chosen with some care. During the spring flood, wilderness hikes are only for those truly prepared, as every brook and wadi may have transformed into a river of icy water, partly still covered with snow.\\n\\nSummer temperatures are usually in the 10\\u201320\\u00b0C (50\\u201370\\u00b0F) range, but both freezing nights and +30\\u00b0C (90\\u00b0F) days are possible. July is the warmest month.\\n\\nOn the upside, the famous '''[[midnight sun]]''' is visible in Midsummer in large parts of Lapland (Rovaniemi is at the Arctic Circle, but it can be seen also a tad southward from there) \\u2013 and middle May through July in Utsjoki. Special events are held to celebrate the equinox and the midnight sun. Many foreigners have difficulty sleeping during these nightless periods, though a simple sleep mask should go a long way.\\n\\nBy late July the mosquitoes start to vanish and they're usually gone by late August. Hiking in the middle of ''ruska'' (S\\u00e1mi: ''ru\\u0161ki''), the colourful time of autumn, is a worthwhile experience. Towards the end of September, you are increasingly likely to get some snowfall, although the first snow usually comes in October.\\n\\nWhile ski resorts usually open in November, a reliable natural deep snow cover usually comes quite a bit later; for skiing in the backcountry, you may need to wait until after Christmas or choose routes where the snow cover is sufficient.\\n\\n==Talk==\\n[[File:Perisoreus Infaustus Kittila 2007 03 10c.JPG|thumb|upright|The Siberian Jay will often appear, to curiously watch the visitors.]]\\n\\nThe local language is mostly '''[[Finnish phrasebook|Finnish]]'''. The spoken dialects belong to the Per\\u00e4pohjola (far-north) subgroup of Finnish western dialects and have certain archaic features that often culminate in the characteristic use of the h-sound. You may encounter some humour based on this. The highly distinctive Torne river valley dialect is known as ''me\\u00e4nkieli'' (\\\"Our Language\\\") and has an official minority language status in Sweden. \\n\\nThree '''S\\u00e1mi languages''' \\u2013 [[Northern S\\u00e1mi phrasebook|Northern Sami]], Inari Sami, and Skolt Sami \\u2013 are spoken sparsely to commonly in the northernmost areas. The S\\u00e1mi languages \\u200b\\u200bhave an official status in the region designated as the ''S\\u00e1mi homeland''. Swedish (though official in Finland) is rarely spoken in this area (as adjacent regions in Sweden have traditionally been Finnish speaking), but the closely related [[Norwegian phrasebook|Norwegian]] is often heard in the border region, thanks to the lively shopping Norwegians. \\n\\nAs everywhere in Finland, you will survive very well with English, and it is the main option for those who don't speak Finnish. German and other languages up to Chinese or Japanese might be known at hotels and tourist attractions. Thanks to extensive international tourism, tourist materials are usually available in a wide variety of languages!\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[File:Christmas train at Kemi.JPG|thumb|Train in Kemi, with [[Sleeper trains|sleepers]], restaurant car, ordinary coaches and car-carrying cars \\u2013 and Father Christmas on board]]\\n\\n===By plane===\\nFlying is the fastest means of reaching much of Lapland, but for most destinations services are sparse and prices often steep. There are commercial airports in [[Hetta]] (\\\"[[Enonteki\\u00f6]]\\\"), [[Ivalo]], [[Kemi]], [[Kittil\\u00e4]] and [[Rovaniemi]]. Best options for airlines are Finnair and Norwegian. Air Baltic flies to Rovaniemi and Kittil\\u00e4 from [[Riga]]. The coaches mostly drive via the airports. In addition to the regular flights, mostly from Helsinki, there are seasonal flights and charter flights from abroad in season.\\n\\n===By train===\\nMost of Lapland is reachable only by bus or car, but even when there is no train service to your destination, using [https://www.vr.fi/en the train] for the first leg often makes sense. For some destinations you can buy a combined train/coach-ticket, also otherwise the transfer is usually smooth.\\n\\nTrains will get you to the towns, most notably to the provincial capital [[Rovaniemi]] at the Arctic Circle, or to the northernmost railway station in [[Kolari]]. The overnight trains from the south have [[Sleeper trains|sleepers]] and [https://www.vr.fi/en/carcarrier some also take cars]. There are two kinds of sleeper trains: the old \\\"blue\\\" ''pikajuna'', mostly used as a complement in peak season, and the modern two-storey ones. The old ones have 3-person cabins and no showers, the new ones 2-person cabins, some of which can be combined for a family, and shared or en-suite showers. There is a cabin for a wheelchair user and an accompanying person in each modern sleeper, and one for those travelling with a pet. You always get the cabin for yourselves, so filling it up saves in price. The price for a journey from the south to Rovaniemi or Kemij\\u00e4rvi for two people in a sleeper cabin is about \\u20ac150\\u2013300.\\n\\nIf entering from [[Sweden]], there is a gap in the passenger train network before the border at [[Haparanda]]/[[Tornio]], but the connecting bus from [[Lule\\u00e5]] is free with [[Inter Rail]] and [[Scanrail]]. There are again trains from Lule\\u00e5 to Haparanda (terminating some 3.5 km from the Finnish train station in Tornio).\\n\\nFrom [[Russia]], you used to be able to take the train to [[Murmansk]] and continue by bus to [[Ivalo]] or get off at [[Kandalaksha]] and continue by bus to Rovaniemi. However, the border has been closed since 2023.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nThere are coach connections from [[Helsinki]] to Rovaniemi (15 hours), which is the hub of most connections. Northern [[Norway]] ([[Troms]] and [[Finnmark]]) has daily connections at least in summer. From Sweden, you will probably come via [[Haparanda]]/[[Tornio]], with other options making sense for certain destinations. From [[Russia]], there used to be bus connections from [[Murmansk]] to Ivalo thrice and from [[Kandalaksha]] to Rovaniemi twice a week, but the border is closed since 2023.\\n\\n[https://www.matkahuolto.fi/en Matkahuolto] has timetables for most connections, although you may have to try with different place names.\\n\\n===By car===\\nThere are good roads to Lapland, but instead of using a day on driving, you might want to get your car on an overnight train and wake up fresh in the morning to enjoy the landscape while driving only the remaining distance \\u2013 which may certainly be long enough. But you might want to use a few days to see the length of Finland on the [[Highway 4 (Finland)|E75]] (national road 4), or the west coast on [[E8 through Finland and Norway|E8]] (national road 8). The two roads share tarmac on the leg between Oulu and Kemi.\\n\\nCars can be loaded on trains in Turku, Helsinki/Pasila and Tampere and unloaded in Oulu, Rovaniemi, Kemij\\u00e4rvi and Kolari \\u2013 but not all combinations of departure and arrival station are possible, and not all the trains take cars. There are also restrictions on car size (including any add-ons), which may differ between trains. Possible dimensions are height of 1.65/1.84/2.04/2.30/{{nowrap|2.60 m,}} length of {{nowrap|5/10/15 m}} and width of {{nowrap|2.20 m.}} A car slot costs about \\u20ac150. Cars are loaded on the trains in advance, so you are likely going to spend an hour or two in town after having loaded them (but you might be able to get to your cabin early). People who cannot drive aboard themselves, e.g. a single parent with small children, can get this as a service, to be requested in advance.\\n\\nIf you drive from southern Finland, these routes can be recommended:\\n* To Kemi, Rovaniemi, Kemij\\u00e4rvi, Sodankyl\\u00e4, Ivalo, Inari, Utjoki: E75 or E8 to Kemi, then E75\\n* To Kolari, Muonio, Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi: E75/E8 to Kemi, then E8 through Tornio\\n* To Kittil\\u00e4, Levi: E75, 79 through Rovaniemi\\n** Alternatively through Kajaani, using road 5 instead of road 4 (E75). This route is more rural and has less traffic.\\n\\nIf you drive through Sweden, these routes can be recommended:\\n* To Tornio, Kemi: [[E4 through Sweden|E4]] to Tornio, continue to Kemi along E8\\n* To Rovaniemi, Kemij\\u00e4rvi, Sodankyl\\u00e4, Ivalo: E4 to Tornio, a short leg south along E8, then E75\\n* To Kolari, Kittil\\u00e4, Levi: [[E10 through Sweden and Norway|E10]], 392, 403 etc. through [[Pajala]]\\n* To Inari, Utsjoki or Kirkenes (Norway): E4 to Tornio, E8, then E75 through Ivalo\\n** Alternatively through Kolari and route 955, which is 70 km shorter and slightly faster, but the road is of less good quality, more adventurous.\\n\\n=== By bicycle ===\\nFour [[EuroVelo cycling routes]] reach the region (mostly under development as of 2023):\\n* EV 7 (Middle Europe Route): [[Malta]] to [[Nordkapp]] along the Swedish coast and via [[G\\u00e4llivare]], Karesuvanto and Hetta.\\n* EV 10 (Baltic Sea Route/Hansa circuit): around the Baltic Sea by the coast via Kemi and Tornio.\\n* EV 11 (East European Route): [[Athens]] to Nordkapp) via Helsinki, Kajaani, Oulu, Kemi, Rovaniemi and Karigasniemi\\n* EV 13 (Iron Curtain Trail): [[Rezovo]] to Grense Jakobselv via [[Kuusamo]], Salla, Sodankyl\\u00e4, Inari, N\\u00e4\\u00e4t\\u00e4m\\u00f6 and [[Kirkenes]]\\n\\nThere are not too many cycleways in sparsely inhabited areas like this, but there isn't too much traffic either on most roads. Check route descriptions. You also have to be prepared for the long distances and the climate \\u2013 although [[Oulu]] is one of the Finnish towns with most cyclists.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n[[File:Yhdystie 9695.jpg|thumb|Typical road in northern Lapland. Connecting road 9695 in [[Sodankyl\\u00e4]].]]\\n\\nDistances in Finnish Lapland are great and train service extends only to [[Kemij\\u00e4rvi]] (80 km northeast [[Rovaniemi]]) and [[Kolari]], so the independent traveler will thus have to rely on slightly cheaper but infrequent buses to get around. There is little competition in public transport in Lapland and indeed the voyage from Helsinki to Rovaniemi is easily cheaper than the voyage from Rovaniemi onwards!\\n\\n===By bus===\\nLong distance '''coaches''' or '''minibuses''' cover most of even the smallest places, often with sparse schedules (typically one or a few services a day along the main roads). They are the cheapest and slowest means of transportation. Although there are bus stops of course, they can also be stopped by hand sign when you happen to meet one as a hiker on a lonely countryside road. Express coaches usually turn into regular ones somewhere north of Rovaniemi. [http://www.matkahuolto.fi Matkahuolto] has timetables for most of these. For some destinations you should look for school buses, postal carriers or shuttle taxis.\\n\\nThe main companies for northern Lapland are ''[https://www.eskelisen.fi/en Eskelisen Lapinlinjat]'' and ''[https://www.koivistonauto.fi Koiviston auto]''. For smaller places, check also municipal pages (or the destinations guides). ''[http://www.onnibus.com Onnibus]'' offers cheaper bus service by a few intercity routes and has cooperation on some other legs (\\\"''Onniflex''\\\", meaning you find the services also through the Onnibus site, usually with the same price as through Matkahuolto). Generally coach prices are stable; low-cost offers are not something to expect. This also means that you don't have to buy tickets on the net \\u2013 paying to the driver will usually be at the same price. However, a few connections need to be ordered in advance, as you might be the only passenger.\\n\\nIf you are waiting for a coach at the bus stop, note that the vehicle on the scheduled route '''may not actually be a bus''', but a smaller car like a taxi. A coach ticket will still apply.\\n\\n===By train===\\nThe long-distance trains are usable on two routes: from Oulu to Kemi and farther north-east to Tervola, Rovaniemi and Kemij\\u00e4rvi, or northwards via Tornio, Ylitornio and Pello all the way up to Kolari.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\nTaxis are not necessarily connected to any call centres. Ask locally for phone numbers of individual taxi businesses. You don't want to have a taxi drive 100 km to fetch you, if that can be avoided; the fetching distance may show in the price (or you might want to tip generously). Often there is just one or two family businesses serving an area, other taxis may have to drive a long way.\\n\\nIf you use any local businesses, you could ask them about transport. They probably know all taxi drivers, might know the quirks of local public transport, and might be willing to offer a ride themselves.\\n\\n* Smartphone apps (don't expect them to be usable or sensible everywhere): Valopilkku, 02 Taksi, Menev\\u00e4, Taxi Booker (iTaksi), Taksi Helsinki\\n\\n===By car===\\n[[Image:Reindeers in Lapland.jpg|thumb|Reindeer crossing a highway in Lapland; wait for all of the herd to pass.]]\\n\\n{{seealso|Driving in Finland}}\\n\\nYou can reach most places in Lapland by car (yes, there are still villages without road connection!), but traffic even on main roads is sparse and distances are great. Minor roads are sometimes truly minor, even the longest ones. By selecting the shortest route shown on the map, you may not get the fastest route. The roads are at least in moderate condition though \\u2013 in summer. The northernmost motorway in the world is between Kemi and Tornio, the other highways are undivided two-lane roads, some minor roads are narrow enough that there are signposted meeting places.\\n\\nBring emergency supplies in case of a collision or breakdown, especially in winter. Locals will help if they can, but you may be in for a long, very cold wait.\\n\\nIf you want to make a one-way hike, some businesses may offer to drive your car to the destination.\\n\\nIf you are going to rent your car, check availability and prices beforehand. In Rovaniemi and Kittil\\u00e4 there are probably enough businesses, but in the far north you may have to take what is offered, and call to have anything offered.\\n\\n====Roadkill====\\nStay very alert, particularly at dawn and dusk, for wild animals. '''Reindeer''' are a common cause of accidents, while collisions with much larger '''elk''' (moose) are rarer but very often lethal. If you hit an animal, you must always inform the locals (or 112), even if the animal seems to be unharmed, as they will in turn inform the owner of the reindeer, or local hunters. Mark the place so that it can be found. You won't be charged with anything unless you were drunk or speeding.\\n\\nUnlike moose, which usually runs to the road suddenly and alone, the reindeer hang around peacefully in groups and collisions are usually easy to avoid if slowing down at once when the first reindeer appear in sight (drive carefully, as they may suddenly regroup in front of your car).\\n\\n====Winter driving====\\nDriving in Arctic conditions can be [[winter driving|hazardous in winter]]. Ask about conditions for the minor roads, as winter maintenance may not be what you expected. You will certainly not want to use summer tyres in wintry conditions; use '''Nordic winter tyres''', which are soft enough also at low temperatures. \\n\\nThe most dangerous weather is when the temperature is around freezing, when slippery but near-invisible '''black ice''' forms on the roads or the icy surface is wet. Do not venture out before you understand the issues, and make sure the windows are clear from snow and moisture. Locals are trained for those slippery conditions already in the driving school, are you?\\n\\nMain roads are cleared from loose snow, but you'll drive on packed snow. Some small roads are not maintained in winter at all. Small roads that are cleared may still have issues with a slippery ice slope sideways, as water flowing down a hillside under the snow freezes on the exposed road (\\\"naled\\\", Finnish: ''paannej\\u00e4\\u00e4'').\\n\\nLiikenneturva, the Finnish road safety agency, maintains a [https://www.liikenneturva.fi/en/road-safety/difficult-driving-conditions/ Difficult driving conditions] page in English.\\n\\n===Hitchhiking=== \\nHichhiking is possible and in fact quite popular. Also the locals commonly use Facebook groups for intervillage commuting. However, true hitchhiking can only be recommended during the brief summer season. Traffic is sparse even on the main roads and outside the town you're very, very much on your own. On the other hand the likeliness of getting a lift is quite high once a car passes! Far more likely than in the southern cities. Close to the borders people are usually more likely to drive towards the border than into the inland. Especially, getting a hike from Utsjoki to Inari or from Enenteki\\u00f6 to Kittil\\u00e4 may appear tricky as few have any need to drive south. Always make sure that you are able to survive if the next car won't come. Thanks to the Finnish rescue system, by calling 112 you will eventually be taken to safety. However, it may take hours. Realize the distances, necessity of the mosquito repellent, and make sure that someone always knows where you should be.\\n\\n===By snowmobile===\\n[[File:Moottorikelkka V\\u00e4rri\\u00f6n tutkimusasemalla 1.jpg|thumb|Snowmobile as serious transport, en route to the [[Savukoski|V\\u00e4rri\\u00f6]] research station]]\\n\\nIn winter there are some 20,000 km of snowmobile routes and tracks in Finland maintained by municipalities or the forestry administration (Mets\\u00e4hallitus), mostly in Lapland but stretching down to Central Finland and Northern Karelia. The routes often pass by campfire sites, day huts, reservation huts and other infrastructure in the wilderness (but using open wilderness huts for overnight stay is allowed only for those coming by own muscle, you have to pay for beds in reservation huts or other lodgings unless sleeping in tents).\\n\\nYou need the vehicle, suitable gear, helmets, a driving licence (one for cars or motorbikes is enough) for the \\\"routes\\\" or a permit for most \\\"tracks\\\"; \\\"routes\\\" are counted as public roads, the permits count as landowner permission for the specific tracks it covers. The Mets\\u00e4hallitus permit costs \\u20ac9/3h, \\u20ac15/day, \\u20ac30/week, \\u20ac50/year, the last covering all family (not independent children). In many areas the municipality or tourist businesses maintain their own track network. Snowmobiling along roads or off the specific routes and tracks is not permitted (exceptions for reindeer husbandry etc., which may apply to your tour guide); on frozen water driving is free where not specifically restricted, but mind [[ice safety]]! Check route maps and driving rules. Drive gently and follow advice, as it is easy for the less seasoned to make fatal mistakes.\\n\\nThere is an OSM based colour coded [https://www.kelkkareitit.fi route and track map]{{Dead link|date=June 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} in Finnish; click the leg you are interested in: ''Moottorikelkkareitti'' (blue) means snowmobile route, ''Maksuton moottorikelkkaura'' (purple) free track, ''Maksullinen moottorikelkkaura'' (red) permit-for-pay, ''Vesist\\u00f6n ylitys'' (grey) by water, ''Tuntematon'' (black) unknown type.

The locals, especially those in reindeer husbandry or fishing, use snowmobiles extensively. They were the main invention that allowed people to live in a fixed home while living from reindeer husbandry.\\n\\n==See and do==\\n[[File:Sunset in Lapland.jpg|thumb|In midwinter there are only a few hours of daylight, if any]]\\n[[File:The S\\u00e4rest\\u00f6niemi Museum Farm House and the Old Sa.jpg|thumb|[[Kittil\\u00e4#Q30560590|S\\u00e4rest\\u00f6niemi museum]], with traditional buildings, in Kittil\\u00e4]]\\n[[File:Pyh\\u00e4-Luosto National Park (4867023642).jpg|thumb|A hiking route through a deep ravine in the [[Pyh\\u00e4-Luosto National Park]]]]\\n\\n{{See also|Hiking in the Nordic countries}}\\n\\nBitterly cold in winter, usually not very warm in summer, and sparsely populated, the main draws for visitors are the desolate yet majestic '''nature''' and the unparalleled opportunities for '''[[wilderness backpacking|trekking]]''' and '''[[winter sports]]'''. Many businesses know how to help inexperienced foreigners enjoy their stay, e.g. arranging husky or snowmobile safaris, fishing trips, canoeing and northern light watching expeditions.\\n\\nFinland had its own gold rushes, to Lapland. The heritage is preserved in [[Lemmenjoki National Park]], the nearby [[Ivalo#Do|Hammastunturi Wilderness Area]] and the village [[Tankavaara]]. In the national park, digging by machine is nowadays forbidden, but gold panners can still be found \\u2013 as can traces of the activity. In the Hammastunturi area, where gold was found in the 19th century, before roads reached this north, there is an old crown station. Tankavaara has tourist facilities, a mineral exhibition and gold panning championships.\\n\\nSeveral [[Finnish National Parks|national parks]] can be found in Lapland with marked hiking trails and log cabins open to the public for free. But in contrast to most of Norway, they are only equipped with a stove and wood for heating, no food is provided. For the hardcore trekker there are ''wilderness areas'', with even fewer people and services. To go on your own, basic hiking skills suffice in summer (be sure to know how to use a map and compass). During the spring floods and in winter you should have a guide on any longer trek unless you really know what you are doing.\\n\\nLapland is locally known for its fells (''tunturi''), but these are not any soaring mountains of the alpine kind, but gentle, rounded ones high enough to reach above the treeline (which is much below 1000 m at these latitudes). There are also vast forests and mires in hilly or flat terrain. In the northernmost regions ([[Utsjoki]] and [[Enonteki\\u00f6]]) you will find also treeless areas, but real tundra is absent in Finland. The highest mountains are located in the \\\"arm of Finland\\\" in [[Enonteki\\u00f6]], but because of the location of the road right next to the fells, best views are actually towards Sweden. Still there are magnificent environments available for hikers!\\n\\nFinland's highest mountain, '''Halti''' (1328m) in the farthest north west end of Lapland is not much more than a higher hill of loose rocks, the lower summit of a mountain with its top on the Norwegian side of the border. [[K\\u00e4sivarsi Wilderness Area|The surroundings]] are still very special and a popular, demanding destination. You are nowadays free to cross the border to Norway or Sweden and back where you want (customs formalities, if needed, can probably be taken care of beforehand). An itinerary that takes full advantage of this is the [[Nordkalottleden]] hiking trail through the Arctic of the three countries.\\n\\nFor hikers, fishermen and hunters, there is a nice online [http://www.retkikartta.fi/?lang=en map] of Finland with most trails and huts marked, and a website about most important [http://www.nationalparks.fi hiking terrains]. Both are maintained by Mets\\u00e4hallitus, an agency that also administers the national parks.\\n\\nThere are of course also cultural events. You might want to attend the international [http://www.msfilmfestival.fi Midnight Sun film festival of Sodankyl\\u00e4] or S\\u00e1mi events such as the [https://www.marianpaivat.fi St Mary's Day Celebrations].\\n\\n===Northern lights===\\n[[File:Aurora borealis in Ruka, Finland.jpg|thumb|Northern lights in [[Ruka]].]]\\n\\n{{see also|Northern Lights}}\\n\\nSpotting the eerie northern lights (''aurora borealis'', Finnish: ''revontulet'', Northern S\\u00e1mi: ''guovssahas'', Skolt Sami: ''kuusk\\u00f5\\u00f5zz'') glowing in the winter sky is on the agenda of many visitors. Northern Lapland is one of the best places to observe aurorae, as it has good accessibility, high-quality accommodation and a nearly continental climate with relatively clear skies. The probability of some northern lights is 50\\u201370 % (most often 22:00\\u201324:00) any night with clear skies, and light pollution is quite easy to avoid here \\u2013 but there are cloudy periods, so do not count on seeing them.\\n\\nAlso in southern Lapland, where probability is about 20 %, you might want to take a walk somewhere out of the light pollution any night with clear skies. If you do not spot northern lights, you will at least get a tremendous view of stars, compared to what you see in most cities.\\n\\nTo have a good chance to see northern lights you should stay at least a few days, preferably a week or more, in the far north in the right season. Probability for aurorae and clear skies varies somewhat from place to place, but all of northern Lapland, about from Sodankyl\\u00e4 onwards, should be quite good. More importantly, as you need some luck and persistence, you want to go somewhere where you can enjoy yourself regardless. The ski resort of [[Saariselk\\u00e4]], easily accessible by plane and with plenty of facilities, is particularly popular among aurora hunters. If you enjoy wilderness and solitude, e.g. areas around [[Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi]] and [[Karigasniemi]] might be good choices. The village of Nellim is even more remote, being situated on the almost uninhabited eastern side of Lake Inari, where light pollution is at a minimum.\\n\\nCloudiness can be quite accurately estimated some hours, chance for major aurorae a few days in advance, so you can know when to go for a tour and when to spend the night in other ways \\u2013 but as also minor aurorae are well visible in Lapland, you might want to be out any night with clear skies. Intense aurorae occur for 5\\u201315 minutes at a time, so taking a look at the northern sky every now and then over a longer period will increase your chances.\\n\\nMany businesses arrange northern light watching tours. Usually the tours also have some other theme, such that not seeing the aurorae will not spoil it, but taking care of being in the right place would the aurorae be visible. A week of backcountry skiing will offer even better opportunities unless you spend the best hours in your tent or a hut. A hotel in Kakslauttanen has glass-domed igloo rooms where you can watch northern lights indoors the whole night.\\n\\n===Reindeer and snowmobiles===\\n[[File:Reindeer Ride.jpg|thumb|Reindeer ride near [[Ruka]]]]\\n\\nMost of Lapland belongs to the reindeer husbandry area, and nearly all wilderness is in use as reindeer pasture (mostly forested areas in winter and treeless areas in summer). On a week-long hike you are nearly guaranteed to see them in the wild, but at most locations there will also be at least some tourist business having a few tame ones to show, or even to offer rides with (usually by sled). If you make friends with locals you might have a chance to see the round-ups.\\n\\nOther standard tourist programmes include snowmobile \\\"safaris\\\", i.e. tours, where you usually are allowed to drive your own vehicle (children are probably put in a sled behind your guide), and husky safaris, where you get to try being pulled by dogs. Snowmobiles are probably available for hire if you want to make longer tours on your own.\\n\\nThe tours with dogs, reindeer and snowmobiles can be combined with fishing (ice-fishing in the winter), admiring northern lights or the midnight sun, story-telling and roasting salmon by a campfire, sauna, overnight stay in a goahti and the like. What is available depends on who happens to have a business in the neighbourhood, check what is offered at the business where you intend to be lodging, at least if you do not stay at the bigger resorts. You might want to stay with a family business with the right spirit, especially if you have come to enjoy silence.\\n\\n===Skiing and snowshoeing===\\n[[File:Cross Country Skiing (6827042104).jpg|thumb|Skiing through the forest on prepared tracks]]\\n\\nThe ski resorts do not have the greatest [[Downhill snowsports|pists]], if you compare to the Alps or Norway, but they are good enough for most. On the balance they have lots of accessible wilderness close by, to be experienced by snowmobile or by ski. There are great networks of [[cross-country skiing]] tracks around any ski resort, often even a large national park. And tourist businesses eager to offer you other programmes.\\n\\nFor shorter excursions, as along signposted nature trails, you can often use snowshoes. For longer hikes, of more than about a kilometre, skis are much better, easily giving you a jogging speed on any level track. Around the resorts and town centres there are illuminated tracks with space also for \\\"freestyle\\\" skiing. Many businesses offer ten-minutes courses combined with tours in the forest, showing signs of the local wildlife and letting you enjoy the peace and possibly a marvellous view of stars.\\n\\nFor overnight (or multiple-day) hikes on ski you usually want skis that don't let you down even if you leave the tracks. There are ready made tracks for \\\"classic\\\" skiing extending far into the wilderness, but they are not necessarily maintained very soon after snowfall \\u2013 and you might want to choose routes where no tracks have been made. There are lean-to shelters (Finnish: ''laavu'') and wilderness huts (''autiotupa'' and ''varaustupa''), so overnighting in a tent is seldom necessary, but sleeping bags and other adequate equipment may be needed.\\n\\nMost tourists want a lot of action in a tight package, so that is what most businesses offer (even if peace and silence, in a suitable packing, often is included). If you really want peace and silence, as on a multi-day skiing tour through the wilderness, you should search for such offers in time \\u2013 there are guides specializing in that, but they may not be available on short notice.\\n\\n===Father Christmas===\\n[[File:Arctic circle santa village.jpg|thumb|The Santa Claus Village in Rovaniemi]]\\n\\nActivities related to Santa Claus, or ''Joulupukki'' as the Finns call him, are arranged at least in Rovaniemi and Luosto, probably in most resorts. His main reception and workshop is in Rovaniemi, for tourists' convenience, but most Finns grew up knowing his home is at the fell Korvatunturi. Usually he arrives by foot, having left his sled somewhere farther away, but he can also turn up by a sled pulled by a horse, and possibly reindeer (the flying ones are disappointingly on vacation by themselves when not doing their yearly main job).\\n\\n[[Savukoski#Korvatunturi fell|Korvatunturi]] is secluded, in [[Urho Kekkonen National Park]] at the Russian border and thus in the border zone, so visiting the fell requires effort and paperwork. Even if you get the permit, it is rare that Joulupukki lets strangers see him there, and his home is not easy to find. There is a hiking trail to ''Korvatunturinmurusta'' (2\\u00b720 km, the trailhead requiring a ''long'' journey along small and even smaller roads), from where you can get a glimpse of the fell, and who knows, he might reward you for the effort by really showing up! At least he will answer mail addressed to Korvatunturi (write to: Joulupukki, FIN-99999 Korvatunturi).\\n\\n===Fishing===\\nFishing is an important reason for Finns to come to Lapland, and traditionally it was an essential food source up north. Many villages have formed at good fishing sites. There are some great salmon rivers, Teno being the most productive salmon river in all of Europe. Also e.g. trout, greyling and Arctic char are common catches. Catch-and-release fishing is generally not practised.\\n\\nAngling without reel and without artificial lure, or with a special ice angling rod, is generally included to the [[right to access]] \\u2013 but in any river with salmonoids and in many lakes, there are restrictions in place, and there are also general restrictions on minimum sizes etc. According to Finnish law it is always the fisherman's own responsibility to find out whether there are restrictions on the area.\\n\\nIf you come for the fishing, you probably want to have a reel or use one of the restricted locations. You then need a ''national fishing permit'' and a ''day card for the specific area''. Most tourist businesses will gladly fix those for you, explain the regulations, and rent you equipment you need. Notice that in Northern Lapland the locals enjoy privileges that visitors will not have.\\n\\nFor rivers flowing to the Atlantic (the Barents and White Sea, including those flowing into Lake Inari), all your '''equipment must be disinfected''' (e.g. by thorough drying) in advance. This is to prevent the ''Gyrodactylus salaris'' parasite from spreading from the Baltic Sea basin, as it would be catastrophic in these rivers. Some Atlantic rivers have got it, so disinfection is necessary unless you know you come from a \\\"clean\\\" one. Disinfection applies also to canoe and boots \\u2013 and don't let birds carry it over with your gutting waste. The easiest way is to let your host do the disinfection as disinfection services are available somewhat everywhere in the areas where the procedure is mandatory. If you cross the border to Norway the law is tighter; you need to possess a written certificate on disinfection even if you wouldn't go ashore.\\n\\n===Hunting===\\n[[Hunting#Finland|Hunting]] is popular in Lapland but is usually off-limits for an ordinary visitor. Some tourist businesses take you on tours where you hunt ''under the close supervision'' of your guide, which means you do not need own licences. If you have qualifications in your home country you may apply for corresponding licences from Finnish authorities or they might suffice as such, and you might be able to get a permit for some areas. Prepare for bureaucracy.\\n\\n==Work==\\nThe ski resorts and many other tourist businesses depend on seasonal workers. As a significant part of the clients are from abroad, being a foreigner is not necessarily a drawback in getting jobs, especially if you know the right languages or cultures \\u2013 as long as you have or can get a work permit, possibly with help from your to-be employer (reserve enough time for the bureaucracy). Skiing teachers, restaurant and bar personnel, entertainment, child care, what have you. Some jobs require formal qualifications or advanced skills and experience, while for some the right attitude will get you a long way, much more so than for most jobs in Finland.\\n\\nCommon languages to use with clients include English, Russian, German and French, but also some languages from the Far East, where competition from Finns is very limited. Different resorts to some extent concentrate on different groups; try to find an employer who needs your specialities.\\n\\nForeign seasonal workers (especially those from outside the EU/EEA) have a weak position and some employers do exploit the fact. Make sure you get a proper employment contract, make notes and keep evidence on any irregularities and don't make yourself reliant on a possibly untrustworthy employer. Overtime, night-time work and any expectations to be available on \\\"free\\\" time should get compensated according to the contract, the trade union agreements and labour law; in many places such issues are handled informally, but then the employer should be equally flexible regarding your wishes and you should be happy about the arrangements. If you think things aren't handled as they should, don't hesitate to ask for outside advice (if you are afraid to do that, or to discuss them with your colleagues, you should definitely find a way out).\\n\\n==Eat==\\n[[File:Poronk\\u00e4ristys.jpg|thumb|upright|Poronk\\u00e4ristys at a hotel.]]\\n\\nLapland is the place to sample '''reindeer''' (''poro'') dishes, which are not too common elsewhere in Finland. The traditional way to eat this is as '''saut\\u00e9ed reindeer''' aka '''reindeer hash''' (''poronk\\u00e4ristys''), usually eaten with mashed potatoes and lingonberry jam. Also smoked cold cuts and '''dried reindeer meat''' are definitely worth trying. In very rare occasions you could face some really interesting reindeer dishes like ''kampsut'' made of blood and flour, or ''koparakeitto'', a traditional reindeer hoof soup.\\n\\nOther Lapland specialties worth looking for are '''willow ptarmigan''' and '''rock ptarmigan''' (''riekko'' and ''kiiruna'', respectively) and fish such as '''arctic char''' (''rautu'') or '''lavaret''' (''siika''). The delectable '''cloudberry''' (''hilla'' or ''lakka'') is one of the most expensive berries in the world. It grows on mires, unripe it is red, ripe it is light orange, containing a lot of vitamin C. In shops you find it most likely as jam (''lakkahillo'') or syrup. The '''Crowberry''' (''kaarnikka'' or ''variksenmarja'') is also a delicious specialty that is rarely encountered any place elsewhere, and usually sold as juice (you will found it abundantly in the fells, but it is small with big seeds, so not as tempting to eat directly).\\n\\nThe '''Norwegian angelica''' (''v\\u00e4in\\u00f6nputki'') is a traditional herb highly appreciated by the S\\u00e1mi; the angelica is also used e.g. in the French chartreuse and b\\u00e9n\\u00e9dictine liqueurs. It has found its way to some handicraft delicacies. Some related species are very poisonous, so check if you want to look for it yourself.\\n\\n'''''Rieska''''' is a barley flatbread traditional to the area. The almond-shaped '''''puikula''''' (often as ''Lapin puikula'') potatoes are also a local specialty, although sold and appreciated around the country.\\n\\nNB! Reindeer meat and cloudberry products are always relatively expensive; especially when buying cold cuts make sure the package says ''poro'' somewhere. Seeing similar looking but much cheaper horsemeat and beef cuts sold right next to the reindeer meat is unfortunately common. Cheap cloudberry jams usually contain orange (''appelsiini''). Check the small-print mandatory ingredients list, to see not only what the producers want to tell.\\n\\n==Drink==\\nMost nightlife is concentrated to [[Kemi]] and [[Rovaniemi]], and especially at wintertime: to the skiing resorts!\\n\\nWhen hiking in wilderness it is quite safe to drink water directly from rivers. Most hikers use water also from lakes and small clear streams untreated, but you might want to boil that for a few minutes.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n[[File:Kumputunturikittila.jpg|thumb|upright|Forest at Kumputunturi in [[Kittil\\u00e4]].]]\\n\\n{{see also|Hiking in the Nordic countries#Sleep}}\\n\\nThere are lots of good quality '''hotels and hostels''' around Lapland. The scale goes from luxury suites to pole tents where you can sleep next to an open fire. There are also glass igloos for watching northern lights and hotels within snow castles. At least for a longer stay or away from towns you might want to rent a '''cottage''' instead. Know what kind of cottage you want, they and their environment and nearby services vary widely. Also check the specific location; a search often suggests cottages that actually are a hundred kilometres from the intended destination.\\n\\nMost accommodations also have programme services (and may market other available programmes as their own).\\n\\nMany of the hotels and programme services are owned by big companies and largely staffed with seasonal workers mostly from elsewhere. If you want to use a local business or to interact with local staff, you have to search carefully. Some small businesses are run by people with roots elsewhere who fell in love with Lapland; those may also be interesting options.\\n\\nAt many hiking destinations there are Spartan '''open wilderness huts''' available for free, or '''reservation huts''' with some equipment for a very moderate price (\\u20ac15/person/night, check where to get the key). These have firewood, a wood stove for heat and possibly cooking, sometimes a gas stove and pots for cooking, bunk beds with or without mattresses (reservation respectively open huts), an outhouse toilet (use own toilet paper), and some sort of water resource nearby, but hardly anything else (no electricity, no lights). In the open wilderness huts you may stay a night or two, but if the place gets crowded the ones who have had their rest should leave \\u2013 the ones who come last have an indisputable right to the facilities. Leave the hut in better condition than it was when you arrived. In addition to these there are lean-to shelters and \\\"lapp pole tents\\\", which give some protection from the elements, and \\\"day huts\\\", meant for breaks but usable for overnight stay in emergencies.\\n\\nAccording to the [[Right to access|Everyman's Right]] (''jokamiehenoikeus'') one can set up a \\\"temporary\\\" camp (at least a night or two) nearly anywhere in the forest or on the fell, no matter who owns the land. However, making a fire is allowed only in extreme situations or by permission of landowner. For the campfire sites in national parks, and some wilderness and backcountry areas, there is a general permit. If a wildfire warning is in effect making a fire is forbidden, no matter whether or not you have a permission. In protected areas, such as national parks, there are restrictions also on camping.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n[[File:N\\u00e4kym\\u00e4 Kovddoskaisilta.JPG|thumb|Mountain landscape seen from Kovddoskaisi in [[K\\u00e4sivarsi Wilderness Area]], [[Enonteki\\u00f6]]. Patches of snow remaining in late July.]]\\n\\nKnow your limits. The winter environment is perfectly capable of killing the unwary tourist who gets lost in the fells. The rescue service works well \\u2013 each year several tourists are rescued and only rarely any serious injury is sustained \\u2013 but taking your chances is not recommended.\\n\\n[[Snow safety|Avalanches]] are possible in winter. Check with the national parks or ski resorts and make sure you know what you are doing or how to avoid affected areas, if venturing out in wilderness or on non-maintained slopes.\\n\\nIf you plan to travel alone or, for example in your own car, remember that distances are great and getting help for any unexpected situation may take time. Plan accordingly; take extra warm clothes in your car and tell the hotel staff where you are heading and when you expect to come back.\\n\\nAlso mind the hunting season: Natives are usually very keen of hunting, and the start of the season draws most hunters into the wilderness. Potential dangers can be countered by wearing a red cap or some other easily identified garment.\\n\\nWhen stopping on the road to enjoy the landscape, don't forget the traffic. Park at a safe spot and keep to the roadside.<!-- negligence reported to be all too common -->\\n\\nOtherwise, there are few serious dangers to your well-being. Tap water and even water of most lakes and creeks is potable (in most places, bottled water contains more harmful compounds than tap water) and foods are almost without exception safe to eat. Crime rates are low and people are helpful and nice. Probability to get robbed or getting any other harm is extremely low. Still avoid getting drunk and noisy at ski resorts (either alone is probably not a big problem safety-wise).\\n\\nThere are rescue helicopters, which should be able to reach you in an hour or two even in the wilderness, weather permitting. There are prepared landing spots by many wilderness huts. If venturing out, you might want to check instructions, otherwise just know your coordinates and some landmarks to make any confusion obvious (the operators have maps to which to compare your description), let the crew decide on where to land, and stay clear of landing aircraft (stones and branches may transform into projectiles). Often a snowmobile or other land vehicles may be enough to reach you.\\n\\n=== Hospitals ===\\nThere should be health care centres in all municipalities, but hours are limited and some services may be available at even more limited hours. You can call for advice.\\n\\nLikewise, there should be pharmacies in all municipalities, and there may be limited pharmacy services at some business in major villages.\\n\\nIn emergencies, call 112, which should be able to send any appropriate unit. There is a medical helicopter, the voluntary fire brigades may offer prehospital care, and the ski resorts may have their own arrangements.\\n\\n* '''Central Hospital of Lapland''' (''Lapin Keskussairaala'') is in [[Rovaniemi]] taking care of tourists with acute illnesses or accidents. The general emergency clinic is open 24 hr daily ({{phone|+358 16 328-2140}}).\\n* '''L\\u00e4nsi-Pohja Central Hospital''' (''L\\u00e4nsi-Pohjan keskussairaala'') in [[Kemi]] has a 24 hr daily emergency clinic, ({{phone|+358 40-149-1340}}).\\n\\n==Go next==\\n* [[Finnmark]] \\u2013 the Norwegian equivalent, still more to the north, bordering the Arctic Ocean.\\n* [[Murmansk Oblast]] \\u2014 though voyagers of most nationalities need a visa to visit Russia.\\n* Swedish Lapland in [[Norrland]] \\u2013 with higher mountains.\\n\\n{{IsPartOf|Northern Finland}}\\n{{usableregion}}\\n{{geo|67.86743|25.86731|zoom=6}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Northwest territories banner Third Canyon Nahanni.jpg|caption=Third Canyon, Nahanni National Park Reserve}}\\nThe '''Northwest Territories''' (NWT) is a vast wilderness area that is a part of [[Northern Canada]]. Summer in the NWT offers open water, camping, hot weather and the [[midnight sun]]. Autumn offers vivid colours in the mountains and bountiful berry-picking in the Barrenlands, and excellent opportunities to see the Aurora Borealis.  Winter is an even better time to see the [[Northern Lights]] when the sky is clear and the nights are long.  Springtime is ideal for snowmobiling, dogsledding, ice-fishing, and skiing.\\n\\n==Regions==\\n{{Mapshape|wikidata=Q2007|type=geomask}}{{mapframe|71.5|-120.76|zoom=3|width=300|height=375}}\\nThe Northwest Territories is divided into five regions, which roughly correspond to the territories of the original native inhabitants:\\n*South Slave (South of Great Slave Lake).  The main communities in this region are [[Hay River]] and Fort Smith.\\n*North Slave (North of Great Slave Lake).  The main community in this region is the capital, [[Yellowknife]].\\n*Deh Cho.  The main community in this region is Fort Simpson.\\n*Sahtu.  The main community in this region is Norman Wells.\\n*Beaufort Delta/Arctic Coast, which can be further broken down into the Gwich'in and Inuvialuit settlement areas.

See [[Indigenous cultures of North America]].\\n\\nIts terrain includes [[boreal forest]] (taiga) and tundra, and its most northern regions form part of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.\\n\\n===History===\\nThe Northwest Territories was created to encompass all of the Canadian territories to the west and north of [[Ontario]] (hence the name \\u2018Northwest\\u2019 Territories). \\n\\nAll of the land which drained into Hudson's Bay once belonged to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] as \\\"Rupert's Land\\\". Parts of that land later became NWT, which covered a vast area. Through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, NWT lands were transferred to provinces, or separated to create the [[Prairies_(Canada)|Prairie provinces]]. For instance, all of [[Lloydminster]] used to be part of NWT; it was divided on longitude 110\\u00b0W upon the creation of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]].\\n\\nFor a century, the name was a bit of a misnomer, as the Northwest Territories contained the Arctic Archipelago, which extended far east. The [[Yukon]] Territory was carved out of NWT in 1898. The primarily-Inuit [[Nunavut]] Territory seceded in 1999.\\n\\nTo some, the name remains a misnomer as NWT is just one of the three Canadian territories, and it is only \\\"northwest\\\" relative to some other jurisdiction \\u2013 presumably Ontario. A singular name \\\"Northwest Territory\\\" is avoided due to its historic use for an \\\"Old Northwest\\\" that became [[United States of America|U.S.]] states [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]] and part of [[Minnesota]]. Some advocate native-language names for the territory but there has been no clear consensus.\\n\\n===Tourist information===\\n*[https://spectacularnwt.com/ Spectacular Northwest Territories] website\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\nFlights connect [[Yellowknife]] with [[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary]] in Alberta, and [[Vancouver]], British Columbia. There are seasonal flights from [[Whitehorse]], Yukon, [[Toronto]] and [[Ottawa]], Ontario.\\n\\n===By car===\\nFrom Alberta, Highway 16 leaves from Edmonton to connect to Highway 43.  Highway 43 (part of [[Mackenzie Highway]]) heads north towards NWT becoming NWT Highway 1 (part of Mackenzie Highway).  Turn on to NWT Highway 3 to take you to [[Yellowknife]]. The journey is about {{km|1450}}, and there are long distances between gas (petrol) stations. Do your research, and be prepared.\\n\\nThe [[Dempster Highway]] (Yukon Highway 5 and NWT Highway 8) connects [[Inuvik]] with the Klondike Highway near [[Dawson City]], Yukon.\\n\\n===By train===\\nThere are no passenger railways in NWT.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\nOne of the best ways to get around the Northwest Territories is by car. This gives you unlimited freedom to choose your own itinerary.\\n\\nPicture the scene - you're driving down the highway and you look to your left, you see a vast expanse of wilderness, maybe a picturesque sunset and even a herd of caribou (reindeer) going about their business. You look to the right and a black bear is peeping out from behind trees. With uninterrupted views of the wide open space and wildlife, you will be alert to all the new sights and sounds until you come across a sleepy little community that offers a camping ground with a small restaurant of home cooked delights and a welcoming atmosphere.\\n\\nThe territorial government operates free ferries on four unbridged river crossings in summer: at the Liard River near Fort Simpson, the Peel River near [[Fort McPherson]], and the Mackenzie River near Wrigley and at Tsiigehtchic. In winter, the government maintains a number of ice roads at these river crossings and elsewhere.\\n\\nCar hire is a good resource to make the most of in the Northwest Territories. Reliable and cost effective, car hire companies will be able to advise you of the best routes to spot wildlife and the best routes to take you from waterfall to river to lake.\\n\\nAnother of the best ways to travel around the Northwest Territories is by plane, due to the airports dotting the landscape, as well as the lack of roads and rails throughout many parts of the Northwest Territories. (Indeed, passenger rail service has yet to be extended to the Territories.) Yellowknife essentially began partially through the efforts of bush pilots, and float planes can presumably land on the territories' many lakes (they are known to land in Yellowknife Bay). Airline service can be had to Yellowknife, Fort Good Hope, Fort Liard, Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, Hay River, Inuvik, Norman Wells, and other communities, and bush pilots presumably reach further.\\n\\n==See==\\nYou must see  the '''[[Northern Lights|Aurora Borealis]]''' (Northern Lights). They are best seen in wintertime, when the nights are long. They cannot be seen at all during the short \\\"white nights\\\" around the summer solstice. Tour companies in Yellowknife offer snowmobile, sled dog expeditions, photography workshops and tractor rides to see the lights from places outside of town.\\n\\n'''Great Slave Lake''', on the shore of which sits the town of Hay River, is the deepest lake in North America at {{m|614}}.\\n[[File:Hwy 5 to Inuvik - the Dempster Hwy.

And its '''Great Northern Arts Festival''' in the middle of July draws artists come from across the north, other parts of Canada, and Alaska. '''The Beluga Jamboree''' in Tuktoyaktuk in April is a large cultural festival full of games, food, and a Jamboree King and Queen competition\\n\\nTours are available from Hay River for summer and ice '''fishing''' on Great Slave Lake for whitefish, lake trout, and perch.

It protects the largest intact boreal forest on earth, contains the largest freshwater inland delta on earth, and is home to a herd of rare wood bison (or \\\"wood buffalo\\\").\\n\\n==Understand==\\nThis region is primarily is part of the sparsly populated [[boreal forest]]. The world famous (or infamous) Athabasca Oilsands (aka the \\\"tar sands\\\", a term that is locally viewed with negative connotations) are located here.\\n\\n===History ===\\nThe region was first populated by indigenous peoples. The Chipewyan people (who are part of the Dene or Athapascan language family) lived here at the beginnings of European contact (early 1700s), but were soon joined by the Cree people (from the Algonquian language family) from the east. Both peoples were nomadic and hunted bison (aka \\\"buffalo\\\") on the plains and moose (aka \\\"elk\\\") in the forests and also harvested with many smaller game animals, fish, berries, roots, and so on. The Athabasca oil sands were known to the indigenous peoples and the surface deposits were used to waterproof their canoes. During the fur trade, the location of Fort McMurray was an important junction on the fur trade route from eastern Canada to the Athabasca country. In 1778, the first European explorer, Peter Pond, came to the region in search of furs, as the European demand for this commodity at the time was strong. Pond explored the region farther south along the Athabasca River and the Clearwater River, but chose to set up a trading post much farther north by the Athabasca River near Lake Athabasca. However, his post closed in 1788 in favour of Fort Chipewyan, now the oldest continuous settlement in Alberta.\\n\\nIn 1790, the explorer Alexander MacKenzie made the first recorded description of the oil sands. By that time, trading between the explorers and the Cree was already occurring at the confluence of the Clearwater and Athabasca Rivers. The Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company were in fierce competition in this region. Fort McMurray was established there as a Hudson's Bay Company post by 1870, named for the Chief Factor William McMurray. It continued to operate as a transportation stopover in the decades afterwards.\\n[[File:Oilsands1.jpg|right|thumb|Oil sands]]\\nOil exploration is known to have occurred in the early 20th century, but Fort McMurray's population remained small, no more than a few hundred people, until 1967 when the Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor) plant opened and Fort McMurray's growth soon took off. More oil sands plants were opened in the 1970s due to serious political tensions and conflicts in the Middle East triggered oil price spikes, resulting in significant growth, but slowed in the 1980s.\\n\\nIn 1995, the City of Fort McMurray and Improvement District No. 143 were amalgamated to form the Municipality of Wood Buffalo, renamed the Regional Municipality (RM) of Wood Buffalo in 1996. As a result, Fort McMurray is no longer designated a city. Instead, it is designated an urban service area within a specialized municipality. The amalgamation resulted in the entire RM of Wood Buffalo being under a single government. It is the second largest municipality in Alberta by area, and covers the entire region outside of Wood Buffalo National Park.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[File:Fort mcmurray northern lights.jpg|thumb|Aurora Borealis near Fort McMurray]]\\n\\n=== By plane ===\\nThe main airport for the region is Fort McMurray Airport ({{IATA|YMM}}) with service to Edmonton and Calgary, as well as connections to a variety of places across Canada (and sometimes to the USA) but the list grows and shrinks rapidly depending on the state of the oil industry.

The '''Southern Lights''' or '''''aurora australis''''' also occur but are not as often observed.\\n\\nTo observers at far-northern latitudes, the Lights are a frequent occurrence, but many who live in more temperate climates have never seen them, even though they are occasionally seen as far south as 35 degrees North latitude. This article will help you improve your chances of seeing the Lights if you journey north.\\n[[File:Aurora Borealis I.jpg|thumb|400px|Northern Lights near [[Troms\\u00f8]], [[Norway]]]]\\nThe aurorae are caused by charged particles ejected from the sun. When these particles reach the earth, they collide with gas molecules in the earth's upper atmosphere, energising them and creating a spectacular multi-coloured light show. Charged particles are affected by magnetic fields, so the Lights occur mainly at far northern or southern latitudes near the Earth's magnetic poles.\\n\\nThe Lights look somewhat similar to a sunset in the sky at night, but appear occasionally in arcs or spirals usually following the earth's magnetic field. They fairly often look like moving curtains of light, high in the sky. They are most often light green in color but often have a hint of pink. Strong eruptions also have violet and white colors. Red northern lights are rare, but are sometimes observed.\\n\\nThe Lights are generally fairly dim, but sometimes bright enough that reading a newspaper on a moonless night is possible. Both brightness and how far from the poles they are visible vary according to three factors: time of year, an 11-year cycle in solar activity, and solar storms. These are discussed in more detail later.\\n\\nLight pollution around cities can mask a dim aurora display. Therefore, areas at least 30 km from cities are preferred for viewing. The trick is to get far enough from cities for good viewing (generally easy, since most northern areas are not heavily populated) ''without'' taking undue risks in a climate that can easily kill you.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Map auroral oval mostly canada.png|thumb|200px|Northern Lights oval, 2007]]\\n\\nContrary to intuition, seeing the Northern Lights isn't just a matter of heading north. The Lights occur mainly in a circular or elliptical band centered on the earth's North ''Magnetic'' Pole, which is not at the same location as the [[North Pole | North ''Geographic'' Pole]].\\n\\nThe exact location of the North Magnetic Pole varies. Until early in this century, the pole was moving slowly (about 10 km/year) north across [[Ellesmere Island]] in the nearly uninhabited far north of [[Canada]]. Since the beginning  of the  21st century, the pole has been moving faster, for reasons scientists are not yet certain of. As of late 2019 it is out in the Arctic Ocean well north of Ellesmere, and moving toward Russia at about 55 km/year. Because of the movement, the advantages of being on the \\\"right side\\\" of the earth are becoming less pronounced, but there is still a slight North American bias in your chance of seeing the Lights.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|thumb|200px|Southern Lights seen from space]]\\n\\nAuroral displays aren't strongest ''at'' the pole; the band of greatest activity is offset from the Magnetic Pole by 20 degrees or so; the magnetic lines of force are curved and the curvature creates the offset. The '''Northern Lights oval''', meaning the area with the highest probability of seeing the Lights, covers most of [[Alaska]], northern parts of [[Canada]], the southern half of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], northern [[Norway]] and the northernmost areas of [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], as well as the western half of the Russian north. There is a similar oval in the South; see the photo.\\n\\nRegions such as the central and southern parts of the [[Nordic countries]], southern Canada, the north-central [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Scotland]] also frequently see Northern Lights, but not as often as directly under the Northern Lights oval. [[Svalbard]] sees Northern Lights less often than Northern Scandinavia, but is a place to observe the fainter Day Northern Lights visible during waking hours in its long [[polar night]]. \\n\\nThat said, the actual latitudes of the Lights vary considerably. In times of high solar activity (more on that later), the Lights may be seen in North America at latitudes as low as 35 degrees North, meaning that all but the southernmost parts of the United States may get a display. The offset of the Pole keeps solar storms from benefiting Europe quite as strongly, but most of the countries of northern Europe will get displays during periods of solar storms.\\n\\n==Planning==\\nThere is no guarantee of seeing the Northern Lights even if you are in the best areas at the best time, and there is some chance in others areas and seasons. However, a bit of planning will radically increase your chances. In short, pick somewhere on or very near the oval and go in winter.\\n\\n===Time of year===\\n[[File:AuroraBuryatia.jpg|thumb|400px|Lights in Scandinavia]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\nDarkness is required. Most Northern Lights locations are at high latitudes, in areas that get the \\\"[[midnight sun]]\\\"; there is no darkness from late April until mid-August, or even longer in far northern locations like [[Svalbard]]. Places within eight degrees of latitude south of the Arctic Circle, such as [[Yellowknife]] in Canada, experience \\\"white nights\\\", with only a few hours of twilight between dusk and dawn, at this time of year. In this period, no Northern Lights can be observed.\\n\\nIn the most intense Northern Lights areas, right on the oval, the lights are sometimes observed in any season but chances are best when it is dark after 6pm, from late September to late March. \\n\\nOn a yearly basis, the Lights are at their peak around the time of the equinoxes, in September and March.  The reasons for this trend aren't fully known, but it's definitely real, not just an artifact of the weather or other viewing conditions. Also, if you are planning to do other activities during the day, this is a good time to visit because you can enjoy twelve hours of daylight and still have a good chance of seeing the aurora at night. Temperatures are also milder than in mid-winter.\\n\\n===Time of day===\\nThe time between 6PM and 1AM is the most intense period of the day. The highest probability within this timespan is between 10 and 11PM. However, this is a guideline, and during the Polar night aurorae can be observed as early as 4PM, and all through the night. The most intense displays last some 5\\u201315 minutes each. In periods of strong activity, one can generally expect flares starting in the early evening, peaking around 10pm, and going on into the early morning hours.\\n\\nEven with good clothing, few travellers can tolerate a long time outdoors in an arctic night and the nights generally get continuously colder from sunset until the morning sun starts to warm things up. Even if there are lights in the early evening, it may be best to set out at 9pm or so (sun time, check your timezone); this gives you a good chance of catching the peak display without being out too long or at the coldest times.\\n\\n===11-year cycle===\\nIn the longer term, auroral displays are correlated with an 11-year cycle in sunspot activity and other perturbations of the sun; the more restless the sun, the more aurorae. However, at the most favorable latitudes, the Lights are still likely to be seen even at solar minimum; it's mainly at lower latitudes that they get scarce during the inactive times. There is a maximum in solar activity around 2024.\\n\\n===Solar storms===\\nIn addition to these more or less regular variations in frequency of the aurora, there are also less predictable, erratic displays resulting from '''solar storms'''.  Some of these, particularly near solar-activity maximum, can lead to visible Northern Lights remarkably far south, if you're in an area with clear, transparent night skies. The largest recorded solar storm took place in 1859; the Lights were bright enough to read a newspaper in [[Boston]] (42\\u00b0N) and visible as far south as Mexico. That storm was powerful enough that telegraphs would work without their normal power source, some caught fire. A similar one would probably destroy most electronics.\\n\\nThe [[#Alerts|Alerts]] section below will help you stay on top of solar activity and prepare for some viewing when a solar storm does occur.\\n\\n===Clear skies===\\nLast but not least, don't forget the '''weather forecast''' &mdash; aurora occur very high up in the atmosphere, and if there are clouds in the way you will not see anything. In Northern Scandinavia, the weather is notably better towards the end of the Northern Lights season (February-March), than in the beginning. The weather is probably the most important success factor in the areas under the Northern Lights oval, where there are visible Northern Lights on up to 80% of all clear nights.\\n\\n==Prepare==\\n\\n===Alerts===\\nIf you have the luxury of being able to travel into aurora-viewing territory on short notice, you can improve your chances of seeing something by being aware of \\\"space weather,\\\" the things going on beyond the earth's atmosphere as a result of solar activity.\\n[[File:Aurora australis ISS 20120715.jpg|thumb|400px|Southern Lights seen from the International Space Station, with the Canadarm robotic arm in the foreground]]\\nA good site for space weather information is operated by the (US) [http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] (NOAA). Measurements aboard the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite are used for plotting maps of current extent and position of the auroral oval around both poles; see their [https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast forecast] which predicts intensity and geographical location of the auroral oval based on current solar wind conditions and interplanetary magnetic field virtually in real time. The maps also show the observation limits of current aurorae. The commercial site [http://www.spaceweather.com/ Space Weather] presents much of the same information in digested, more accessible form.\\n\\nThe University of Alaska Fairbanks maintains an [http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast Aurora Alert] website. For Finland, the Finnish Meteorological Institute has an [http://aurorasnow.fmi.fi/public_service/ activity forecast] and current data about magnetic activity. The Icelandic MET office provides a [http://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/ lights forecast] for Iceland including cloud cover prediction.\\n\\nActivity is mainly predicted from the readings taken by the NASA Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellites, which give a one-hour warning. Solar wind activity is characterized by three principal figures: the north-south component of the magnetic field (Bz), speed and density. When Bz is negative (southward), solar wind particles are best able to enter the atmosphere and give rise to aurorae. At high velocities, auroral activity may occur despite a moderately negative Bz. In geomagnetic storms, Bz fluctuates rapidly. Overall geomagnetic activity is characterized by the planetary K-index (Kp), for which predictions are issued. A Kp of 5 or higher occurs in storms and generally makes auroral viewing possible well South of the oval in the northern parts of Europe and the [[United States of America|continental U.S.]]\\n\\nLonger-term estimates can be made by observation of the Sun for bursts. However, the physical models are poorly developed, partly because only two satellites, ACE and DSCOVR, observe the solar wind before it hits the Earth, and the predictions are rather unreliable. The approximate day can be predicted, but whether the burst hits the Earth face-on and exactly when and at what force remains unknown. \\\"Nowcasting\\\" on the ground is done by measuring magnetic field fluctuations, and there are webcams pointed at the sky for directly seeing the aurorae. The NASA Polar and Environmental Satellites (POES) directly measure the extent of the auroral oval, but the satellites pass the pole about 14 times a day and thus the picture can be couple of hours old.\\n\\nIf a major solar storm develops that is forecast to have a good chance of producing Northern (and Southern) Lights, your time to respond will be measured in hours to a few days, rather than either minutes or weeks. The particles that create the aurora move much more slowly than light, so a storm can be observed well before the particles it produces reach Earth, but the time difference is not enormous. The forecasts will usually include some indication of how far from the magnetic poles the activity is expected to extend.  For purposes of travel planning, it's a good idea to plan conservatively and go to a locale somewhat closer to the pole than the predicted maximum extent of the aurora; things don't always work out as forecast, and the Lights may be relatively weak and/or confined to the northern horizon if you're at the southern edge of the activity, either limitation possibly creating difficulties for you in viewing owing to light pollution.\\n\\n===Clothing===\\n[[File:St\\u00f8rmer and Birkeland Alta 1910.jpg|thumb|400px|Freezing photographers, Norway, 1910]]\\nBecause aurorae are usually visible at night in the colder months of the year, the observers tend to spend long hours in cold darkness. It is essential to  dress adequately to minimize the unpleasant side of the auroral experience, and almost impossible to dress too warmly.\\n\\nIn any area that gets severe winters, winter clothing will be widely available, but specialist shops catering to [[Skiing|skiers]], [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] or [[Wilderness backpacking|wilderness backpackers]] generally offer the best choice. Further south, these specialists may be the only places with winter equipment.\\n\\nIn remote northern locations where food, fuel and equipment have to be shipped in, ''prices on more-or-less everything can be very high''. Major northern cities tend to have better prices than more isolated areas, but still higher than in areas further south. Most travellers should buy much of their equipment before setting out; this gives more time for shopping, saves money, and avoids arriving in summer clothing when it is seriously cold outside.\\n\\nSome travellers should plan an extra stop for shopping; for example, going from Miami (where good winter gear is likely to be hard to find) to view the Lights in [[Churchill]] (where it is likely to be expensive and selection limited), one might stop in [[Chicago]], [[Toronto]] or [[Winnipeg]] to outfit oneself.\\n\\nFor specific information on winter clothing, see [[Cold weather#Clothing|Cold weather]]. Remember that you will have to use your fingers, so a combination of gloves and mittens can be useful.\\n\\n===Photography===\\n\\nTaking good pictures of the Northern Lights is '''very difficult''', since they're fast-moving, often faint and against a pitch-dark background, all of which befuddles consumer point-and-shoot cameras. Almost any [[Travel photography/Full systems|interchangeable lens camera]] can handle the job, given the right lens, but the typical \\\"kit lens\\\" sold with them will almost certainly not be fast enough and may not be wide enough either.\\n{{infobox|Lens focal lengths|In discussing focal length, we assume a 35mm film camera or \\\"full frame\\\" digital camera. For other types of camera, the actual numbers are different but the \\\"35mm equivalent\\\" is often quoted.}}\\nLong exposures are often required to capture faint lights. Here's what you need for a sporting chance:\\n\\n* A camera that supports '''manual exposure''' (5 to 40 seconds)\\n* A '''fast lens''' (aperture f/2.8 or better). Typically, a [[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|wide-angle lens]] is used to get a large area of sky.\\n* '''Fast film''' (800 ASA or better), or equivalent ISO setting on a digital camera\\n* A '''tripod''' to hold the long exposure\\n* '''Cable release or self-timer''' to trigger shots without stirring the camera\\n: Even better, for some cameras a '''remote control''' is available. Some cameras can use a wireless '''smartphone connection''' as remote control, but few smartphones are made for the conditions.\\n* '''Manual focus'''. It is not recommended to just focus your lens to infinity, instead it is best done by aiming at the Moon or a bright star (ideally in the live-view mode and using the maximum zoom).\\n* Multiple '''spare batteries and memory cards''': only having them will ensure they won't be needed. Keep the spares warm.\\n* What you don't need is the lens '''filter''': it can cause interference, so better take it off your lens.\\n[[File:Aurora shapes.jpg|thumb|405x405px|Images with Canon EOS 400D, ISO 1600, f/2.8, exposure 4s\\u201330s, 17mm (24 full frame).]]\\nWith a digital camera shooting in RAW format (or at least JPG + RAW) is a good idea: if something goes wrong in the field, there is more space for corrections in post-processing that way.\\n\\nAvoid breathing on the lens, the viewer or the display to prevent frosting them up. A light source such as a flashlight or headlamp can be useful when setting up the camera and tripod, and a smartphone is handy for alerts and forecasts. However, you need to get your eyes adjusted to darkness, so it is a good idea to limit use of these and set both phone and camera LCD displays to minimum brightness.\\n\\nThe ideal location has no light pollution, offers some shelter against wind, and is easily accessible. On a cold arctic night, you definitely want to avoid lugging camera and tripod a long distance or standing around in windy conditions waiting for the right shot. Moreover, wind tends to shake the camera, which is a problem in long exposures. A bigger, sturdier tripod helps with that, but is even worse to lug around.  If possible, do some scouting by day so you can go straight to a good location at night. It is not always possible to find a great location, but even a reasonable one can give better photos with less discomfort.\\n\\nAlso, try to get something interesting in the foreground; the [[#Europe|Norwegian photo below]] is a fine example. A shot of just the sky and some snow can be a bit boring even if the Lights are good.\\n\\nEither a zoom (variable focal length) or a prime (single focal length) lens can be used; each type has advantages. Zoom lenses are more flexible; you can adjust quickly for different sizes of light display. Primes are generally significantly faster than zooms, lighter and more compact; in many cases they also give a sharper picture than a zoom lens set to the same focal length.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora borealis over Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska.jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora borealis in [[Alaska]]]]<!-- image referenced in the text, check if you move or exchange it -->\\n\\n[[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|Wide-angle lenses]] are the commonest choice for photographing the lights. They give some distortion, even producing \\\"fish-eye\\\" images in extreme cases. The photo to the right was taken with a 16mm lens; the horizon appears curved and the trees in the foreground appear slightly off vertical, but some viewers would not notice this distortion and few would find it bothersome. The [[#Time_of_year|Scandinavian photo above]] used an even wider lens and has more distortion. A slightly longer lens, perhaps 24mm, would reduce the distortion but cover less of the sky. This is where zoom lenses have a significant advantage over primes; with, say, a 16\\u201335mm zoom you can adjust each shot to get the best trade-off between distortion and coverage. In other conditions, you might carry several primes and adjust by swapping lenses, but this is remarkably inconvenient in the field in an arctic night.\\n\\nA faster lens or a high-ISO camera setting can reduce exposure time, which is good. The photo to the right used an F2.8 lens and 25-second exposure. With F4, it would need 50 seconds, at or perhaps beyond the upper limit for practical shooting. An F1.4 lens would cut the time to around six seconds. This is quite likely to give a sharper photo because the lights move less during exposure, and it allows a bit more control over the shot; if you hit the shutter release when the sky looks particularly interesting, it is more likely to stay that way for a few seconds than over a longer time. This is where prime lenses have an advantage; they are often quite a bit faster than zooms. \\n\\nCombine a fast lens with a camera that allows high ISO settings and you might get exposure time down under a second, but it is not certain that this would give a better photo. High ISO settings give more noise in the image and you might lose more from that than you gain from the shorter time.\\n\\nFast wide lenses are expensive. Checking full-frame Canon lenses on an American vendor's site mid-2013, the cheapest lenses that might be suitable for shooting the Lights are a 40mm F2.8 at about $150 or 35/2.0 near $300; those are not wide enough to be ideal, but they would be usable and anything better is more expensive. More typical choices &mdash; for someone with a nice lens collection in hand or a good budget for building one &mdash; would be 20 or 24mm F2.8, 28/1.8, or the 17\\u201340 F4 zoom, in the $450 to $750 price range. The ideal choice might be either a 24/1.4 prime or 16\\u201335 F2.8 zoom, but these are high-end products mainly for professional photographers; either is around $1500. An ultra-wide 14mm F2.8 is a very good choice, and while those with auto-focus cost over $2000, some manual focus versions are available for a significantly lower price. Other brands have a different set of products and prices, but the overall pattern is similar. Companies other than the camera manufacturers also offer lenses, but again the pattern is similar.\\n\\nSee [[travel photography]] for more general discussion.\\n\\n==Locations==\\n[[File:Rovaniemi - Aurora Borealis.jpg|thumb|Aurora in [[Rovaniemi]], [[Finland]]]]\\nNorthern Lights usually form about 100 km (60 miles) above the surface of the earth. In principle, all areas under the Northern Lights oval are good observation points. However, most of these areas are remote and inaccessible, and suffer harsh climatic conditions.\\n\\nWhen selecting an observation site:\\n* If using a car, stay close to it. A typical car heater cannot actually keep a large metal vehicle warm when it is well below zero outside, but it is better than nothing and a car does provide shelter against wind. In really cold weather, leave the engine running even when you are away from the car, since the engine may have trouble starting again.\\n* Try finding accommodation in an area known to be good for viewing the Northern Lights. This may include a cottage, wilderness hut, a heated tent or similar shelter. This avoids long drives late at night to get to and from the viewing area.\\n* Avoid locations with light pollution; try to get away from populated areas. If this is not possible, try to have at least the northern view free of light pollution.\\n* Avoid steep hillsides or other major obstacles to the north.\\n\\nConsider bringing a tent or just a portable windbreak to provide some shelter from wind. Also vacuum flasks for hot beverages.\\n\\nViewing or photographing the Lights is an activity where hiring a local guide or paying for a tour is often worthwhile. A guide's local knowledge can help in several areas: coping with the weather, finding good sites, choosing good routes, and avoiding close encounters with [[dangerous wildlife]] such as polar bears or musk oxen. Also, a guide or tour company will have vehicles and other equipment suitable for the conditions. In remote areas it may not be possible to rent a vehicle or bring your own and, even if it is possible, it is not advisable unless both vehicle and driver are well prepared for [[winter driving]]. Some tours offer unusual transport options such as snowmobiles or sleds pulled by dogs, reindeer or horses; few tourists could safely drive those, and no owner of valuable animals is likely to allow a visitor to handle them unsupervised.\\n\\nVarious locations provide some kind of infrastructure, like tours, observation points etc. Here are lists of some major ones, in approximately west-to-east order:\\n\\n===North America===\\n{{seealso|Winter in North America}}\\n[[File:Flickr - DVIDSHUB - Alaska Aurora Borealis (Image 1 of 2).jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora in [[Alaska]]]]\\n*[[Fairbanks]], Alaska: famous for aurora viewing, with many tours and sites that cater to aurora watchers.\\n*[[Yellowknife]], in Canada's Northwest Territories, also with many tours\\n*[[Churchill]], on Hudson's Bay in Manitoba, is right smack dab in the center of the auroral belt, and offers the opportunity to see (lots of) polar bears on the same trip.\\n*[[Isle Royale National Park]], Upper Michigan, is a leave-no-trace park with no tours and few facilities. This is the best place in the 48 contiguous US sates to see the lights because it is quite far north and there is no light pollution.\\n\\n===North Atlantic islands===\\n\\n*[[Kangerlussuaq]], Greenland: very high chance of seeing the Lights from November to March. If dogsled or snowmobile rides are desired, mid-late winter is recommended.\\n*[[M\\u00fdvatn]], Iceland: offers the unique experience of observing aurorae while soaking in a natural geothermal bath. The capital, [[Reykjavik]], serves as a base for many tours.\\n*[[Berneray]], Outer Hebrides: this remote Scottish island offers suitable conditions for northern lights observation due to low light pollution.\\n\\n===Europe===\\n[[File:Aurora over Haja-3,2.jpg|thumb|Near Troms\\u00f8\\u200e, Norway]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\n{{Seealso|Winter in the Nordic countries}}\\n\\n* [[Abisko]], Northern Sweden. A popular place where the northern lights can be watched from the Aurora Sky Station at the top of the mountain Nuolja.\\n* [[Troms\\u00f8]], Northern Norway, is an easily accessible location with mild weather and numerous excursions. However the coastal location makes it susceptible to overcast conditions. Nearby [[Skibotn]] enjoys a dryer climate (very dry for Norway); this makes for better viewing opportunities. Another nearby location is [[Senja]] island.\\n* [[Alta]], also in Norway but further to the north-east and known for prehistoric rock carvings, is marketed also as a place to watch northern lights.\\n* [[Jukkasj\\u00e4rvi]], Northern Sweden, is the site of the original Ice Hotel, with excellent viewing infrastructure.\\n* [[Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi]], [[Inari]] and [[Utsjoki]] in Finnish Lapland all have quite dry weather and little light pollution.<!-- Nellim is another village which is far from light pollution. Add when there is an article.--> The ski resorts [[Saariselk\\u00e4]] in Inari and [[Levi]] in Kittil\\u00e4 have accommodation in glass igloos specially designed for enjoying the northern lights.\\n* The Kola Peninsula of [[Murmansk Oblast]] is Russia's most popular viewing spot.\\n\\nThe likelihood of seeing aurorae rapidly decreases when going south. In [[Helsinki]], aurorae occur about once a month, and are usually masked by light pollution or clouds. Aurorae seen further outside of the auroral belts may also be much less vivid, with fewer colours.\\n\\n=== Cruise ships ===\\nA luxurious way to see the lights is to take a [[cruise ship]] along the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Alaska]], or toward [[Antarctica]] for the Southern Lights, in the appropriate season. Cruises tend to be expensive, but the costs may be quite reasonable compared to flying to a good site on land and paying for accommodation and tours there. Viewing the Lights by just strolling on deck after dinner is much more convenient than being driven somewhere to stand in the snow, and the chance of encounters with dangerous wildlife is lower. \\n\\nThere may be problems with this; not all cruise lines run in winter and it is ''extremely'' difficult to get good photos from a moving ship when the subject requires long exposures, as the lights generally do. If the cruise is not specially for aurora viewing, chances are that light pollution from the ship itself is an issue.\\n\\n=== In flight ===\\nMany travelers in the northern latitudes find themselves treated to an aerial view of the lights. It's probably not realistic to ''plan'' to see them while on a plane, but if you find yourself taking frequent flights in upper latitudes, consider opting for a window seat on the northern side of the plane. If the show is good enough, the captain will usually make an announcement.\\n\\nIf you thought cruises on the seas were expensive, you probably won't be interested in heading up into '''[[space]]''', but orbital flight at around $35 million/person is a pretty surefire way to see the lights, both Northern and Southern, with zero light interference, and quite a grand view!\\n\\n== The ''Southern'' Lights ==\\n[[File:Aurora Australis Over the Tasman Sea from SouthWest National Park.jpg|thumb|Aurora Australis as seen at the remote New Harbour Beach in Tasmania's Southwest National Park]]\\nAurorae happen in an oval about the South Magnetic Pole just as they do about the North one, and the South Magnetic Pole is similarly offset from the geographic [[South Pole]]. Would-be observers of the '''Southern Lights''' or '''''Aurora Australis''''' benefit from the happy accident that the offset of the South Magnetic Pole is generally in the direction of [[Australia]], although the Pole itself is still in [[Antarctica]] like the geographic one. The southern parts of Australia and [[New Zealand]] get more than their share of Lights relative to their latitude.\\n\\nIn particular, [[Tasmania]] and the [[South Island]] of New Zealand are places where the Lights can be observed several times a year. If conditions are right, [[Hobart]] and [[Invercargill]] offer the best chance in places that are quickly accessible from within Australia and New Zealand.  Although [[Christchurch]] has a geographic latitude south of [[Hobart]], its \\\"geomagnetic latitude\\\" is further north, and aurora there are no more likely than southern [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. Check the space weather while you are travelling.\\n[[File:AuroraAustralisDisplay.jpg|thumb|Southern Lights seen from [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]]]\\n\\nAll these locations are still outside the auroral belt itself, so the odds of catching the lights during your trip there are not good. Because of the skew towards the Eastern Hemisphere, it is not reasonable to expect any viewing from [[Patagonia]], and it's not that likely you'll see them even from the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The best place to view them would be Antarctica's [[Ross Sea]] via [[Macquarie Island]] (Australia) or the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]]. The best viewing would be from the boat itself. The closest island to the auroral belt that has a good range of tourist accommodation is [[Stewart Island]]. \\n\\nThere is day trip flight from [[Sydney]] to see the Southern Lights (A$1,295+).\\n\\nAll of the considerations about maximizing your chances of seeing the Northern Lights apply equally to seeing the Southern Lights, except that the Southern Hemisphere seasons should be taken into account in regards to maximizing the hours of darkness.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Astronomy]]\\n* [[Midnight sun]] \\u2014 at latitudes where there's dark all day in the winter and people travel to see the Northern Lights, there's usually light all night in the summer.\\n{{PartOfTopic|Natural attractions|the Arctic}}\\n{{guidetopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner |Australia alt banner.jpg| caption=Kata Tjuta in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Northern Territory|origin=0.3,0}}\\n\\nThere is nowhere else quite like '''Australia''', nicknamed the ''Land Down Under'', the only country that has a whole continent to itself.

A G20 member, it has high quality of life and is constantly ranked among the world's most livable countries. It is a significant player in the economic and political spheres of the Indo-Pacific region.\\n===History===\\n{{see also|Indigenous Australian culture|British Empire|Australian Convict Sites}}\\n\\nAboriginal people have been living in Australia for at least 65,000 years. They arrived in successive waves from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. With rising sea levels after the last Ice Age, Australia became largely isolated from the rest of the world and the Aboriginal groups developed a variety of cultures, based on a close spiritual relationship with the land and nature, and extended kinship. For thousands of years Australian Aboriginal people maintained a hunter-gatherer culture, or (in some areas) a semi-sedentary culture, in association with a complex artistic and cultural life, including a very rich tradition of story and song.\\n\\nThe modern impression of Australian Aboriginal people is largely built around an image of the \\\"desert people\\\" who have adapted to some of the harshest conditions on the planet (equivalent to the bushmen of the Kalahari), but many others lived in forested and well-watered regions. Australia provided a comfortable living for the bulk of the Aboriginal people among the bountiful flora and fauna on the Australian coast \\u2013 until the arrival of Europeans.\\n\\nAlthough a lucrative [[China|Chinese]] market for shells and ''b\\u00eache de mer'' (sea cucumber) had encouraged Indonesian fishermen to visit the \\nnorth coasts of Australia for centuries, it was unknown to Europeans until the 1600s, when [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] traders to Asia began to \\\"bump\\\" into the northwestern coast. The Makassan contact from [[Sulawesi]] also brought many Indonesian cultural elements to the Indigenous people of the north, making Islam the first foreign religion brought in \\u2013 and quite a few rock artworks seen in Arnhem Land and the Kimberley depict many Islamic elements.\\n\\nEarly Dutch impressions of this extremely harsh, dry country were unfavourable, and Australia remained for them somewhat of a marker sign pointing north to the much richer (and more lucrative) East Indies (modern day Indonesia). Deliberate exploration of the Australian coast was then largely taken over by the French and the British. Consequently, place names of bays, headlands and rivers around the coastline reflect a range of Dutch, French, or English names, however many place names are also from Aboriginal languages with places that were previously having Dutch, French, or English names renamed to Indigenous names, or dual named.\\n\\nIn 1770, the expedition of the Endeavour under the command of [[Voyages of James Cook|Captain James Cook]] navigated and charted the east coast of Australia, making first landfall at [[Sydney/St George and Sutherland Shire#History|Botany Bay]] on 29 April 1770. Cook continued northwards, and before going ashore on [[Possession Island]] in the Torres Strait off Cape York on 22 August 1770. Here he formally claimed the eastern coastline he had explored for the British Crown, naming it New South Wales. Given that Cook's so-called discoveries would lead to the first European settlement of Australia, he is often popularly conceived as its European discoverer, although he had been preceded by more than 160 years by the Dutch.\\n[[File:PortArthurPenitentiary.jpg|thumb|Part of the former [[Port Arthur (Tasmania)|Port Arthur]] convict settlement in Tasmania. The remains of the settlement form part of the [[Australian Convict Sites]] entry on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].]]\\n\\nFollowing the exploration period, the first British settlement in Australia was founded in 1788 at what is today [[Sydney]], led by Captain Arthur Philip who became the first governor of the colony of New South Wales. The process of colonisation led to conflict with indigenous Australians as well as diseases to which they had no immunity. Their populations declined throughout much (though not all) of the land, and they were displaced by British settlers. Originally comprising the eastern two-thirds of the continent, the colony of New South Wales was later split into several separate colonies. [[Tasmania]] (then known as Van Diemen's Land) became a separate colony in 1825, which was followed by [[South Australia]] in 1836, [[New Zealand]] in 1841, [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]] in 1851 and [[Queensland]] in 1859. The western third of the continent was not settled by Europeans until the British established a naval base in [[Albany (Western Australia)|Albany]], then known as King George Sound in 1826. The Swan River Colony was formally established in 1829 at what is today [[Perth]]. The Swan River Colony was renamed \\\"[[Western Australia]]\\\" in 1832.\\n\\nWhile Australia began its modern history as a British penal colony, the most people who came to Australia after 1788 were free settlers, mainly from Britain and [[Ireland]], and to a less extent other European countries such as France and what is now Germany. Convict settlements were mostly along the east coast, with scattered pockets of convict settlements in Western Australia. The state of South Australia, on the other hand, was settled entirely by free settlers. Many Asian and Eastern European people also came to Australia in the 1850s, during the Gold Rush that started Australia's first resource boom. Although such diverse immigration diminished greatly during the xenophobic years of the White Australia policy, from the Postwar Period Australia welcomed a successive series of immigration from continental Europe, the Mediterranean and later Asia and the rest of the world, becoming a highly diverse and multicultural society by the late 20th century.\\n\\nThe system of separate colonies federated to form the self-governing British dominion of Australia in 1901, each colony now becoming a state of Australia, with New Zealand opting out of the federation. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and despite its small population it made a notable contribution to the Allied war effort in [[World War I]] and [[World War II in Europe]] as part of the British Commonwealth forces. Australia was directly attacked in the [[Pacific War]]. Australian troops also made a valuable, if sometimes controversial, contribution to the [[Korean War]], the [[Indochina Wars|Vietnam War]], and the wars on Iraq and in Afghanistan around the turn of millennium. Australian Diggers retain a reputation as some of the hardest fighting troops along with a great social spirit.\\n\\nAustralia and Britain passed the Australia Act in 1986, ending any remnant power the British parliament may have had to pass laws for Australia. Similar to Canada, the British King remains as the head of state with an (Australian) appointed Governor-General as his representative in Australia.\\n\\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, there was growth in Aboriginal activism, accompanied by a greater willingness by the general community to acknowledge both the Indigenous cultural heritage (particularly in the visual arts) and the darker side of colonial history. Significant areas of the country have been returned to Indigenous ownership as a result of the land rights movement. In 2008, then-prime minister Kevin Rudd delivered an official apology to the Aboriginal people in Parliament for the atrocities committed against them by the white majority. An Aboriginal ceremony has also been incorporated into Australia's State Opening of Parliament since 2008 as homage to its indigenous heritage.\\n\\n===Geography===\\n{{infobox|Does Australia border two oceans, or three?|The number of oceans that Australia borders, is a little bit of an ambiguous one. The Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean boundaries are fairly unambiguous, but the third one, the Southern Ocean is. In most international contexts, the Southern Ocean begins only south of the 60\\u00b0S point, but in Australia (including in government), the Southern Ocean begins at Australia's southern coastline, but at the 60\\u00b0 everywhere else. On most Australian maps, you will see \\\"Southern Ocean\\\" marked, particularly on South Australian diving maps and so unless otherwise indicated, the Southern Ocean on Wikivoyage's Australian articles follow the Australian context, not the international definition.}}\\n[[File:Macropus rufus 01 - Christopher Watson.jpg|thumbnail|Red kangaroos in the Northern Territory]]\\nThe landmass of Australia is both the world's smallest continent and the world's largest island; making up most of [[Oceania]]'s land area.\\n\\nThe nation of Australia includes the Australian mainland, and some smaller islands (such as [[Tasmania]]). It is the world's sixth largest country, with a land area of 7,682,300 km<sup>2</sup> (2,966,152 square miles). It is comparable in size to the 48 contiguous [[United States]] (which has an area of 7,663,941.7 km<sup>2</sup>) although it has less than one tenth the population, with the distances between cities and towns easy to underestimate. Australia is bordered to the west by the Indian Ocean, to the south by the Southern Ocean, and to the east by the Pacific Ocean. The Tasman Sea lies to the southeast, separating it from [[New Zealand]], while the Coral Sea lies to the northeast. [[Papua New Guinea]], [[East Timor]] and [[Indonesia]] are Australia's northern neighbours, all much closer than New Zealand, and are separated from Australia by the Arafura Sea and the Timor Sea with Papua New Guinea only being {{km|4}} away from Australia.\\n\\nAustralia is highly urbanised with most of the population heavily concentrated along the eastern and southeastern coasts. Most of the inland areas of the country are semi-arid. The most populous states are [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]], but the largest in terms of area is [[Western Australia]].\\n\\nLarge parts of Australia have been deforested to make way for agriculture but many native forest areas survive in extensive [[National parks in Australia|national parks]] and other undeveloped areas. Long term environmental concerns in Australia include water management, salinity, pollution, threats to biodiversity from invasive species, and conserving coastal areas, especially the Great Barrier Reef.\\n\\n===Climate===\\nAs a large country, Australia has a wide variety of climates. Most of the country receives more than 3,000 hours of sunshine a year. Generally, the north is hot and tropical, while the south tends to sub-tropical and temperate. Most rainfall is around the coast, and much of the centre is '''arid''' and '''semi-arid'''. The daytime maximum temperatures in the tropical city of [[Darwin]] rarely drop below 30\\u00b0C (86\\u00b0F) even in winter, while night temperatures in winter usually hover around 15\\u201320\\u00b0C (60\\u201370\\u00b0F). Australian winters tend to be milder than those at similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere, and snow never falls in most parts of the country. Temperatures in high-altitude areas of some southern regions can drop below freezing in winter (and sometimes even in the summer) and the [[Snowy Mountains]] in the southeast experience metres of winter snow. In the central and western mountainous parts of [[Tasmania]], snowfall is very common.\\n\\nAs Australia is in the southern hemisphere, June\\u2013August is winter while December\\u2013February is summer. The dry season is in winter in the tropics and in summer in the south beyond the [[Great Dividing Range]]. Rainfall is more evenly distributed throughout the year in the southern parts of the East Coast.\\n\\nIf you are from the Northern Hemisphere, note the implications on cardinal directions: the sun (and stars) move anti-clockwise over here, and it's the northern slopes that get most sun. While this may be confusing any time, during hikes or off-piste activities your intuition may lead you to make critical mistakes. Double check how you are drawing your conclusions.\\n\\n===Economy===\\nAustralia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per capita GDP on par with other advanced economies.\\n\\nThe service industries, including tourism, education, and financial services, account for just over half of the Australian Gross Domestic Product \\u2013 about 60%. Within the service sector, tourism is one of the most important industries in Australia, as it provides employment, contributes $73 billion to the economy each year and accounts for at least 11% of total exports.\\n\\nPrimary industry - mining and agriculture - has accounted for most of Australia's exports in the 20th and 21st centuries. Iron ore and coal are by far the largest exports, along with wheat, beef and wool. The mining sector is sensitive to global demand for iron ore, with events in the Chinese and Indian economies having direct impacts.\\n\\nAustralia has a comprehensive social security system, and the minimum wage is higher than the United States or the United Kingdom. Manual labourers and tradesmen are well-paid in Australia, often more so than white-collar professionals.\\n\\n===Politics===\\n[[File:Parliament House Canberra 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Parliament House in Canberra]]\\nAustralia has a federal system of government, with six state and two territory governments, as well as a national government. It also has several external territories in the surrounding oceans, which are given considerable autonomy, and often not fully integrated with the rest of Australia. Laws vary slightly from state to state, but are for the most part fairly uniform.\\n\\nThe national parliament is based on the British Westminster system, with some elements being drawn from the American congressional system. At the federal level it consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives. Each Member of the House of Representatives (colloquially known as a Member of Parliament (MP)) represents an electoral division, with more populous states having more electoral divisions and hence, more MPs. On the other hand, similar to the US Senate, each Australian state has an equal number of senators, with 12 senators being directly elected by the people in each state, and 2 senators each from the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory. The Prime Minister is head of the national government, and is the leader of the political party (or coalition of parties) which has the most Members in the House of Representatives.\\n\\nKing Charles III of the United Kingdom is also King of Australia and the head of state, and is represented in Australia at the federal level by the Governor-General. The roles of the King and Governor-General are largely ceremonial, and the Prime Minister wields the most authority in government. A referendum to change Australia to a republic was defeated in 1999, but it failed as the proposal allowed the president to be dismissible by the PM, even though there was general support for a republican Australia. Republicanism in Australia remains a regular conversation point, albeit low on the list of real priorities.\\n\\nThe Cabinet of Australia serves as the executive branch, and is headed by the Prime Minister, who appoints his ministers from among the members of both houses of Parliament. The judicial branch is topped by the High Court of Australia, which replaced the UK Privy Council as the highest court of appeal in 1986.\\n\\nState and territory governments are organised similarly to the national government with a state parliament serving as the legislature, a Premier (Chief Minister in the territories) serving as the head of the state government, and its own judiciary. There is also a Governor for each state serving as the King's representative in a mostly ceremonial role.\\n\\nThe two major political parties in Australia are the Australian Labor Party (ALP or just \\\"Labor\\\") and the Liberal Party (Australian slang: ''The Libs''), which operates in coalition with the National Party (referred to as the \\\"Coalition\\\"). There are smaller parties such as the Greens and Teal Independents. \\n\\nThe centre-left Labor Party spells its name \\\"Labor\\\" instead of \\\"Labour\\\" because of the American labor movement. The Greens are considered further to the left than Labor and the two parties do not work closely together.\\n\\nThe Liberal Party is a centre-right conservative party, with the term \\\"liberal\\\" referring to a free market economy. As the word \\u2018Liberal\\u2019 in Australia is associated with the Liberal Party, \\u2018liberalism\\u2019 and \\u2018liberal politics\\u2019 are associated with right leaning politics unlike in other English-speaking countries. They coordinate closely with the National Party, who represent rural electorates and have a more conservative outlook whilst being largely against environmental protections. Since the late 2010s, the Liberal Party has  been challenged by the Teal Independents, a loose grouping of MPs who represent mainly affluent urban areas, and who have been dissatisfied by the increasingly weak environmental position of the Liberals.\\n\\n===Culture===\\n\\nAustralia has a multicultural population practising almost every religion and lifestyle. Over one-quarter of Australians were born outside Australia, and another quarter have at least one foreign-born parent. Virtually every large Australian city and town reflects the immigration from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the Pacific that occurred after World War II and continued into the 1970s. In the half century after the war Australia's population boomed from roughly 7 million to just over 20 million people. The cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth are culturally very diverse, and home to communities originating from all corners of the globe. Despite this diversity, there exists a strong sense of national identity and pride in the things that are uniquely Australian.\\n\\nIn all major centres, you will find restaurants offering a variety of global foods. Each city has something different to offer; Sydney promotes itself as an urban nature capital; Melbourne, as a centre for the arts and culture; Brisbane, as a collection of multicultural urban villages. Adelaide is known for festivals, wine culture, and German cultural influences; Perth for its beaches, laid-back vibe, and the international fringe arts festival; and finally Hobart for its history, including its humble beginnings as a penal colony. Smaller rural settlements generally still reflect a majority Anglo-Celtic culture often with a small indigenous population. Most rural centres welcome visitors and have both history and local produce to share.\\n[[File:Melbournes Chinatown (6760134067).jpg|thumb|Melbourne's Chinatown]]\\n\\nAround one million Australians identify as Aboriginal; about 4% of the population. They live throughout the country in cities and in rural Aboriginal communities. Although not particularly obvious to a new visitor, there are many opportunities and cultural activities for people wanting to explore Aboriginal culture.\\n\\nContrary to popular mythology, descendants from the original fleets of British convicts are a minority. Even during the years of transportation, free settlers outnumbered convict migrants by at least five to one; some places like South Australia nominally<!--there may have been convicts who may have moved as free settlers--> had zero convicts. Nevertheless, it is seen as a badge of honour for someone to be 'Australian Royalty' in having been descended from a convict, however tenuous that connection may be.\\n\\nAustralians can be more socially conservative than some European cultures, but tend to be relaxed in their religious observance. Modes of address are casual and familiar. Most Australians will address you by your first name from first contact, and will expect you to do the same to them.\\n\\n====Holidays====\\n[[File:Lotto Skyworks Applecross.jpg|thumb|250px|Fireworks over Perth to mark Australia Day]]\\nThe national holidays in Australia are:\\n* '''1 January''': New Year's Day\\n* '''26 January''': Australia Day, marking the anniversary of the First Fleet's landing in Sydney Cove in 1788.\\n* '''Easter weekend''' (Good Friday through Easter Monday): a four-day long weekend in March or April set according to the Western Christian dates. Very few go to church, but instead many Australians travel on Easter weekend, so expect hotel rooms and airtickets to sell out months in advance.\\n* '''25 April''': ANZAC Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps), honouring military veterans\\n* '''Second Monday in June''': King's birthday holiday (celebrated in Western Australia in September, with WA observing '''Western Australia Day''' a week earlier)\\n* '''25 December''': Christmas Day\\n* '''26 December''': Boxing Day\\n\\nMany states observe '''Labour Day''', but on different days. Most states have one or two additional statewide holidays, with [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]] having a day off for a horse race (The Melbourne Cup and The Adelaide Cup). Western Australia has Western Australia Day typically the first Monday in June (recognising the founding of the state since 1829) but also celebrates the Queen's Birthday at a different date to the rest of the country, either at the end of September or early October, due to the proximity of the usual June date to Western Australia Day. Victoria also has a day off for the AFL grand final Friday.\\n\\nWhen a public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the following Monday (and Tuesday if necessary) are usually declared holidays in lieu, although the celebrations and the retail closures will occur on the day itself. Most tourist attractions are closed Christmas Day and Good Friday. Supermarkets and other stores may open for limited hours on some public holidays and on holidays in lieu but are almost always closed on Christmas Day (25 December), Good Friday, Easter Sunday and ANZAC Day morning.\\n\\n'''Australia Day''' remains a national point of controversy. It is termed 'invasion day' by many people of indigenous heritage and a growing number of progressives, who believe it is insensitive to celebrate the beginning of British invasion and occupation. Calls to change the date are marked by yearly protests. You will see plenty of Australia Day celebrations and barbecues as well, often hosted by local governments.\\n\\nOther than official holidays, there are also days of national or regional cultural significance that might as well be holidays such as:\\n\\n* '''AFL Grand Final''': The championship game of the Australian Football League, and the most watched event perennially on the Australia sporting calendar, especially in Victoria. Expects all pubs to be packed full of people watching the game, while many people will hold big watching parties in their homes. Held on the last Saturday of September or first Saturday of October.\\n* '''NRL Grand Final''': The championship game of the National Rugby League. Particularly popular in Queensland and New South Wales. Usually held on the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October.\\n\\n===Peak holiday times===\\nMost attractions in Australia remain open year-round, some operating at a reduced frequency or shorter hours during the off-peak season. Many attractions (but not all) are closed on Christmas and New Year's Day.\\n\\n'''Summer school holidays''' start before Christmas and last the whole of January, and it is considered the busiest and most expensive time to visit (unless you're visiting [[Northern Australia]]). Holiday homes on beaches are often booked out months in advance as well as charging a significant premium. The long '''Easter weekend''' can also be busy as parents take their kids out for a last time before Winter arrives.\\n\\nAustralian teenagers celebrate the end of school at the end of November and early December for the 3 weeks known as ''schoolies''. The volume of teen revellers can completely change the nature of some of the cities and towns they choose to visit, especially coastal towns like [[Byron Bay]] in New South Wales, the [[Gold Coast]] in Queensland, [[Rottnest Island]] in Western Australia, [[Victor Harbor]] in South Australia and various localities along the [[Mornington Peninsula]] in Victoria.\\n\\n===Time===\\n[[File:Central time zone sign.jpg|thumb|200px|A road sign near Broken Hill noting the time zone difference]]\\nAustralia can have up to seven different time zones during the daylight savings period, and five at other times. Time zone boundaries do not always follow state boundaries. For instance, the towns of [[Broken Hill]] and Silverton, although in New South Wales, follows South Australia time, Lord Howe Island has its own time zone despite being a part of New South Wales and a number of outback communities officially follow NT time.\\n[[File:Australia-states-timezones.svg|thumbnail|Time zones in Australia from GMT]]\\nIn the east, Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria always have the same time. [[Queensland]] doesn't observe daylight saving, so it is an hour behind the other eastern states during that period.\\n\\nIn the centre, Broken Hill and Silverton (NSW), South Australia and the [[Northern Territory]] are half an hour behind during the winter, but the Northern Territory doesn't observe daylight saving while South Australia, Broken Hill and Silverton do. During daylight saving South Australia remains half an hour behind New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, but moves half an hour ahead of Queensland. The Northern Territory remains half an hour behind Queensland at all times of the year, but moves an hour and a half behind New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania during daylight savings.\\n\\nIn the west, Western Australia is two hours behind the eastern states in winter, and also doesn't observe daylight saving. It moves three hours behind the eastern states that observe daylight saving (remaining two hours behind Queensland), 2.5 hours behind South Australia, Broken Hill and Silverton while remaining 1.5 hours behind the Northern Territory.\\n\\nThere is also the unusual +8:45 time zone, also known as Australian Central West Standard Time (ACWST or CWST) followed in some towns near the South Australian/Western Australian border. While not an official time used, it's the de facto time zone. There are also highway signs telling you to change your clocks, and Apple has a separate region (which can be found under \\\"Eucla\\\"). What makes this case even more confusing, is that the only South Australian town in the CWST zone, Border Village, follows daylight savings, follows +9:45, one hour ahead of Eucla, and 45 minutes behind the rest of SA. On the contrary, the chances of being impacted on Border Village is next to zero given that all commercial activity is on the WA side in the town of Eucla which follows UTC+8:45.\\n\\nAlthough the chances of a traveller going to the extremely remote Outback WA towns of Blackstone, Irrunytju, Warakurna, Wanarn, Kiwirrkurra, and Tjukurla are very low, whilst all of these towns are in WA, they follow ACST (NT time), 1.5 hours ahead of the rest of WA, and since the NT does not follow DST, these remote towns also don't follow DST.\\n\\nThere are no official abbreviations or names for Australian time zones, and you may see a few variations used. EST, CST, WST along with EDT, CDT are sometimes used. Sometimes AEST, etc., with the 'A' prefix distinguishing them from the North American time zones with the same names. <!-- In conversation, the abbreviations aren't used. People tend to say ''Sydney time'', ''Brisbane time'', or ''Perth time''. Expect blank stares from most if you start talking about ''Central Summer Time''. -->\\n\\nIn those states which observe daylight saving, it commences on the first Sunday in October and ends on the first Sunday in April.\\n\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\"\\n|-\\n!

Unlike [[Australian slang]], these are also used in formal conversations, on the TV and even in government.

Australian English as generally spoken is distinctive in accent and idiom. It mostly developed from the speech of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, however, the 20th century brought a lot of American influence, giving Australia its own unique variety of English.\\n\\nNevertheless, as Australia is a global melting pot, particularly in the major cities, you will encounter cultures and hear languages from all around the world, and you will often find areas and suburbs that predominately reflect the language of their respective immigrant communities. Foreign languages are taught at school, but students rarely progress past the basics.\\n\\nAustralia follows mostly British spelling and an eclectic mix of American and British terminology, such as ''eggplant'' (not aubergine), ''boot'' (not trunk), ''toll-free'' (not freephone), ''take-away'' (not takeout) and ''truck'' (not lorry). American terminology is understood everywhere, while British terminology isn't well understood apart from South Australia and the elderly. In all that, some terminology is uniquely Australian, and is unlikely to be heard anywhere else, except maybe in neighbouring New Zealand.\\n\\nA few words also have different meanings in Australia. For example, \\\"thongs\\\" in Australia would refer to flip-flops, ''not'' underwear.  \\\"Chips\\\" can, confusingly, refer to ''both'' US \\\"fries\\\" and UK \\\"crisps\\\"; you can usually work it out from context, or say \\\"hot chips\\\" if you mean freshly deep fried potatoes.  \\\"Fries\\\" is understood as well though, and is not uncommon particularly for American-style shoestring fries.\\n\\nPeople in rural areas may have a broader accent, using some of the slang words that have become outmoded in metropolitan areas, while highly educated urban dwellers sometimes use a cultivated accent similar to that of their British equivalents. Try to resist the temptation to use [[Australian slang]] yourself: it's easy to get it wrong and sound patronizing.\\n\\nThere is little regional variation in Australian English, although accents tend to be broader outside of the large cities, and the pronunciation of certain words like \\\"dance\\\" and \\\"renaissance\\\" varies between regions. Most regional differences come down to word usage. For example, swimming clothes are known as ''cossies'' or ''swimmers'' in New South Wales, ''togs'' in Queensland, and'' bathers'' elsewhere. Many indigenous communities around Australia and the [[Torres Strait Islands]] speak English as a second language.\\n\\n[[File:Multilingual road safety sign (3565389671).jpg|thumb|left|200px|A multilingual road sign in German, Italian, Japanese and Pitjantjatjara. Quite an unusual sight for Australia.]]\\n\\nIt is rare to find signs in a second language, except in urban areas with a high population of Asian immigrants and students, where signs and restaurant menus in [[Vietnamese phrasebook|Vietnamese]] and [[Chinese phrasebook|Chinese]] are a common sight; and also around [[Cairns]] and the [[Gold Coast]] in Queensland where some signs (but not road signs) are written in [[Japanese phrasebook|Japanese]] or Chinese, due to the large number of tourists. Some warning signs at beaches are written in several foreign languages.\\n\\nVisitors who do not speak basic English will find communicating with Australians difficult, and should do some advance planning. Some tour companies specialise in offering package deals for Australian tours complete with language guides, but mostly in Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, German, Italian, French, Indonesian and Korean. Some tours also give tours in Spanish, Malay and Portuguese, although this isn't as common. Only a very small minority of tours give tours in Hindi, Arabic and Swahili, and finding one of these is once in a blue moon.\\n\\n'''Indigenous''' languages play an important part in recognising Australia's long Indigenous heritage, but common usage is sadly low, with only 46 left spoken day to day by 42,300 people. You are most likely to encounter these languages in rural outback communities and in the Torres Strait Islands. Although there are initiatives to revive the Indigenous languages, it has proven to be a challenge because of the sheer number of languages that are widely spread out and not mutually intelligible. Learning an Indigenous language will be useful only in specific local areas. Almost all Indigenous Australians speak English as well, although residents of some remote communities may not be fluent in the language. On top of the Indigenous languages spoken, various creole-based languages are spoken such as [[Australian Kriol phrasebook|Australian Kriol]] or [[Torres Strait Creole phrasebook|Torres Strait Creole]].\\n\\nThe standard sign language is '''Auslan''' (standing for Australian Sign Language). When a sign interpreter is present for a public event, he or she will use Auslan. Users of British and New Zealand Sign Languages will be able to understand much, though not all, of the language. Auslan and NZSL are largely derived from BSL, and all three languages use the same two-handed manual alphabet. Users of sign languages that have different origins (such as the French Sign Language family, which also includes American and Irish Sign Languages) will not be able to understand Auslan.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[File:Visa policy of Australia.svg|thumb|450px|\\n{{legend|#ED1C24|Australia}}\\n{{legend|#1191E5|Special Category Visa}}\\n{{legend|#22B14C|eVisitor or Electronic Travel Authority}}\\n{{legend|#79D343|eVisitor}}\\n{{legend|#B5E61D|Electronic Travel Authority}}\\n{{legend|#C0C0C0|Visa required}}\\n]]\\n===Entry requirements===\\n\\n'''Everybody''' (except New Zealanders)  requires a [[visa]] in advance of travel.\\n\\nIf you are visiting for a holiday of less than 90 days, there are three types of visas you may apply for, depending on your nationality.\\n\\n* '''[https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/electronic-travel-authority-601 Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) subclass 601]''' is available to nationals of many countries, and you must apply using the Australian ETA app with a service fee of $20. It is valid for 12 months. \\n* '''[https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/evisitor-651 eVisitor (subclass 651)]''' is for citizens of the [[European Union]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]] and a few [[European microstates]]. These visas are '''free''', but otherwise effectively identical to the ETA. You must apply online.\\n* '''Visitor Visa (subclass 600)'''. Citizens of most other countries can make an application online by creating an [https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/applying-online-or-on-paper/online ImmiAccount]; some may need to visit an embassy or visa processing centre as part of the process.\\n:: Like the ETA and eVisitor, a Visitor 600 is by default issued for a three month stay. Unlike the other options however, a 600 visa ''can'' be issued for a longer stay of up to one year. For more than a three month stay, you will likely be asked for supporting documentation about the reason for your visit and your ties to your country of origin and may need to attend an interview. Depending on your nationality, the embassy or visa processing centre may also require you to have an Australian sponsor before issuing the visa. The fee is $190. ETAs and eVisitors are valid for multiple entries within a 12-month period. If you're eligible for either, it may be easier to stay the three months you're allowed, go to [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] or some other country reachable by a low cost airline for a few days and come back - restarting the 90-day clock.

Check the [https://interstatequarantine.org.au/ Australian Interstate Quarantine] website for details.\\n\\n===By car===\\n{{See also|Driving in Australia|Australia without a car}}\\n\\n[[File:Great Ocean Road, Lorne, Australia - Feb 2012.jpg|thumb|The Great Ocean Road]]\\n[[File:Stuart Highway, Australia.jpg|thumb|Part of the Stuart Highway in Central Australia]]\\n\\nAustralia has a generally well-maintained system of roads and highways, and cars are a commonly used method of transport. While public transportation is fairly reliable in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and SE Queensland, having a car is preferable, or in some cases essential, to get around anywhere else. All the mainland state capitals are linked to each other by good undivided highways. Some parts are divided highways but many sections are one lane each way with occasional overtaking lanes around every 5-20 km depending on the state. Roads linking minor centres (or what can look like short-cuts on the map) can be narrow or gravel roads and are generally slower. Australia's low population density and large size makes for long driving times between major centres.\\n\\nIn general, unlike Europe, South Africa or the U.S., there are no freeways connecting major centres. Divided dual carriageways that link major centres don't go for very long, and you could get roundabouts or traffic lights at random areas with only 1 km notice. While Sydney to Melbourne can be fully achieved on divided dual carriageways, particularly in the NSW section, there are plenty of flat junctions. Sydney to Brisbane can also be achieved on 99% divided dual carriageways/motorways, with plans to build the remaining one percent as a freeway (expected to be completed by 2027), but the remaining section traverses through the busy centres of Heatherbrae and Coffs Harbour. Other routes like Melbourne to Adelaide are only partial divided freeways (approximately 250 km/750 km \\u2013 about a third of the route), but yet there's still towns to be bypassed, and there is only a very short freeway/dual carriageway section in South Australia.\\n\\nDrives like Sydney to Perth or Adelaide to Darwin would be much better off achieved by a plane, and journeying here often takes around half a week, and these are routes that Australians themselves only do about once or twice in their lifetime. Distances are huge, and if you put it onto a European perspective: is the distance between Madrid and Moscow, and on a North American perspective, the distance from Miami to Los Angeles.\\n\\nMajor hazards on Australian roads are wildlife and large trucks. Be sure to take extra care when driving at dusk or in the dark, as the risk of animal collisions increases significantly. Major regional areas have paved (sealed) dual-lane roads, but isolated areas may have poorly maintained dirt roads or even tracks. Distances and speeds are specified in kilometres and fuel is sold by the litre. There are no tolls on roads or bridges outside of the urban areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Toowoomba.\\n\\nAustralia drives on the left. Overseas visitors who are used to driving on the right should take care when they first drive, and again when they are driving on country roads with little traffic.\\n\\nGenerally, overseas licenses are valid for driving in Australia for three months after arrival. If the licence is not in English, an International Driving Permit (IDP) is required in addition to your licence. Licensing regulations and road rules vary slightly from state to state.\\n\\nThe default speed limit in most of Australia is 50 km/h in built-up areas, and 100 km/h on rural roads, unless signed otherwise except in the NT where urban defaults are 60 km/h, and in WA and the NT, rural defaults are 110 km/h. Many major rural roads have a posted speed limit of 110 km/h especially in the Outback. Average speed is seldom above 80 km/h due to the poor road conditions and limited overtaking opportunities. On some national highways that traverse mountain ranges and travel through small towns, even averaging 60&nbsp;km/h can be a challenge. Speed limits are strictly enforced in Australia, and even creeping ever so slightly above the speed limit could earn you a ticket with a hefty fine.\\n\\nWhile major highways are well serviced, anyone '''leaving well-maintained roads''' in inland Australia should take advice from local authorities, check weather and road conditions, and carry sufficient spare fuel, spare parts, spare tyres, matches, food and water. Some remote roads might see one car per month or less.\\n\\nCellular coverage is non-existent outside of national highways and towns and you should take some precautions in case of emergency.\\n\\nHeat and dehydration at any time of year can kill. If stranded, stay with your vehicle and do what you can to improve your visibility from the air. Do not take this advice lightly; every year locals and tourists die from dehydration after their car breaks down in a remote area. If you do have to abandon your car (say you break down and then get a lift), call the local police station, to avoid a search being started for you.\\n\\n====Car rental====\\nMajor cities around Australia have multiple outlets providing a wide range of rental vehicles from major international rental companies.

The East Coast from Sydney to Cairns is especially abundant with these vehicles. [[Driving in Australia]] has more information on renting or buying a campervan.\\n\\nIt is sometimes possible to book a campervan needing '''relocation''' from one town to another for a nominal fee of as low as $1 per day.

Services along the main business travel corridor (Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane) are run almost like a bus service, with flights leaving every 15 minutes during the day.\\n\\nThe best fares are almost always available on the most competitive routes, whereas routes to remote destinations with fewer flights tend to be more expensive.

There are numerous options to charter aircraft that may take you direct to smaller country towns or even offshore islands. The costs can be comparable to scheduled airlines if there are 3 or more people flying in a group. The Australian Private Pilots Licence permits private pilots to carry passengers and to recover the cost of the plane hire and fuel from passengers, but not to advertise for passengers or fly commercially. That said, if you check the web pages of local flying clubs, there are always private pilots willing to fly on a fine weekend if someone is willing to put in for the cost of the plane and fuel.\\n\\n===By train===\\n{{see also|Rail travel in Australia|Across Australia by train}}\\n\\n[[File:Passenger rail services in Australia en.png|thumb|upright=2.1|Map of the main inter-city rail lines in Australia]]\\n\\nTrains are rarely a practical means of long-distance transport in Australia: they tend to be slower than driving, more expensive than flying and run less frequently than buses. A historical lack of cooperation between the states, combined with sheer distances and a relatively small population to service, have left Australia with a national rail network that is relatively slow and used mainly for freight. Nevertheless, train travel between cities can be very scenic and present opportunities to see new aspects of the country. It can also be a cost-effective way to get to some smaller towns, which tend to have more expensive flights than those between the state capitals.\\n\\nMost long-distance rail services that exist link the regional townships with the state capital, such as [[Bendigo]] to Melbourne, or Cairns to Brisbane. Both transcontinental routes (Adelaide-Darwin and Sydney-Perth) are luxury services that are primarily aimed at tourists who have a lot of time and money on their hands, so unless you are a rail travel enthusiast, you should consider other options such as flying or driving, as they will usually be cheaper and faster.\\n\\nTasmania has no passenger rail services. The Northern Territory has the rail line linking Darwin to Adelaide through Alice Springs only, and the Australian Capital Territory has a single railway station close to the centre of Canberra. Rail service in South Australia is mainly limited to the Adelaide suburban network, though the Overland makes stops in some South Australian country towns on its way to and from Victoria.\\n\\n====Long distance train operators====\\n[[File:Indian Pacific Bellevue, Western Australia-small.jpg|thumb|Indian Pacific]]\\nLong-distance passenger trains in Australia are operated by a mix of one private operator and four state government operators. There is no centralised ticketing service covering all the long-distance railway operators in Australia, and you will need to buy separate tickets from each operator if your journey involves multiple operators.\\n* '''[https://www.journeybeyondrail.com.au/ Journey Beyond]''' - A private train operator running luxury tourist train services; ''The Ghan'' between [[Adelaide]] and [[Darwin]] via [[Alice Springs]] (only between March and November), ''The Indian Pacific'' between [[Sydney]] and [[Perth]] via Adelaide, and ''The Overland'' between Adelaide and [[Melbourne]].\\n* '''[http://www.nswtrainlink.info NSW Trainlink Regional]''' - Links Sydney to Melbourne, [[Brisbane]] and Canberra, and regional trains radiating out of Sydney to New South Wales country towns, including [[Dubbo]], [[Coffs Harbour]], and [[Griffith]].

The best location is near, but not on, the main exit from the town you are in.\\n\\n===By bicycle===\\nCycling the long distances between towns in Australia is not common, and most long-distance highways in Australia have poorly developed facilities for cyclists. for example, to cycle between Sydney and Brisbane you would have to allow 2\\u20133 weeks with around 80\\u2013100&nbsp;km per day.\\n\\nIntrepid travellers do manage to cover the longer distances by bicycle, and have a different experience of Australia. Long distance cyclists can be encountered on the Nullarbor and other isolated highways.\\n\\nIn some states, former railway lines have been changed into rail trails. [https://www.railtrails.org.au/ Rail Trail Australia] website has good material of routes off the main highways, with the Murray to the Mountains Train being the best quality trail with the most to see and do along the route. In Western Australia long-distance cycle trails have been developed for mountain bikers. The Munda Biddi trail is many days through bushland, with huts provided for camping along the route.\\n\\nWherever you cycle - if you leave the urban sprawl of the capital cities, plan carefully and carry supplies.\\n\\nSee '''[[Cycling in New South Wales]]''' for details specific to New South Wales.\\n\\n===Hiking===\\n{{main|Hiking and bushwalking in Australia}}\\nWalking through some parts of Australia is the only way to experience some particular landscapes. In Tasmania the Central Highland [[Overland Track]] and the South Coast Track are good examples of walking/hiking holiday ''to do'' items. The Bicentennial National Trail is one of the longest trails in the world, stretching from [[Cooktown]] in Northern Queensland, to [[Healesville]] in [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].\\n\\n==See==\\n\\n===Wildlife===\\n[[File:Koala climbing tree.jpg|thumb|A koala]]\\n{{see also|Australasian wildlife}}\\nAustralian flora and fauna is unique to the island continent, the result of having been isolated from the rest of the world for millions of years. Amongst Australian animals are a large group of marsupials (mammals with a pouch) and monotremes (mammals that lay eggs). Just some of the animal icons of Australia are the kangaroo (national symbol) and the koala. A visit to Australia would not be complete without taking the chance to see some of these animals in their natural environment.\\n\\n====Wildlife parks and zoos====\\n* '''Wildlife parks and zoos''' are in every state capital city, but also check out the animal parks if you are passing through smaller towns, like [[Mildura]] or [[Mogo]], or staying on [[Hamilton Island]]. See the Warrawong Fauna Sanctuary if you are in South Australia, or visit the koalas with best view in the world, at Taronga Zoo in Sydney.\\n\\n====In the wild====\\n\\n[[File:Tassy Devil.jpg|thumb|A Tasmanian devil]]\\n* '''Kangaroos''' and '''wallabies''' are in national parks all around Australia. You won't see any kangaroos hopping down the street in [[Sydney/City|Central Sydney]], but they're common on the outskirts of most urban areas.\\n* '''Wombats''' and '''echidnas''' are also common, but harder to find due to their camouflage and tunnelling. See lots of echidnas on Kangaroo Island.\\n* '''Koalas''' are present in forests around Australia, but are notoriously very hard to spot, and walking around looking upwards into the boughs of trees will usually send you sprawling over a tree root. Best seen during the day, there is a thriving and friendly population on Raymond Island near [[Paynesville (Victoria)|Paynesville]] in Victoria. You have a good chance on Otway Coast, on the [[Great Ocean Road]], or even in the National Park walk near [[Noosa]] on the Sunshine Coast.\\n* '''Emus''' are more common in central Australia. You will certainly see some if you venture into the outback national park at [[Currawinya National Park|Currawinya]]\\n* '''Cassowaries''' are found mainly in the tropical rainforests of [[North Queensland]], but as they are critically endangered, you would be very lucky to spot one.\\n* '''Platypus''' are found in reedy, flowing creeks with soft river banks in Victoria, Southern New South Wales, and the very southern region of Queensland - seen at dusk and dawn - you have to have a bit of luck to see one. Try the platypus reserves in [[Bombala]] or [[Delegate]] in New South Wales, or in Emu Creek at [[Skipton (Victoria)|Skipton]] just out of [[Ballarat]].\\n\\n===Convict sites===\\nMuch of Australia's modern history was as a penal colony for convicts from the United Kingdom, and there are many historical sites that still stand as a reminder of the days of convict transportation. Perhaps the most famous of these sites are [[Port Arthur (Tasmania)|Port Arthur]] in [[Tasmania]] and Fremantle Prison in [[Perth/Fremantle|Fremantle]], located near [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]]. There are also many other sites scattered throughout the country.\\n\\n===Landmarks===\\n[[File:07 Sydney Opera House in black and white, Australia.jpg|thumb|Sydney Opera House, one of Australia's most recognised landmarks]]\\nAustralia has many landmarks, famous the world over. From [[Ulu\\u1e5fu]] in the Red Centre, to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House in Sydney.\\n\\nSmall Australian towns have a tradition of making big sculptures as landmarks. See [[Big things in Australia]].\\n\\nAustralia has thousands of heritage-registered sites, with 20 [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].\\n\\nAustralia may not be a very religious country, but there are some churches that are well-known architectural landmarks. Some examples include St. Mary's Cathedral in [[Sydney]] and St. Peter's Cathedral in [[Adelaide]].\\n\\n===National parks===\\n{{see also|Conservation areas in Australia|National parks in Australia}}\\n[[File:Beech Forest (AU), Great Otway National Park, Beauchamp Falls -- 2019 -- 1271.jpg|thumb|Beauchamp Falls, Great Otway National Park, Victoria]]\\nPerhaps the best of what can be found in the natural side of Australia is best found in its national parks. Australia has more than 500 or so national parks, which makes Australia the country having the most national parks in the world. Although that number can make it somewhat hard to pick, there are some particular national parks in particular that stand out to travellers more than others. Some national parks (including [[Munga-Thirri\\u2013Simpson Desert National Park|Australia's largest]]) are located in very remote areas with no roads leading there, and the only way to access them is off-road driving in a four-wheel drive; be sure to make ample preparations and stock up on food, water and fuel before you attempt to visit one of these, and it is highly recommended that you rent a [[Mobile phones#Satellite phones|satellite phone]] despite the high cost in case of emergencies. Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia are also home to '''conservation parks''', which are also protected areas of outstanding natural beauty, but not considered to be of enough national significance to be declared national parks.\\n\\nIn New South Wales, a trip is never complete without going to [[Blue Mountains National Park]], just west of Sydney and a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], home to several indigenous sacred sites, along with several lookouts, mountains and plateaus. Other national parks in New South Wales that are popular include [[Royal National Park]], a popular beachside spot and the world's second oldest national park just south of Sydney, [[Kosciuszko National Park]] for being home to Australia's tallest mountain on the mainland, [[Dorrigo National Park]] or [[New England National Park]] for its Gondwana Rainforests, or a more isolated [[Mungo National Park]] home to the unusual but yet great \\\"Walls of China\\\" formation.\\n\\nIn the Northern Territory, the two most famous parks by far are [[Kakadu National Park]] and [[Ulu\\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\\u1e6fa National Park]], two icons of Australia which are both pretty self explanatory. Other popular national parks include [[Litchfield National Park]] home to several waterfalls, [[Nitmiluk National Park|Nitmiluk]] for the Katherine Gorge, [[Tjoritja / West MacDonnell National Park]] and [[Watarrka National Park]] for their gorges and canyons.\\n\\nIn Queensland, similar to the Northern Territory, the two most famous and internationally recognized parks are the [[Daintree Rainforest]] and the [[Great Barrier Reef]], one for being the world's oldest living rainforest while the latter for being the world's largest reef system. Other popular national parks include [[Lamington National Park]] for its Gondwana Rainforests or [[K'gari|Great Sandy National Park]] for being the world's largest sand island and the only place in the world where forest grows on sand or the [[Whitsunday Islands]], home to some of the world's whitest beaches. Other important but relatively unknown national parks include [[Boodjamulla National Park]], a world heritage site for its fossils or [[Carnarvon National Park]] for its landscape and rock art.\\n\\nIn South Australia, national parks tend to be of different quality, and by far the most recognised one is [[Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park]], what first comes in mind for many who think about South Australia. Others include [[Naracoorte Caves National Park]], a world heritage site for its fossils, or [[the Coorong]], the world's longest beach and an important Aboriginal cultural site.\\n\\nTasmania has by far the most wilderness, and with almost a little less than 50% of [[Tasmanian national parks|its national parks]] as world heritage sites, it can be hard to decide which ones to visit. [[Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park]] is by far its most iconic national park, while [[Southwest National Park]] is the largest in the state. For those interesting in mountains that are easily accessible, [[Hartz Mountains National Park]] or [[Mount Field National Park]] is generally the national park to go, with the latter along with [[Ben Lomond National Park]] known for skiing and snowsports. For the parks of other kinds, [[Freycinet National Park]] is known for its beaches while [[Tasman National Park]] has some of the world's highest ocean cliffs.\\n\\nVictoria, despite being the smallest mainland state has quite a lot more to offer than you might think. Its most iconic one is [[Port Campbell National Park]], and although the name of the park is not well known, one of its main features \\u2013 the 12 Apostles \\u2013 is what brings so much visitors to it. Others include [[Wilsons Promontory]], home to the southernmost point of the Australian mainland, or [[Murray Sunset National Park]], home to a pink lake.\\n\\nWestern Australia, being the world's second largest jurisdictions has plenty to offer. In particular, the one that's most known is [[Nambung National Park]] for its Pinnacles Desert, but others include [[Kalbarri National Park]] or [[Karijini National Park]] both home to several unique geological formations, or [[Murujuga National Park]] for being home to some of the world's densest collections of rock art. [[Purnululu National Park]] or [[Shark Bay]] both tend to be a bit far from [[Perth]], but both are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, both offering something unique in sight. And if you thought that everything that's scenic has to be on land \\u2013 you could be hardly ever more wrong. The Ningaloo Marine Park (and [[Exmouth (Western Australia)|Exmouth]] and [[Coral Bay]]) have a lot to offer, especially for those keen in marine life.\\n\\n===Space===\\n{{main|Astrotourism in Australia}}\\nThe vast open outback in Australia makes Australia a prime destination for space-enthusiasts. However, unlike the Northern Hemisphere, the constellations here are very different, owing to the fact that Australia is in the southern hemisphere. There are plenty of [[Astrotourism in Australia|astrotourism]] sites, ranging from a cities, to as far deep in the outback as you can go.\\n===Sports===\\n[[File:Ball is in dispute in Hawthorn-Essendon AFL match.jpg|thumb|Attending an AFL match is a must in Melbourne]]\\nSport is an integral part of the Australian culture from the capital cities to country towns. As a testament to this, Australia has a track record of being one of the best performing teams at the Olympics despite its relatively small population. The majority of games are played over the weekend period (from Friday night to Monday night). Australian sports fans are generally well behaved, and it is not uncommon for fans of two opposing teams to sit together during a match, even if the teams are bitter rivals. While the cheering can get really passionate, actual crowd violence is extremely rare.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Football|The term \\\"football\\\" can be ambiguous in Australia, and differs in meaning depending on where you are and who you are talking to. However, the term on its own is almost never used to refer to association football, which is known as \\\"soccer\\\" in Australia. In general, \\\"football\\\", or the slang term \\\"footy\\\", refers to '''rugby league''' in the states of Queensland and New South Wales, while it refers to '''Australian rules football''' anywhere else in Australia.\\n\\nThe unqualified term '''rugby''' always refers to rugby union in Australia, even in Queensland and New South Wales where rugby league predominates. Therefore, if someone from Queensland or New South Wales askes if you \\\"prefer football or rugby\\\", they are asking if you prefer rugby league or rugby union.}}\\n* In the winter in Victoria '''[[Australian rules football]]''' (Aussie Rules, or in some areas just \\\"footy\\\") is more than just a sport, it is a way of life. Catch a game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Although originating from and most popular in the state of Victoria, the premier national competition, known as the '''[https://www.afl.com.au/ Australian Football League (AFL)]''', has teams from Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and the Gold Coast as well, and will have an additional team from Hobart starting from 2028. The '''AFL Grand Final''', held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground either in late September or early October each year, is the most watched event on the Australian sporting calendar. The AFL now runs a women's league, known as '''[https://womens.afl AFL Women's]''', during the summer. While obviously not as popular as the men's game, it still enjoys a decent following. The next women's season in 2020 will feature 14 teams from all of the current men's AFL markets.\\n* In summer, international '''[[cricket]]''' is played between Australia and at least two touring sides. The games rotate around all the capital cities. To experience the traditional game catch the New Year's test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground played for 5 days starting from the 2nd of January, or the Boxing Day Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Or for a more lively entertaining form, that only takes a few hours, try a twenty-twenty match. The final form is \\\"One Day\\\" Cricket, international matches generally start at 1PM and finish at 10PM or 11PM (a \\\"Day-Nighter\\\"), with most domestic and occasional international matches played from 11AM to 6PM. The '''Australia Day''' One Day International is held in Adelaide every 26 January. '''The Ashes''' is a series of five test matches played between the Australian and English national teams. It is held in Australia every three or four years, and is one of the highlights of the cricket calendar. Whenever Australia hosts the series, the five matches are held in the five largest cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.\\n* The '''[https://ausopen.com/ Australian Open]''', one of the '''tennis''' Grand Slams, is played annually in January at '''[https://mopt.com.au/ Melbourne Park]''', including the main stadium of '''[http://www.rodlaverarena.com.au/ Rod Laver Arena]''', near the [[Melbourne]] city centre.\\n[[File:Hunter Stadium Day.JPG|thumb|Hunter Stadium in Newcastle]]\\n* Catch a '''[[Rugby Football#Rugby union|rugby union]]''' Super Rugby game, with teams playing from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina and Japan in Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney during late Summer/Autumn. The Australian national team, the Wallabies, also host international teams during winter, including New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina for The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri Nations tournament).\\n* '''[[Rugby Football#Rugby league|Rugby League]]''' is a winter game played mainly in New South Wales and Queensland, with the '''[https://www.nrl.com/ National Rugby League (NRL)]''' competition being the premier competition. Teams include Melbourne in Victoria, Brisbane, North Queensland and the Gold Coast in Queensland, a team from New Zealand, with the rest of the teams coming from suburban areas in Sydney, and some in regional areas of New South Wales such as Newcastle and Canberra. The competition culminates in the '''NRL Grand Final''', which is held every year in the Stadium Australia in Sydney. The biggest event in the rugby league calendar of Australia is the '''State of Origin''' series between teams representing the states of New South Wales and Queensland, which consists of an annual series of three matches of which two are played in Sydney and Brisbane, and the third is played in either of those cities or sometimes, Melbourne or Perth. Many fans consider the level of play in the State of Origin series to be even higher than that in the Rugby League World Cup.\\n* '''Netball''' is Australia's largest female sport, and there are weekly games in the domestic Super Netball league (which replaced a previous transnational league that also included New Zealand sides). The Australian national team is arguably the strongest in the world, with England, New Zealand and Jamaica usually posing the biggest challenge to Australian dominance.\\n* '''Soccer''' is a growing sport that is aspiring to reach European levels and is very popular at amateur stages. Many immigrants and second-generation Australians hail from European countries where passion for the sport is very high. The Australia national team (the Socceroos) won the Asia Cup for the first time in 2015 and have raised the sport's profile significantly. There is a national A-League, which is a fully professional league involving teams from Australia and one from New Zealand, with games played weekly during the summer. Most cities have a semi-professional \\\"state league\\\" played during winter, with most clubs being built around a specific ethnic/migrant community, for example a [[Newcastle (New South Wales)|Newcastle]] league side Broadmeadow Magic, which was built around the cities' Macedonian population. While women's soccer is less popular as a spectator sport, it enjoys a decent following, with the national team (the Matildas) regularly participating in the World Cup. The women's counterpart to the A-League is the W-League.\\n* '''[[Formula One|F1 Grand Prix]]''' The Melbourne Grand Prix in March takes place on a street circuit around Albert Park Lake, only a few kilometres south of central Melbourne. It is used annually as a racetrack for the Australian Grand Prix and associated support races.\\n* The '''Supercars Championship''' is a popular form of motor racing unique to Australia involving powerful cars, comparable to NASCAR racing in the United States\\u2014though unlike NASCAR, which races almost exclusively on oval tracks, the Supercars series uses road courses and street circuits. Events are held all over the country between March and early December. The famous Bathurst 1000 is traditionally held in October.\\n* '''[[Horse racing]]''' is Australia's third most popular spectator sport after Australian rules football and rugby league, and races are held regularly in all of Australia's state capitals. The premier event in Australia's horse racing calendar is the annual '''Melbourne Cup''', which also ranks among the most prestigious races in the world. The day of the Melbourne Cup is a public holiday in the state of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]], and people throughout Australia who do not usually follow horse racing will tune in just for this day.\\n\\n===Itineraries===\\n* [[Anne Beadell Highway]]\\n* [[Gibb River Road]]\\n* [[Grand Pacific Drive]]\\n* [[Great Ocean Road]]\\n* [[Gunbarrel Highway]]\\n* [[Oodnadatta Track]]\\n* [[Stuart Highway]]: crossing Australia north-south\\n* [[Tourist Drive 33]]\\n* [[Waterfall Way]]\\n* [[Military museums and sites in Australia]]\\n\\n==Do==\\n[[File:Bondi 1.jpg|thumb|Australia is known for having some of the most beautiful beaches in the world (Bondi Beach pictured)]]\\n[[File:Gold-Coast-Skyline-at-Night.jpg|thumb|Surfers Paradise, located in the Gold Coast, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, boasting some of the world's greatest beaches and located near an array of theme parks]]\\n\\n===Swim===\\n* '''in the surf'''. Australia has seemingly endless sandy beaches. Follow the crowds to the world-famous [[Sydney/Bondi|Bondi Beach]] in Sydney, or [[Surfers Paradise]] on the Gold Coast. Or find a stretch all for yourself (but beware of dangerous rips on beaches, it is considerably safer to find a patrolled beach). The surf is smaller and warmer in the Tropical North, where the reef breaks the swell, and larger and colder in the south with waves rolling in from the Southern Ocean. (And yes, in the middle it is ''just right'').\\n* '''in calm tropical oceans'''. Cable Beach in [[Broome]] is swept pristine daily by the tide, has perfect sand, and warm water - go in winter.\\n* '''in thermal pools'''. South of Darwin there are many natural thermal pools such as Berry Springs & Mataranka, surrounded by palms and tropical foliage. The most expensive resort in the world couldn't dream of making a pool this good.\\n* '''in freshwater lakes'''. Inland Australia tends to be dry, but there are freshwater lakes where you would least expect them. Explore inland of Cairns at the Atherton Tablelands, or head outback to the [[Currawinya National Park]]. Watch out for crocodiles.\\n* '''in rivers'''. If its hot, and there is water, there will be a place to swim. Wherever you are, just ask around for the favourite swimming spot, with a waterhole and rope to swing on. Watch out for crocodiles.\\n* '''in man-made pools'''. The local swimming pool is often the hub of community life on a summer Sunday in the country towns of New South Wales and Victoria. Many of the beachside suburbs of Sydney and Newcastle have man made rock/concrete pools called 'baths' where you can swim beside the ocean beaches.\\n* '''on the beach'''! Find your spot by the water, and get out the towel. Tropical north in the winter, down south in the summer. As always when in Australia, protect yourself from the sun.\\n\\n===Bushwalking===\\n{{main|Hiking in Australia}}\\nBushwalking is a popular Australian activity. You can go bushwalking in the many national parks and rainforests. Some areas also have guided bush walks by the local Aboriginal people, and these are an excellent opportunity to learn about the culture of the local Aboriginal ethnic group.\\n\\n===Diving===\\n[[File:Giant clam with diver.jpg|thumb|A scuba diver looking at a giant clam on the Great Barrier Reef]]\\n* '''Snorkelling''' take a trip out to the [[Great Barrier Reef]] on the Queensland coast, or the [[Exmouth (Western Australia)|Ningaloo Reef]] off the coast of Western Australia. Or take a trip out to Julian rocks off [[Byron Bay]], or just dive in off the beach to see the tropical fish in [[Bundaberg]].\\n* [[Scuba diving in Australia|Scuba Diving]]\\n\\n===Sports===\\n* [[Golf in Australia|Golf]]\\n* '''Rock Climbing'''\\n* '''Mountain Biking'''. Try the trails in the [[Snowy Mountains]] or black mountain in Canberra, or cycle for days along the Munda Biddi Mountain Bike trail in Western Australia.\\n* '''Horse Riding'''. The horse has a rich tradition in the settlement of Australia since the arrival of the first European settlers. Relying on the horse to travel the vast distances and harsh environments of Australia was the foundation of a strong and lasting relationship between Australians and their horses. Today horse riding in Australia includes many recreational and occupational activities from cattle musters on vast stations, to the multimillion-dollar racing industry. On the outskirts of towns and cities and out in the rural landscape, you will see the many pony paddocks and much loved horses that are a testament to the ongoing passion and commitment Australian horse owners have to their horses and the enjoyment they bring.\\n\\n===Ski===\\n\\nAustralia is not a premier worldwide destination for skiing, and its relatively low mountains mean that snow can be unpredictable. Nevertheless, if you are there during (southern) winter months then New South Wales and Victoria have well developed ski facilities. Tasmania can also have skiing for a few months of the year, given the right weather.\\n\\nSee [[Winter sports in Australia]]\\n\\n===Surf===\\nIf you think Australia is the most unpopulated and most remote place on earth where you can go to escape any trace of human contact, just find a good surf break in the most remote corner of Australia and you will be guaranteed to find someone surfing it. Australians love to surf and wherever there is surf there are Aussie surfers, any time and under any conditions. Virtually every coastline, except along the top end from Cairns across to Karatha has surf and surfers there to ride it.\\n\\n===Thrill activities===\\n* '''Sky Diving''', all around Australia\\n* '''Hot Air Ballooning''', in Canberra, Brisbane or in the [[Red Centre#Do|Red Centre]].\\n* '''Kitesurfing''' and '''windsurfing''' in and around Geraldton, Western Australia and at '''Coronation Beach''', the windsurfing and kitesurfing capital of Australia\\n* '''Whitewater rafting''' in [[Tasmania]] or [[Far North Queensland]].\\n\\n=== Gamble ===\\n[[File:2008BerriganCup1.JPG|thumb|Horse racing at the Berrigan Cup race meeting in the small New South Wales town of Berrigan]]\\nIt has been said that if there are two flies crawling up a wall, then you just need to look around to find the Aussie who will be running a book.\\n\\n* '''Casinos'''. Crown Casino in Melbourne is Australia's largest, located at Southbank, but there are others in every capital city and in Cairns, [[Launceston]], Alice Springs, the Gold Coast and [[Townsville]].\\n* '''[[Horse racing|Day at the races]]'''. All capital cities have horse racing every weekend, with on-track and off-track betting available. They are usually family occasions, and fashion and being seen are part of the event. Just about every pub in New South Wales will have a tab, where you can place a bet without leaving your chair at the bar. Greyhound racing and trotting happens in the evenings, usually with smaller crowds, more beer, and less fashion. Smaller country towns have race meetings every few months or even annually. These are real events for the local communities, and see the smaller towns come to life. Head outback to the [[Birdsville]] races, or if you find the streets deserted it is probably ten past three on the first Tuesday in November (the running of the Melbourne Cup).\\n* '''The unusual'''. Lizard races, cane toad races, camel races, crab races. Betting on these races is totally illegal and you'll find the TIB (Totally Illegal Betting) around the back of the shed.\\n* '''Two up'''. If you are around for Anzac Day (25 April), then betting on coins thrown into the air will be happening at your local RSL club, wherever you are.\\n* Australia has almost a quarter of all the '''slot machines''' (locally known as \\\"pokies\\\" or \\\"poker machines\\\") in the world, and more than half of these are in New South Wales, where most pubs and clubs have gaming rooms (labelled \\\"VIP lounges\\\" for legal reasons) where one can \\\"have a slap\\\" and go for the feature. Just don't get addicted.\\n* If none of this appeals, and you just have too much money in your pocket, every town and suburb in Australia has a TAB (Totalisator Agency Board \\u2013 betting shop), though these are usually sad, dim affairs filled with old men. Pick your sport, pick a winner, and hand over your money at the counter.\\n\\nGambling is illegal for under-18's. This can often restrict entry to parts of pubs, clubs, and casinos for children.\\n\\n===Royal shows===\\nEach of Australia's states and mainland territories is home to a '''royal show''', which are agricultural fairs that also feature amusement rides and other forms of entertainment, and serve as Australia's equivalent of state fairs in the United States. These shows are held in the respective state and territory capitals, usually during the spring or autumn months.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n[[File:Pitt Street Mall February 2016.jpg|thumb|Pitt Street Mall in Sydney is one of Australia's busiest shopping districts]]\\n{{see also|Shopping in Australia}}\\n===Money===\\n{{exchange rate AUD|currencies=USD,EUR,GBP,CAD,NZD}}\\n{{infobox|Gold coins|No, those aren't coins made out of gold, it's just an informal way of what Australians call a $1 or a $2 coin. Non-profit museums and charities often request \\\"gold coin donations\\\", meaning either (or more!) is fine.}}\\nThe Australian currency is known as the '''dollar''', denoted by the symbol \\\"'''$'''\\\" or \\\"'''A$'''\\\" (ISO code: '''AUD'''). It is divided into 100 '''cents (c)'''. In this guide, the \\\"$\\\" sign denotes Australian dollars unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nCoins come in denominations of 5\\u00a2, 10\\u00a2, 20\\u00a2, the 12-sided 50\\u00a2, $1 and the tiny $2. Notes come in denominations of $5 (mauve), $10 (blue), $20 (red), $50 (yellow) and $100 (green). $100 notes are rare and sometimes hard to use in shops. Modern Australian notes are printed on plastic polymer rather than paper. Older paper notes (though exceedingly rare) may not be accepted by many merchants, but they can be exchanged for newer polymer notes at most banks for free. If the total of a transaction is not a multiple of 5 cents the amount will be rounded to the nearest five cents if you are paying in cash. The exact amount will be charged if paying by card.\\n\\nThe dollar is not pegged to any other currency, and is highly traded on world foreign exchange markets, particularly by currency speculators. Its exchange value to other currencies can be quite volatile, and 1-2% changes in a day are reasonably regular occurrences.\\n\\n===Currency exchange===\\n[[File:Australian banknotes in wallet.jpg|thumb|Australian dollar banknotes in a wallet]]\\nYou won't need much cash in Australia, as almost all businesses accept credit cards and debit cards. Cash is still handy to have, especially since some cafes, pubs and restaurants add a fee for card payments (usually 1-2%, which must be on a sign at the register).\\n\\nAs the Australian dollar is considered to be a major world currency, it is widely available at money changers and banks throughout the world.\\n\\nMoney changers in Australia operate in a free market, and charge a range of flat commissions, percentage fees, undisclosed fees built into the exchange rate, or a combination of all three. You can avoid rip-off rates by using banks in major centres, and staying clear of airports and tourist centres. However, both the best and worst rates come from the small private sellers, and you can certainly save money over the banks by shopping around. Always get a quote before changing money. You'll usually need to have photo identification with you, although you may be exempt if only changing a small amount.\\n\\nDedicated currency exchange outlets are widely available in major cities, and banks can also exchange most non-restricted currencies. These exchange outlets \\u2014 especially the ones at the airport \\u2014 usually give terrible rates, usually around 10% from current exchange midpoint. Australian banks usually offer an exchange rate around 2.5% from the current exchange midpoint. A flat commission of $5\\u20138 can be charged on top. Some outlets advertise commission free exchange, usually accompanied by a worse rate of exchange. Don't assume every bank will offer the same exchange rate. There are vouchers for commission free exchange at American Express available in the tourist brochure at Sydney Airport.\\n\\nInternational airport terminals will have teller machines that can dispense Australian currency with Cirrus, Maestro, MasterCard or Visa cards.\\n\\n===Banking===\\nOpening an Australian bank account is fairly straightforward if you have a residential address in Australia. You will need to provide evidence of your identity, such as a passport, to the bank in order for your application to be processed. The largest retail banks in Australia are '''[http://www.nab.com.au National Australia Bank (NAB)]''', '''[http://www.anz.com Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ)]''', '''[https://www.commbank.com.au/ Commonwealth Bank]''' and '''[http://www.westpac.com.au/ Westpac]'''.\\n\\nCash dispensing Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are available in almost every Australian town. Australian ATMs are deregulated and may impose a surcharge over what is charged by your bank or card issuer. The fees can vary between institutions and between locations, but are usually around $2. The ATM will display the charges and you will have the option to stop the transaction before you are charged. Check with your bank as to what additional fees they apply to withdrawals in Australia.\\n\\n===Costs===\\n{{infobox|Fast changing currency valuations|The Australian dollar is one of the world's more dynamic currencies, partly because of its relation to commodity prices such as iron and coal. Within the past 10 years the 'Aussie' has swung between 50\\u00a2 to $1.50 to the United States dollar, making the cost of visiting range from reasonable to very expensive depending on exactly when you are there.}}\\n\\nAustralia is generally an expensive place to visit, with some surveys<!-- Any notable ones, peer reviewed etc?--> having ranked Australia as the third most expensive country in the world in terms of consumer prices, only behind Norway and Switzerland.\\n\\nDorm accommodation in a capital city is around $30, but can run as low as $15 in Cairns or cheaper backpacker centres. A basic motel in the country or in the capital city suburbs would cost upwards of $100 for a double. City Centre hotel accommodation in capital cities can be obtained for around $200 upwards for a double. Formule 1/Motel 6 style hotels (which are not common) can be around $100 for a double.\\n\\nCar hire (rental) will cost around $65 a day. Public transport day passes from $9\\u201320 per day depending on the city.\\n\\nA cafe meal costs around $15-20, and a main course in a restaurant goes from around $25 upwards.\\n\\nA basic takeaway meal - a burger, sandwich, or couple of slices of pizza costs $10, a Big Mac costs $7.90, and you can usually grab a pie or sausage roll from $5.\\n\\nA middy/pot (285mL) of house beer will cost you around $8, and a glass of house wine around $10 in a low end pub. To take away, a case of 24 cans of beer will cost at least $45, or a bottle of wine from $10.\\n\\nAn airfare between neighbouring eastern capitals is around $150 each way but can get as low as $60 if you book at the right time, or around $350 to cross the country assuming that you are flexible with dates and book in advance. A train trip on the state-run trains will usually cost slightly less. A bus trip, a little less again. A train trip on the private, luxury trains is the most expensive way to travel.\\n\\nThere is usually no admission charge to beaches or city parks. Some popular National Parks charge between $6 and $20 per day (per car, or per person depending on the state) while more out of the way National Parks are free. Art Galleries and some attractions are free. Museums generally charge around $10 per admission. Theme parks charge around $70 per person.\\n\\n===Tax===\\nAustralia has a 10% ''Goods and Services Tax (GST)'' that applies to all goods and services except unprocessed foods, education and medical services. GST is always ''included'' in the displayed price of any consumer purchases. Receipts (tax invoices) will contain the GST amount.\\n\\n==== Tourist Refund Scheme ====\\nIf you buy goods worth more than $300 at one place, over one or multiple invoices, you can obtain a refund of the GST (plus WET for wine) if you take the items out of Australia within 60 days. Unlike in many other countries, this applies to both Australian citizens and foreigners. Make sure you get a tax invoice from the supplier (which will have the goods itemised, the GST paid, and the ABN of the supplier). If possible, pre-fill the refund form online for faster processing. You may discard the packaging and start using the goods while still in Australia. Pack the items in hand luggage, and present the item(s) and the receipt at the TRS, after immigration and security when leaving Australia. If any of the items have to be checked in for whatever reason, make sure that you locate the customs office and let customs officers sight the goods before checking-in your bags. Also allow at least an extra 30 minutes before departure. The refund payment can be made by either cheque, credit to an Australian bank account, or payment to a credit card. There is no refund available for GST on services. Remember the goods are now considered duty-free, so they will now count against your duty-free allowance should you bring them back to Australia in the future, and you will need to pay GST on them should your duty free allowance be exceeded.\\n\\n===Credit cards===\\nCredit cards are widely accepted in Australia. '''Visa''' and '''MasterCard''' are the most accepted cards. American Express and Diners Club are accepted at major supermarket and department store chains. Any card showing the Cirrus or Maestro logos can be used at any terminal displaying those logos. Australian debit cards can also be used via a system known as EFTPOS. UnionPay, AliPay and WeChat Pay are becoming more common in tourist shops and restaurants due to the rising number of Chinese visitors. It is difficult to use them in other businesses however.\\n\\n'''Apple Pay,''' '''Google Pay,''' '''Samsung Pay,''' and contactless credit cards are accepted. You will only need to enter a PIN if the purchase is over $100.\\n\\nAustralian credit cards are issued with a PIN. If you have an overseas card without a PIN you can still sign for purchases, however shopkeepers unused to dealing with overseas cards may not be aware of this. Try to have a PIN on your card if your bank allows it. If not, you may have to explain that you have an overseas card and wait while the shopkeeper finds a pen.\\n\\nCredit card surcharges are imposed at all car rental agencies, travel agents, airlines, and at some discount retailers (such as Aldi) and service stations. They are increasingly common in cafes, bars and restaurants. Surcharges are far more common and higher for American Express and Diners Club (typically 2%-4%) than they are for Visa and MasterCard (typically 1.5%).\\n\\n===Haggling===\\nBargaining is uncommon in Australian stores, though vendors are usually willing to meet or beat a quote or advertised price from a competing retailer. It's also worth asking for a \\\"best price\\\" for high-value goods or purchases involving several items. For example, it would not be unusual to get 10% off an item of jewellery that was not already reduced in price. The person you are dealing with may have limited authority to sell items at anything other than the marked price. Attempting to haggle without a reason will most likely be perceived as rude in Australia and will be unsuccessful.\\n\\n===Tipping===\\n[[Tipping]] is ''not'' customary in Australia, although tips are accepted if you freely choose to give one.\\n\\nRestaurants are required to include the cost of service and taxes in posted prices. You may, however, choose to leave a small tip if the service was exemplary. When paying by credit card, some restaurants give the option of adding a tip to your payment, although it is completely optional. Other places provide a coin jar or bowl by the cashier labelled \\\"Tips\\\", but the vast majority of Australian diners do not leave one. Bartenders are usually not tipped.\\n\\nOther types of service personnel, including hotel staff, porters, tour guides, food delivery drivers and hairdressers do not expect to receive tips.\\n\\nTipping is also not expected in taxis, and drivers will typically return your change to the last 5 cents, though it is not uncommon for Australians to ask the driver to round the fare up to the nearest dollar.\\n \\nCasinos in Australia generally prohibit tipping of gaming staff, as it is considered bribery. Similarly, offering to tip government officials will usually be interpreted as bribery and can potentially be treated as a criminal offence.\\n\\n===Trading hours===\\n[[File:The_Strand_Arcade_interior_photographed_from_the_top_level,_Sydney_01.jpg|thumb|The Strand Arcade, [[Sydney]]]]\\n\\nAustralia's '''base trading hours''' are Monday to Friday 9AM-5PM. Shops usually have a single night of late night trading, staying open until 9PM on Fridays in most cities and on Thursdays in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. Sunday trading is common in the main cities but does not exist in all rural areas. Opening hours beyond these base hours vary by the type of store, by location, and by state. See our localised guides for more local information.\\n\\nMajor supermarket chains in main centres are generally open at least until 9PM on weekdays (and often until midnight), but generally have reduced hours on weekends. Convenience stores such as 7/11 are open 24 hours in major centres.\\n\\nFast food restaurant chains are commonly open 24 hours or at least very late. Many food courts in city centres typically close by 4PM and completely close on weekends if targeting office workers, but other eateries and food courts in shopping centres have longer hours.\\n\\nFuel/service stations are open 24 hours in major centres, but often close at 6pm and on Sundays in country towns.\\n\\nAustralia's '''weekend''' is on Saturday and Sunday of each week. Retail trading is now almost universal in larger cities on weekends, although with slightly reduced hours. Again, Western Australia is an exception with restrictions on large stores opening on Sundays. In smaller country towns shops are closed on Sundays and often also on Saturday afternoons. Businesses in towns with heavy tourist visitation will often be open on Saturday and Sunday as a means of serving weekend visitors, but will take their weekends on Monday and Tuesday instead, so expect reduced service in some towns on those days.\\n\\nTourist-oriented towns and shops may stay open longer hours. Tourist areas within cities, such as [[Sydney/Darling Harbour|Darling Harbour]] in Sydney have longer trading hours every night.\\n\\nAustralian banks are open Monday-Friday 9AM-4PM only, often closing at 5PM on Fridays. Cash is available through Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) 24 hours, and currency exchange outlets have extended hours and are open on weekends.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n{{see also|Australian cuisine}}\\nAustralian cuisine was mainly influenced by its British and Irish colonial heritage until the 1960s and 70s, but with a history of immigration from other parts of Europe like Germany, Italy, Greece and Poland, the influence of these cultures has become more evident in Australian cuisine than its British and Irish beginnings. The large influx of Asian migrants has also left its mark on Australian cuisine, with many Australian chefs incorporating Asian influences in nominally Western dishes.\\n\\nThe various Aboriginal ethnic groups have their own distinctive cuisines, though due to the fact that they make extensive use of exotic ingredients, these have for the most part not become a part of mainstream Australian cuisine.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, table manners in Australia conform to [[Europe]]an norms.\\n===Places to eat===\\n{{infobox|BYO - Bring Your Own|BYO stands for ''Bring Your Own'' (alcohol). In many of the urban communities of Australia you will find small low-cost restaurants that are not licensed to serve but allow diners to bring their own bottle of wine purchased elsewhere. This is frequently much cheaper than ordering a bottle of wine in a restaurant. Beer can be taken to some BYO restaurants, others allow only wine. Expect to pay a corkage fee which can vary from $2\\u201315, or may be calculated by head. BYO is not usually permitted in restaurants that are licensed to sell alcohol.}}\\n{{infobox|Where has Burger King gone?|Visitors are often surprised to find that there are no Burger Kings in Australia. Instead, in Australia, Burger King is called \\\"Hungry Jack's\\\". The name was chosen as there was already a small takeaway called Burger King in Adelaide, and so for trademark reasons, \\\"Burger King\\\" had to choose another name.\\n\\nIn 2001, Hungry Jack's won the rights to use the name \\\"Burger King\\\" as the trademark had expired, but as the name had become established, the chain instead chose to keep its name \\\"Hungry Jack's\\\".}}\\nThere is no shortage of places to eat out in the cities and towns. In addition to good restaurants offering cuisine from around the world, there are also the following:\\n\\n* '''Pubs''' usually offer a lunch and dinner menu, consisting of hearty Aussie staples like steaks, burgers, fish and chips, and chicken parmigiana.  Meals may be served at a bistro or restaurant area separate from the main counter.\\n* '''Clubs''' such as bowling clubs, leagues clubs, RSLs are in many towns and cities. They are most common in the states of Queensland and New South Wales. Most allow visitors, and sometimes offer good value meals. A quick, free registration process is often required to comply with gambling laws.\\n* '''Cafes''', most towns and suburbs have a cafe or coffee shop, serving breakfast and light meals and cakes from early morning to afternoon. The vast majority close by 4PM.\\n* '''Bakeries''', usually a good place to buy bread rolls, a pie or a sausage roll.\\n* '''Fast food restaurants''', McDonald's (or ''Macca's''), Subway and KFC are common. Burger King is rebranded as Hungry Jack's. Red Rooster is an Australian chain, offering barbecued chicken and other mostly chicken-based items and Oporto is an Australian version of Nando's.\\n* '''Take-away''', milk bars, sushi stores and other take-away stores usually sell sushi, pies, barbecued (rotisserie) chicken, hamburgers, fish and chips, gyros, and kebabs.\\n* '''Food courts''', most shopping centres have a food court, even in country towns.\\n* '''Picnic''', the Australian climate is usually amenable to getting whatever food you can, and heading to the nearest park, river, lake or beach. \\n* '''Barbecue''' is a popular Australian pastime and many parks in Australia provide free barbecues for public use. Contrary to the stereotype, Australians rarely \\\"throw a shrimp on the barbie\\\" (also, in Australia a shrimp is referred to as a prawn). Steaks, chops, sausages, chicken fillets, fish, and kebabs are popularly barbecued.\\n* '''Wineries''', many of Australia's wineries have restaurants serving modern Australian cuisine that overlook their vineyards, where you can also purchase their wines to go with your meal. Typically only open for lunch, although some upmarket places offer elaborate multicourse degustation dinners as well.\\n\\n[[File:Jackadder Lake barbecues.jpg|thumb|Outdoor barbecues at Jackadder Lake, Woodlands, Western Australia. Similar facilities can be found in many parks across Australia.]]\\n[[File:Centre Place Dec 2012.jpg|thumb|Centre Place in Melbourne's CBD is lined with cafes]]\\n\\n===Native foods===\\n[[File:Kangaroo fillet.JPG|thumb|Kangaroo fillet at a restaurant in Sydney]]\\n{{see also|Australian cuisine#Indigenous food (bush tucker)}}\\nIt may come as a disappointment that native foods are not actually available that much in Australian restaurants, nor consumed by Australians much themselves. They are available in supermarkets and in some of the remoter parts of the country. Traditional Aboriginal diets can include endangered species, the consumption of which is strictly restricted to specific communities and unlikely to be available to you.\\n\\n* '''Kangaroo''', if you fancy some, it is available from many supermarkets and butchers. Barbecue it until medium rare, but best not to overcook as it may become quite ''tough''. This red meat tastes much like beef and occasionally makes it onto the menu in restaurants, mostly in tourist areas. Kangaroos are abundant (over 50 million in the country), do far less damage to the sensitive native environment than hoofed animals, and produce far fewer carbon emissions as well. It makes a great environmental statement to make whilst barbecuing.\\n* '''Crocodile''', meat from farms in the Northern Territory and Queensland is widely available around the top end, and occasionally elsewhere. At Rockhampton, the beef capital of Australia, you can see the ancient reptile on a farm while munching on a croc burger. This white meat tastes much like chicken.\\n* '''Emu''', yes, you can eat the other half of the Australian Coat of Arms as well. Emu is a red meat that is low in fat and available from specialty butchers. Try the Coat of Arms in a pie in [[Maleny]] or on a pizza in [[Sydney/The Rocks|The Rocks]].\\n* '''Possum''', mostly eaten in Tasmania (especially on Bruny Island).\\n* '''Bush tucker''', many tours may give you an opportunity to try some bush tucker, the berries, nuts, roots, ants, and grubs from Australia's native bush. '''Macadamia nuts''' are the only native plant to Australia that is grown for food commercially. Some of the other bush foods can be an acquired taste, though native seasonings are certainly worth trying, and are increasingly being featured in Australian fine dining restaurants. Bush tucker ice cream can sometimes be found at farmers' markets and outdoor festivals.\\n\\n===Beyond cuisine===\\n[[File:Pavlova Dessert.jpg|thumb|A pavlova garnished with cream and raspberries]]\\nAustralia has a good deal of British-inspired food that is not well known internationally. Definitely worth a try.\\n\\n'''Vegemite''', a salty yeast-based spread, best spread thinly on toast. If you aren't up for buying a jar, any coffee shop will serve vegemite on toast at breakfast time. It may not even be on the menu, but the vegemite will be out the back in the jar next to the marmalade. If you do buy a jar, the secret is to ''spread it very thin'', and don't forget the butter as well. It tastes similar to Marmite in the UK or Cenovis in Switzerland. Australians are quite used to the taste, and may spread the Vegemite very thick; but this is not recommended for first-timers.\\n\\nThe '''Tim-Tam''' is a chocolate fudge-filled sandwich of two chocolate biscuits, all dipped in chocolate. You can buy them from any supermarket or convenience store. Tim-Tams are required to perform the ''Tim-Tam Slam'' manoeuvre. This requires biting a corner off both ends of the Tim-Tam, then using it as a straw to drink a cup of tea or coffee. This melts the centre and creates an experience hard to describe. Finesse is needed to suck the whole biscuit into your mouth in the microseconds between being fully saturated and dissolving. Tim-Tams are sold in packs of 11, so be sure to agree on the sharing arrangements before buying a packet with your travel partner, or onward travel arrangements may be disrupted. During summer Tim-Tams are often stored in the freezer and eaten ice cold. Not as good are the Indonesian-made Tim-Tams sometimes found in discount grocery stores. These can be differentiated by being thinner and often individually-wrapped.\\n\\nThe '''lamington''' is a cube of sponge cake covered in chocolate icing and dipped in desiccated coconut. It's named after Lord Lamington, who served as Governor of Queensland from 1896 to 1901. The home-baked form can be found at a local Saturday morning market, or your local bakery. The plastic-wrapped varieties sold in supermarkets are not as good.\\n\\nThe '''pavlova''' is a meringue cake with a cream topping usually decorated with fresh fruit. Served on special occasions, or after a lunchtime barbecue. Often the source of dispute with [[New Zealand#Eat|New Zealand]] over the original source of the recipe.\\n\\n'''ANZAC biscuits''' are a mix of coconut, oats, flour, sugar and golden syrup. They were reputedly sent by wives and care organisations to world war I soldiers in care packages, but the story is likely apocryphal. They are available from bakeries, cafes and supermarkets, and are popular in the lead up to ANZAC day (25 April).\\n\\n'''Damper''' is a traditional soda bread that was baked by drovers and stockmen. It has basic ingredients (flour, water and perhaps salt) and usually cooked in the embers of a fire. It is not available in bakeries and only commonly served to tourists on organised tours. Best eaten with butter and jam or golden syrup as it is dry and bland.\\n\\nA '''Chiko roll''' is a deep-fried snack inspired by the egg roll or the spring roll. Despite the name, it contains no chicken. Its filling is boned mutton, vegetables, rice, barley, and seasoning. Its shell is thicker than an egg roll, meant to survive handling at football matches. Available anywhere fish and chips are sold.\\n\\nThe '''Australian Meat Pie''' is considered to be the national dish by many. A variation is the '''pie floater''' from Adelaide which is a pie inverted in a bowl of thick mushy pea soup.\\n\\n===Other cuisines===\\nCuisines widely available in Australia, often prepared by members of the relevant culture, include:\\n\\n* '''British''', Australia's colonial heritage is perhaps best represented by the ubiquity of '''fish and chips''', and virtually every neighbourhood and small town in a coastal area will have a local fish and chip shop. Common types of fish used in Australia include flake (various types of small shark), flathead, barramundi and King George whiting. Unlike in the UK, fish and chips is typically served with ketchup and tartar sauce in Australia. British and Irish style pubs are common throughout populated areas of Australia, although they feature Australian staples such as chicken parmas, schnitzels and pasta.\\n* '''Chinese''', synonymous with the term \\\"takeaway\\\" in the past generations. Many Chinese restaurants still cater to takeaway addicts today, mostly of the Australianised Chinese variety, but major cities have small \\\"Chinatowns\\\" or suburbs with a large number of ethnic Chinese residents that have excellent restaurants serving authentic Chinese food. Cantonese Dim Sum is available in dedicated restaurants in most large shopping malls.\\n* '''Thai''' restaurants are common everywhere. Sydney in particular is known as one of the best destinations for Thai food in the world.\\n* '''Italian''', the Italian community is one of the largest ethnic communities of non Anglo-Saxon origin in Australia, and they have contributed greatly to the cafe culture that has flourished across the major cities over the past few decades. Restaurants either serve Italian food that has been adapted to suit Australian tastes, or authentic regional Italian food, with the latter tending to be pricier and in more upmarket surrounds. Head to Lygon street in Melbourne or Leichhardt in Sydney if you're a fan.\\n* '''Greek''' is not quite as widespread as Italian above, but good options exist in every city and town.\\n* '''Lebanese''' and other Middle Eastern, especially in Sydney. A '''Manoosh''' is a tasty pizza variation that is somewhat more healthy as well.\\n** A fusion dish that's becoming increasingly popular nationwide is the '''halal snack pack''' (also known by many alternate names). It consists of halal-certified doner kebab meat (originating from Turkey) and chips, smothered in sauces of your own choosing, and often cheese. Typically served in styrofoam containers as a takeaway dish. In Adelaide, the AB is similar to the halal snack pack of the eastern states, but it usually not halal.\\n* '''Indian''' is available in most cities, and often represent a good mid-range restaurant option.\\n* '''Japanese''', including bento takeaway shops, udon restaurants and sushi trains. They are often operated by '''Koreans''', whose own cuisine is also well represented in the major cities (particularly Sydney and Melbourne).\\n* '''Vietnamese''', Pho and Cha Gio (spring rolls) are easy to find in the major cities.\\n* '''German''', South Australia and Queensland in particular have had a long history of German settlement, and German restaurants can be found in major cities and in country towns that were historically settled by Germans. The '''schnitzel''' is a German dish that has been Australianised and is widely available in pubs and cafes throughout the country, though unlike German schnitzels, which are usually made of pork, Australian schnitzels are usually made of chicken or beef. A good selection of German or German-inspired sausages is also available at many butchers.\\n* '''Asian fusion''' refers generally to Asian-inspired dishes.\\n\\n===Modern Australian===\\nModern Australian is a recently developed cuisine that is often seen in [[fine dining]] establishments, analogous to Modern American cuisine in the United States. This cuisine mixes cooking styles and flavours from different parts of Europe and Asia, paying homage to the diverse origins of Australia's population, and often incorporates native Australian flavours from the bush as well.\\n\\n===Vegetarian===\\nEating vegetarian is available in Australia and many restaurants offer at least one or two vegetarian dishes. Some will have an entire vegetarian menu section. Vegans may have more difficulty but any restaurant with a large vegetarian menu should offer some flexibility. In large cities and in the coastal backpacker-friendly towns along the east coast, you will find vegetarian and vegan restaurants. The market town of [[Kuranda]] or the seaside towns of [[Byron Bay]] are a vegetarian's paradise. In other regional areas especially in the Northern Territory, North Western Australia and north Queensland vegetarians are often poorly catered-for, but most towns will have a Chinese or Thai restaurant that will provide steamed rice and vegetables. Sydney and Melbourne in particular cater well for vegans and vegetarians with a lot of purely vegetarian restaurants, vegan clothing stores and vegan supermarkets.\\n[[File:Avocado Toast Melbourne (cropped).jpg|thumb|Smashed Avo in Melbourne]]\\nQuick vegetarian options include:\\n\\n* 'Smashed Avo' is a mix of avocado and feta cheese, served on toast and with an egg. A popular breakfast option and (unfairly) associated with free-spending millennials.\\n* Sushi rolls and tofu pockets, available at sushi shops everywhere\\n* Vietnamese spring rolls (Bahn Mi) are also readily available with vegetarian fillings\\n* Korean restaurants offer rice bowls (such as Bibimbap) with no meat\\n* Pie shops have spinach rolls (filled with spinach and ricotta cheese)\\n* Most food halls have a dedicated salad counter\\n\\nMore remote outback areas may have very few vegetarian options (lots of processed meat pies and little else), so it is worth packing some vegetarian supplies before you go.\\n\\n===Religious diets===\\nPeople observing kosher or halal will easily be able to find specialist butchers in the capital cities, and will also find a number of restaurants with appropriate menus and cooking styles. Outside the capital cities, it will be much more difficult to find food prepared in a strict religious manner. Fast food chains often offer Halal certified meals in areas with large Muslim populations in Western Sydney and Melbourne.\\n\\n===Allergies===\\nAustralian restaurants generally provide options for people with common allergies such as nuts and seafood. Ask the waitstaff if in doubt.\\n\\nThe '''gluten free''' diet fad has spread to Australia, and there is no shortage of gluten free products in supermarkets, bakeries and restaurants, albeit often at higher prices than the regular versions of those products.\\n\\n===Markets===\\n[[File:SydFishMarkets.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Seafood at the Sydney Fish Markets]]\\nMelbourne's Queen Victoria Market, Adelaide's Central Market and the Fremantle Markets near Perth are perhaps Australia's best known examples of traditional European-style food markets. The Sydney Fish Market is one of the most iconic traditional seafood markets in the world.\\n\\nAll of the capital cities and most regional towns in Australia host a \\\"farmer's market\\\", which is generally held each week in a designated area on a Saturday or Sunday. These markets mostly sell fresh fruits and vegetables, as hygiene regulations in Australia forbid the selling of meat directly from market stalls. Butchers who set up shop at a farmer's market would usually trade their wares from a display cabinet within their boot (trunk). The attraction of markets is the lower prices and freshness of the produce. The attraction for the traveller will be the cheap and excellent fruits on offer - depending on the region and season (in places like Queensland or the Northern Territory, you're more likely to find mangoes while down in Tasmania you're much more likely to find apples). In regional areas the market is usually held outside the town itself in an empty paddock or sports field, markets in capital cities are easier to reach but the prices are typically more in line with those you would find in supermarkets. See the destination guides for details.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n\\n===Beer===\\nDrinking '''beer''' is ingrained in Australian culture. Although Fosters is promoted as an Australian beer overseas, it is rarely consumed by Australians, and almost impossible to find in Australia. Beer loyalties are strongly regional and every state has its own brews: Coopers and West End in South Australia, Carlton and VB in Victoria, Tooheys in NSW, XXXX (pronounced \\\"fourex\\\") in Queensland, Boags and Cascade in Tasmania, and Swan in Western Australia. Microbreweries are also extremely popular and any pub worth its salt will have half a dozen on tap: look for slightly sweet Pacific ales and hoppier Australian pale ales. A range of imported European and American bottled beers are available in all but the most basic pub.\\n[[File:XXXX Brewery Milton.jpg|thumb|The XXXX Brewery in Brisbane]]\\n\\nLight (Lite) beer refers to lower alcoholic content, and not lower calories. It has around half the alcohol of full strength beer, and is taxed at a lower rate, meaning it is also cheaper than full strength beer. Low calorie beer is sold as ''low carb''.\\n\\nBecause Australians like their beer to stay cold while they drink it, draft beer glasses come in a multitude of sizes, so that you can drink a whole glass before it warms up in the summer heat. The naming of beer glasses varies widely from state to state, often in confusing ways: a '''schooner''' (''SKOO-ner'') is 425mL everywhere except South Australia, where it's only 285mL, a size that's known elsewhere as a '''middy''' or '''pot''', except in Darwin where it's a '''handle''', but in Adelaide a \\\"pot\\\" means a 570mL full pint, and a ''pint'' means what a ''schooner'' does elsewhere, and... you get the idea. The local beers and the local descriptions are covered in detail in the state guides.\\n\\nBottle naming is a little easier: the standard sizes across Australia are the 375 mL '''stubby''' and the 750mL '''longneck''', or '''tallie'''. Cans of beer are known as '''tinnies''', and 24 of them make up a '''slab''', '''box''', '''carton''', '''bag''' or '''case'''.\\n\\n===Wine===\\n[[File:Hunter panorama-1b-web-l.jpg|thumb|Vineyards in the [[Hunter Valley]]]]\\n\\nAustralia produces quality wine on a truly industrial scale, with large multinational brands supplying Australian bottleshops and exporting around the world. There are also a multitude of boutique wineries and smaller suppliers. Very good red and white wine can be bought very cheaply in Australia, often at less than $15 a bottle, and even the smallest shop could be expected to have 50 or more varieties to choose from.\\n\\nThe areas of the [[Barossa Valley]] (near Adelaide), [[Hunter Valley]] (near Sydney), [[Yarra Valley]] (near Melbourne) and [[Margaret River]] (near Perth) are particularly renowned for their wineries and opportunities for cellar door sampling, but northern Victoria and [[Mudgee]] also have a large variety. You are never too far from a wine trail anywhere in southern Australia.\\n\\nTry the local wines wherever you can find them, and ask for local recommendations. Try not to get taken in by the label, or the price tag. The best wine is rarely the one with the best artwork, or the most expensive price. However, it is probably wise to avoid the house wine if it comes straight from a cask (4-litre container). Wines at the cellar door are almost invariably sold at around 20% premium to the same wine in the shops in the local town.\\n\\nIf you still prefer overseas wines, the [[Marlborough (New Zealand)|Marlborough]] region of New Zealand is usually well represented on wine lists and in bottle shops in Australia.\\n\\nSee also [[Grape grazing in Australia]].\\n\\n===Spirits===\\nBundaberg Rum (''Bundy'') is an Australian dark rum particularly popular in Queensland and many Queenslanders will not touch any other brand of rum. It is probably the most famous Australian made spirit, mass-produced in [[Bundaberg]] and available everywhere.\\n\\nFor many years one had to search to find other Australian distilled spirits, mostly from niche players, but there are distilleries in every state of Australia if you look hard enough and more are popping up all the time&ndash;Adelaide gin distilleries 75\\u00b0 and the Adelaide Gin Company have grown in esteem over the past few years. The tiny Sullivan's Cove distillery in Tasmania made waves in 2014 when one of their whiskies was named the World's Best Single Malt, kicking off a mini-boom in Australian whisky, and they repeated the feat in 2018 and 2019. If $8,000 for a bottle of their 2014 French Oak is a bit steep, drop into the Lark Distillery on the scenic [[Hobart]] waterfront precinct, book a gin blending experience at Archie Rose in Sydney, pick up a bottle of 151 East Vodka in [[Wollongong]] or after a few days in [[Kununurra]] you are definitely going to need an Ord River Rum.\\n\\nMixed drinks are also available, particularly vodka, scotch, bourbon and other whiskey mixers. Spirits are also available as pre-mixed bottles and cans but are subject to higher taxation in this form, so it is cheaper to mix them yourself. Spirits are served in all pubs and bars, but not in all restaurants. A basic spirit and mixer (vodka and orange juice for example) will cost you about $12 at a bar or nightclub, but can vary ~$9\\u201318.\\n\\n===Legal aspects===\\nThe legal drinking age throughout Australia is '''18 years'''. It is illegal either to purchase alcohol for yourself if you are under 18 years of age or to purchase alcohol on behalf of someone who is under 18 years of age. The only legally acceptable proof-of-age documentation are an Australian drivers licence, state-issued proof-of-age card, [https://auspost.com.au/id-and-document-services/apply-for-a-keypass-id Keypass card] or a passport, and it would be wise to carry one if you want to purchase alcohol or tobacco and look under 25 - vendors will frequently ask for ID for anybody who looks to be 25 or younger. In Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania, foreign drivers licences and foreign ID cards are '''NOT''' legally acceptable as proof of age documentation, and people who are unable to produce a passport or valid Australian ID will be refused service. Only actual ID documents will be accepted - photographs or photocopies will NOT be accepted.\\n\\nIt is illegal to go into a gambling area of a pub or club when under 18. Often there is a lounge, restaurant or bistro area in a pub or club that permits under-age people provided they are accompanied by a responsible adult over 18 and don't approach the bar or wander around. Some city pubs even have video games and playgrounds for children. Some country pubs have large open areas out in the back where kids can run and play.\\n\\nIn general, you can take alcohol (say a bottle of wine or beer) to consume at a park or beach. Alcohol consumption is banned in some public places as 'street drinking'. These are often indicated by signs and is particularly the case in parks and footpaths where public drunkenness has been a problem. However, if you are a family with your picnic basket and blanket out at lunchtime with a bottle of wine, you are unlikely to encounter any problems.\\n\\nAlcohol can be purchased for consumption on premises only in '''licensed venues''': pubs, clubs and many restaurants. You can purchase alcohol for private consumption in '''bottle shops''', which are separate stores selling bottled alcohol. In some states you can buy alcohol in '''supermarkets'''. In those states where you can't, bottle shops and major supermarkets are often found in very close proximity. Although licensing laws and hours vary from state to state, and individual stores have different trading hours, as a rule of thumb, alcohol is generally available in towns to take-away seven days a week, 8AM-11PM, from bottle shops, supermarkets, licensed grocers/milk-bars and pubs. Outside of these hours though, it is almost impossible to buy alcohol to take home; unless you're in the middle of Sydney or Melbourne, so if you're planning on a party at home; it's a good idea to stock up and check on the local trading hours so you don't run out at 12:30AM with no opportunity to buy more. Alcohol is not available at petrol stations or 24-hour convenience stores anywhere in Australia.\\n\\nPublic drunkenness varies in acceptability. You will certainly find a great deal of it in close proximity to pubs and clubs at night time but much less so during the day. Public drunkenness is an offence but the Police won't pick you up unless you're causing a nuisance. You may spend the night sobering up in a holding cell or be charged.\\n\\n'''Driving while affected by alcohol''' is stigmatized, policed by random breath-testing police patrols in Australia, and inherently dangerous. Drink driving is a very serious offence in Australia, punishable by a range of mechanisms including loss of licence. The acceptable maximum blood alcohol concentration is 0.05% Australia-wide, often lower or not allowed for operators of heavy vehicles and young or novice drivers. Police officers are also empowered to randomly test drivers for the recent use of prohibited drugs. Refusing any of these tests is a criminal offence. The operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of prohibited drugs or alcohol will always result in arrest and a required court appearance many weeks from the date of arrest and it can comprehensively disrupt travel plans. Random breath-testing is common early Saturday and Sunday mornings, and many people are caught the morning after.\\n\\n===A shout===\\n[[File:Birdsville Hotel.jpg|thumb|The Birdsville Hotel in far western Queensland]]\\nBuying a round of drinks is a custom in Australia, as in many corners of the world. It is generally expected in a pub that when you arrive and make your first trip to the bar that you will offer to buy a drink for others you are drinking with. Similarly this will likely be done to you when someone else joins the group. This is called ''a shout'', and incurs an obligation that you will generally return the favour in a following round, and that also you will generally maintain the same drinking pace as your associates in the round throughout the evening. If someone in the same round as you has an empty glass, who is ahead of you in drinks bought, you should declare that it is your shout, and make your way to the bar. If someone offers to buy you a drink, but does not offer to buy for the person who already has bought you a drink, you should say you are already in a shout, and decline. If they buy you and the people in your round a drink, they have joined the shout. Its generally not polite to switch between shouts during an evening. It you are in a large shout, and you decline a drink, you still have to buy a drink for the round when it comes to your turn. If you wish to skip a round, do so on your shout. It is generally poorly received to buy a round, and then to refuse a drink when one is purchased for you. Often the drink will just be bought for you without even asking. Don't be surprised if someone who bought you a drink earlier in the night, later says that it is your shout. Not joining a shout can be awkward in some groups. The best way is to say you are driving, and you will buy your own drinks. This is also an acceptable way to drop out after one round, when the score is even.\\n\\n===Non-alcoholic===\\n'''Milo''' is a malt and chocolate drink now made by Nestl\\u00e9 that was invented in Australia, and has since become immensely popular in parts of [[Southeast Asia]]. It can be found in any Australian supermarket.\\n\\nAustralia has a strong '''[[coffee]]''' culture, especially [[Melbourne]], a city with extensive Italian immigration. The joke is that Italians visiting Melbourne think the coffee is worse than their home city's, but better than every other city in Italy. Even service stations and fast food places will sell decent coffee. However, because of the strong preference for local coffee shops, many of the major chains in other countries don't exist \\u2014 Starbucks has a tiny handful of stores in Melbourne and Sydney, and none elsewhere in the country. Don't be taken aback by the lack of chains; try the local flavour instead!\\n\\n'''[[Tea]]''' is much less popular than coffee in Australia, but is nevertheless not hard to find; most places that sell coffee also sell tea. There are some high-end hotels that serve traditional English afternoon tea, while Devonshire tea is a fairly popular weekend pastime among Australians, with numerous bakeries serving it. [[Queensland]] is also home to small tea-growing industry.\\n\\n==Learn==\\n{{Main|Studying abroad#Australia}}\\n\\nAustralia is a popular destination for University students, especially from [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[India]]. Australia offers world class universities in an English speaking environment, along with potential opportunities to actually gain resident and work visas on a path to citizenship. If you are intending to study in Australia, you will need to be on a visa class that allows this. Students and academics invited to visit Australian universities will generally also need an appropriate visa, even if their visit is of a short enough period to be covered by a tourist electronic visa. For very short term or part-time courses, check with your Australian consulate or embassy.\\n\\nAustralia also happens to be a great place to get barista certification, with graduates being maybe able to command higher wages in coffee shops back in their home countries. Such courses can usually be conducted on a standard tourist visa.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n[[File:Camping by the Yarrangobilly River - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Camping by the Yarrangobilly River, NSW]]\\nAccommodation is readily available in most Australian cities and tourist destinations. As with everything else in Australia, it tends to be on the expensive side by international standards.\\n\\n===Hotels===\\n{{infobox|When is a hotel not a hotel?|In Australian English, a '''hotel''' can also refer to what most of the rest of the world would call a '''pub'''. While country hotels (pubs) tend to have accommodation on site, most city hotels do not. A country hotel that does not have a public bar is typically called a '''motel'''.}}\\n\\nAll state capitals have a number of 4 or 5 star standard hotels, often with upmarket restaurants, bars, room-service, and other premium hospitality services. Expect to pay around $400/night, although prices can shoot through the stratosphere or straight up sell out during major concerts or events, such as New Year's Eve in Sydney.  Other 2 or 3 star hotels are scattered around the inner-cities and inner suburbs.\\n\\nThe usual international chains are reasonably well represented, with Accor having a particularly solid presence across the entire price spectrum.  Major independent local chains include [https://www.rydges.com/ Rydges].\\n\\n===Pubs===\\n[[File:BendigoShamrockHotel.JPG|thumb|Bendigo's Shamrock Hotel]]\\nMost pubs in Australia offer some form of accommodation. It can vary from very basic shabby rooms, to newly renovated boutique accommodation. The price is usually a good reflection of what you are in for. It is still quite unusual to have a private bathroom, even in the nicer pubs. The rooms are often on the second floor directly above the bar area and can be noisy, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.\\n\\nOutside of the major centres, the pub is called a '''hotel'''. A motel won't have a public bar. A motel that does have a bar attached is called a hotel/motel.\\n\\nIn very small towns local pubs offer the only accommodation available to travellers. Accommodation in these pubs tends to be budget-style with shared bathrooms but private rooms.\\n\\nPub accommodation is even available in the centre of [[Sydney]], making getting back to your room after a beer a simple endeavour.\\n\\nIf you travel as a single, and want a private room, pubs usually have single rooms at a discount over a double room. Most motels will charge the same price for one or two people sharing a room.\\n\\n===Motels===\\nTypically, motel-style accommodation will have a private room with a bed or number of beds, and a private shower and toilet. Many motels have family rooms, that will usually have a double bed and two single beds in the one room.\\n\\nMotel rooms in the cities will generally cost upwards from $100. Usually the cost is the same for one or two adults, with any extra people charged an additional fee. Prices for additional children can range from free to $20 per child. During quiet times its not unusual for motels to offer standby discounts.\\n\\nMost motels will serve a cooked or continental breakfast to your room in the morning, for an additional charge. Some may have a restaurant or serve an evening meal. Some may have a toaster in the room and kettles are widely provided.\\n\\n===Hostels and backpackers===\\n[[Hostels|Budget hostel-style accommodation]] with shared bathrooms and often with dormitories is approximately $20\\u201330 per person per night. Facilities usually include a fully equipped kitchen with adequate refrigeration and food storage areas. Most hostels also have living room areas equipped with couches, dining tables, and televisions.\\n\\nThere are several backpacker hostel chains in Australia. If you are staying many nights in the same brand of hostel, consider their discount cards, which usually offer a loyalty bonus on accommodation, and other attraction and tour discounts negotiated by the chain.\\n\\n===Holiday parks===\\nHoliday parks are an Australian holiday institution and a great way to stay if you have your own wheels. These are basically an upgraded version of '''caravan parks''', but as the new marketing indicates, they now cater to regular travellers as well. A typical holiday park offers the following types of accommodation:\\n\\n* '''Cabins''' fully equipped with bedding, kitchens, TV, Wi-Fi and more, for travellers without their own home on wheels. Most can house 4 or more people with rates starting from around $100/night.\\n* '''Powered sites''' for parking your caravan/campervan/motorhome/RV. Some parks offer '''en-suite sites''' featuring a little bathroom with a shower and toilet.\\n* '''Unpowered sites''' are for those intending to pitch their own tent, starting from around $20/night.\\n\\nRegardless of where you stay, the price includes access to communal facilities including BBQs, showers, kitchens, self-service laundries, pools, tennis courts and jumping pillows. The largest park chains covering the country are [https://topparks.com.au Top Parks/Discovery Parks] and [https://www.big4.com.au/ Big 4], but there are also plenty of independent options.\\n\\nThere are a couple of caveats to holiday parks:\\n\\n* They're typically located on the outskirts of towns, so they're not very practical unless you have your vehicle.\\n* Most cater to families, which is great if you have kids, but not so much if you're looking for peace and quiet.\\n* During school holidays, parks tend to jack up their rates and require multiple-night minimum stays, and the best ones sell out anyway.\\n* If you change your mind, too bad, since reservations are typically non-refundable.\\n\\n===Camping===\\nCamping is a popular pastime. In addition to camping at [[#Holiday parks|holiday parks]], national parks often provide cheap or free camping sites, which expect you to be more self-sufficient. Often toilets are provided and sometimes cold showers. Paid camping permits are sometimes required at popular parks, with some popular spots filling up during the holidays in summer. In Australia it is common to be within an hour's drive of a national park or recreation area that will permit some form of camping, even in the capital cities. Expect to pay around $5\\u201310 per night per person for a camping permit, and national park admission fees in the more popular national parks (e.g.: Wilsons Promontory National Park, Kosciuszko National Park, etc.), however entry and camping is free in the majority of national parks further from population and tourist centres.\\n\\nSome other camping areas are run by government or even local landowners. Expect around $10 per person per night, depending on the time of year.\\n\\nYou can try your luck sleeping on a beach or pitching a tent overnight in a highway rest area, or out in the bush for a free bed. Most rest areas and beaches prohibit camping and many even prohibit overnight parking to discourage this. Generally the closer you are to civilization or a tourist area, the greater the chance of being hassled by the authorities.\\n\\nCamping in state forests is often preferable to national parks if you're after a camping experience over sightseeing, as collecting of your own fire wood is allowed (sometimes felling of trees is permissible dependent on the area) and camping is not restricted to camp sites. Some other activities that are generally allowed in state forests that are not allowed in national parks are: bringing in dogs/pets, open fires, motorbikes and four-wheel driving. State forests are generally free to stay in, although you will need to check locally if public access is allowed.\\n\\n[[Car camping|Camping in RVs]] is a popular pastime for Australians, and many campsites are equipped for RVs and caravans, though they may or may not have power supply and mains water connections. The number of RV and caravan parking slots can be limited, so check if you can reserve a slot.\\n\\n===Farm stay===\\nMuch as the name suggests, this usually involves a cabin or homestead accommodation on a working property. Suited for a stay of two or more days, this accommodation usually allows you to get a little involved in the running of the farm if you wish. It is common for dinner to be provided in the homestead, and a breakfast pack to be provided to your cabin.\\n\\n===Holiday home===\\nHoliday homes are homes rented by their owners, often using local real estate agents or specialised web sites. Sometimes located in prime positions, but also sometimes in the residential sections of cities and towns. Minimum rental periods of at least 2 days usually apply, rising to a week during periods when they are busy. At a minimum will have bedrooms, a lounge, bathroom.\\n\\n===[[Bed and Breakfasts]]===\\n[[File:HentyCentralHotel.JPG|thumb|250px|The Henty Central Hotel in the New South Wales town of Henty provides bed and breakfast accommodation. Many country towns have similar hotels.]]\\nBed and Breakfasts tend to be a premium form of accommodation in Australia, often focused on weekend accommodation for couples. They certainly don't offer the discount form of accommodation they do in part of the [[United Kingdom]], and the local motel will usually be cheaper.\\n\\nSometimes extra rooms in a person's home, but often a purpose built building. You should expect a cosy, well kept room, a common area, and a cooked breakfast. Possibly private facilities. Substantial discounts often apply for mid-week stays at bed and breakfasts.\\n\\n===Resorts===\\nThere are many true resorts around Australia. Many have lagoon pools, tennis, golf, kids clubs, and other arranged activities. The island of the [[Whitsundays]] have a choice of resorts, some occupying entire islands. [[Port Douglas]] also has many resorts of a world standard.\\n\\n===Serviced apartments===\\nServiced apartments are a very popular form of accommodation in Australia, and they can be found across the country in city centres, beach towns and ski resorts alike. Guests are typically able to stay for as little as one night, and discounts are often available for bookings of a week and over.  Rooms tend to be larger than in standard hotels, and amenities typically include a kitchen, washer and dryer, and separate bedrooms, which make these a cost-effective option particularly for families or larger groups.\\n\\nApartment hotels generally don't offer breakfast or have a restaurant, but there are usually cafes located nearby (often next door) which cater to guests.  Major chains include [https://www.meritonsuites.com.au/ Meriton Suites] and [https://adinahotels.com/en/ Adina].\\n\\n===Houseboats===\\n\\nHouseboats are available to rent on some scenic rural rivers, and provide an excellent opportunity to spend time in the wilderness. These usually have kitchens in them so you can bring your own food to cook.\\n\\n===Station wagons and vans===\\nIn most parts of Australia it is illegal to sleep in your vehicle but it is possible to get around this by simply rigging up curtains all around the windows so no one can see in from the outside. Trade vans can be picked up for as little as $1,000, with a more trustworthy van setting you back no more than $3,000-4,000. Add a mattress, pillow, portable gas cooker, cookware and a 20 L water container and you are off. If you get caught the fine could be as much as $150 each, so do it at you own risk. But if you are strategic in where you stay you probably won't get caught. Just be sensible and don't disturb the locals. Also, be aware of parking restrictions in certain parts of the cities and town, although overnight parking restrictions are rare. The parking inspectors can be ruthless and a $100+ fine is not uncommon.\\n\\nAll cities and towns in Australia have free public toilets. Many parks, and most beaches have free electric barbecues as well. Popular beaches have fresh water showers to wash the salt water off after you swim, so for those on a tight budget (or for those that just love waking up at the beach) simply wash in the ocean (please do not pollute the ocean or waterways by using detergents or soaps) and rinse off at the showers. Almost all taps in Australia are drinking water, the ones that aren't will be marked. Service stations (petrol/gas) almost always have taps, so these are a good place to refill the water containers each time you refuel.\\n\\nSome of the best experiences you may have in Australia will be by taking that road on the map that looks like it heads to a beach, creek, waterfall or mountain and following it. You may just find paradise and not another soul in sight. And lucky you, you've got a bed, food and water right there with you.\\n\\nTravelling in a small group lowers the fuel bill per head, as this will likely be your biggest expense.\\n\\nEnjoy, and respect the land by taking your rubbish/bottles/cigarette butts with you and disposing of them properly.\\n\\n==Work==\\nAustralian citizens, New Zealand citizens and permanent residents of Australia can work in Australia without any further permits, but others will require a work visa. It is illegal for foreigners to undertake paid work in Australia on a tourist visa. Be aware that any form of compensation for services performed, monetary or otherwise (e.g. room and board), counts as payment in Australia, meaning that such work would be illegal on a tourist visa. Volunteer work is allowed provided it is incidental to the trip (i.e. not the main purpose for the trip). Foreigners in Australia on a student visa are allowed to work for up to 20 hours a week during term time, and full-time during the school holidays. Working illegally in Australia runs a very real risk of arrest, imprisonment, deportation and being permanently banned from re-entering Australia. All visitors who do not hold Australian permanent residency or citizenship (including New Zealand citizens who aren't also Australian permanent residents or citizens) are not allowed to access Australian social security arrangements for the unemployed, and will have limited, or more usually, no access to the Australian government's health care payment arrangements.\\n\\n===Payment and taxes===\\nMost Australian employers pay via direct deposit to Australian bank accounts and therefore you should open a bank account as soon as possible. Some banks allow you to open account from abroad, for example Commonwealth Bank and HSBC.\\n\\nYou should also apply for a '''[http://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-file-number/ Tax File Number (TFN)]''' as soon as possible. You can apply on-line for free at the [http://www.ato.gov.au/ Australian Tax Office website], though you can generally get it quicker if you just go to one of their offices. You can start working without one, but you are advised to get one as soon as possible as your employer would have to withhold tax from your salary at the highest rate should you not provide one. Register your TFN with your bank as soon as possible, otherwise any interest you accrue will be taxed at the highest rate. The Australian financial year runs from 1st July to 30th June, and tax returns for each financial year are due on 30th October, four months after the accounting period ends. Check with Australian tax agents about Australian tax liability and filing an Australian tax return. A return can be filed relatively painlessly by creating a [https://my.gov.au/ myGov] account and linking it with the ATO (you may need to call the ATO for help linking your account if you don't have the right Australian-issued ID).\\n\\nAlong with your taxes, the ATO will collect a '''[https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-and-private-health-insurance/Medicare-levy/ Medicare levy]''', 2% of your income which is used to fund the Australian public healthcare system. Some foreign workers are exempt from the levy; if that applies to you, make sure to apply for a [https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/medicare-entitlement-statement Medicare Entitlement Statement] so you can use it to get a refund. Apply early, as the statement can take time to issue and you need it when lodging your tax return.\\n\\nAustralian employers will make compulsory payments out of your earnings to an Australian superannuation (retirement savings) fund on your behalf. Visitors on temporary working visas who are not citizens of Australia or New Zealand should claim this money when they leave Australia. This payment is known as a Departing Australia Superannuation Payment (DASP) and you can [https://applicant.tr.super.ato.gov.au/applicants/default.aspx?pid=1 apply online]. New Zealand citizens can transfer their superannuation money to their New Zealand KiwiSaver account; contact your provider to arrange this.\\n\\n===Working holidaymaker scheme===\\n[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 4714 CSIRO Precision Viticulture Trial site in the Eden Valley SA March 2004.jpg|thumb|Vineyards in South Australia]]\\nAustralia has a working holidaymaker program for citizens of certain countries between 18 and 30 years of age. It allows you to stay in Australia for 12 months from the time you first enter. You may work during that time, but only for 6 months at any one employer. The idea is for you to take a holiday subsidised by casual or short-term jobs. If you're interested in a working holiday, some useful skills and experience might be: office skills to be used for temp work; or hospitality skills to be used for bar or restaurant work. An alternative is seasonal work like fruit picking, although much seasonal work will require that you work outside the major cities. Working for 3 months in seasonal work will allow you to apply for a second 12-month visa.\\n\\nYou can apply online for a '''[https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/work-holiday-417 working holiday visa]''', but you must ''not'' be in Australia at the time. It costs $635 (as of April 2024). According to the department, half are processed within 1 day, and 90% of applications are processed within three weeks. On arriving in Australia ask for the working holiday visa to be \\\"evidenced\\\", so you can show your future employer.\\n\\nIt's recommended to arrive in Australia with sufficient funds which is a minimum of $5000 if you are on a working holiday visa. The cost of living in Australia is quite high and it may take a few days or weeks to get a job.\\n\\n===Work visas===\\nWork visas in Australia change frequently and sometimes without any notice, so always check with your local Australian High Commission, Consulate or Embassy and the [http://www.immi.gov.au/ Immigration Department's website].\\n\\nThe most straightforward way to get a work visa (subclass 457, 186 & 187) is to find an Australian employer who will sponsor you. Your employer will need to demonstrate that they cannot hire anyone with your skills in Australia. Locally advertised jobs are usually explicit in requiring a valid work visa before your application can be considered. Getting the visa might take a couple of months from the beginning of the application process and you will need a medical examination by a doctor approved by the immigration officials before it can be granted (among other things, you will need a chest x-ray to show that you do not have tuberculosis). An employer with a good background and efficient immigration lawyers could get your 457 approved within a week. Your work visa will only be valid for the employer who sponsored you and you will have to leave within 30 days of your employment ending.\\n\\nRegional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) visa (subclass 187) is the easiest employer nominated visa to acquire, although you will have to live and work in a designated 'regional' area. These areas are mostly rural and far removed from the larger cities, although [[Adelaide]] does count in this scheme.\\n\\nSkilled independent visas (subclass 189, 190, 489) may be pursued if you have a valuable specialised skill and don't want to be tied to a specific employer.\\n\\nThere is also a temporary graduate visa (subclass 485) which allows graduates of Australian universities to stay on and work in Australia, and is usually valid anywhere from 18 months to 4 years depending on your level of education, and your major. Your major must be from a list of skilled occupations for which there is a labour shortage in Australia. This list is updated every year, and whether or not you qualify for this visa is dependent on the list at the time of your graduation, ''not'' at the time you begin your studies.\\n\\n===Immigration===\\nYou can apply to immigrate as a skilled person or business person, but this process will take longer than receiving a work visa. You can also apply for permanent residency as the holder of a work or study visa, but your application will not be automatically accepted. If you have a lot of money, there are several investor's visas available which allow you to live in Australia with a view of obtaining permanent residency. After four years of legal residency which must include one year as a permanent resident, you are eligible to apply for Australian citizenship.\\n\\n===Volunteering===\\nThere are several volunteer opportunities in Australia. Many worldwide organisations offer extended travel for those wanting to volunteer their time to work with locals on projects such as habitat restoration, wildlife sanctuary maintenance & development, scientific research, and education programs such as [http://www.australianvolunteers.com '''Australian Volunteers'''], [http://www.wwf.org.au '''World Wildlife Fund'''], [http://www.gap360.com '''Gap 360'''] and '''[https://xtremegapyear.co.uk/ Xtreme Gap Year].'''\\n\\n==Respect==\\n{{infobox|The Australian protocol|Pretty much every customer service interaction you have in Australia, be it with a barista or bartender or hotel receptionist or taxi driver, will start with some variation of this:\\n* You: Hey, how ya going?\\n* Them: Good thanks, yourself?\\n* You: I'd like a flat white/a schooner of Fat Yak/a room for two/to go to Toowoomba...\\nYes, this applies to people you've never seen before in your life, and yes, after these two lines, you can launch straight into your actual request without telling your own life story.  But don't try to skip it completely, or people will think you're a bit rude.}}\\n\\nTravellers are generally unlikely to insult or cause offence to an Australian through any kind of cultural ignorance.\\n\\nAustralian modes of address tend towards the familiar. It is acceptable and normal to use first names in all situations, even to people many years your senior. Many Australians are fond of using and giving nicknames \\u2014 even to recent acquaintances. It is likely being called such a name is an indication that you are considered a friend and as such it would be rare they are being condescending.\\n\\nIt is generally acceptable to wear revealing clothing in Australia. Bikinis and swimming attire are okay on the beach, and usually at the kiosk across the road from the beach. It is normal to wear at least a shirt and footwear before venturing any further. Most beaches are effectively top optional (topless) while sunbathing. Just about all women wear a top while walking around or in the water. There are some clothing optional (nude) beaches, usually a little further removed from residential areas. Thong bikinis (more commonly called g-string bikinis in Australia as thongs refer to flip-flop footwear) are fine on all beaches and some outdoor pools for women and men, although they are not as common as conventional beachwear. Some outdoor pools have a \\\"top required\\\" policy for women. \\n\\nCover up a little more when visiting places of worship such as churches. In warm conditions casual \\\"t-shirt and shorts\\\" style clothing predominates except in formal situations. Business attire, however, is considered to be long sleeved shirt, tie, and long trousers for men, even in the hottest weather.\\n\\nUsing [[Australian slang|Australian stereotypical expressions]] may be viewed as an attempt to mock, rather than to communicate. If you pull it off well, you might raise a smile.\\n\\nAustralians are often self-deprecating; however, it is rude to ever agree with a self-deprecating remark. Boasting about achievements is rarely received well.\\n\\nSocial classes do not feature as prominently in Australia as they do in many other countries, and you will notice that tradespeople (\\\"tradies\\\") and manual labourers are very well paid and accorded a lot more respect in Australia than elsewhere. Be careful not to imply that you are looking down on people whose jobs may be considered menial by the standards of other countries. Service workers, including hotel staff, waiters, cleaners, taxi drivers and shop employees, expect that customers will treat them as equals.\\n\\nMost Australians are happy to help out a lost traveller with directions, however many urban dwellers will assume that someone asking \\\"excuse me\\\", is asking for money, and may brush past. Looking lost, holding a map, looking like a backpacker or getting to the point quickly helps.\\n\\n===Indigenous Australians ===\\n[[File:Ayers Rock 2004 - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|Ulu\\u1e5fu]]\\n[[Indigenous Australian culture|Aboriginal Australians]] likely arrived in the Australian landmass 65,000 years ago and number over half a million people today. They have faced significant discrimination over the years since European settlement took their traditional lands, and sensitivity should be given at all times. Aboriginal people actually come from many different 'nations' with distinctive cultures and identities that spoke up to 250 different languages before European settlement.\\n\\nFor travellers, Aboriginal lands have varying degrees of accessibility. While many areas can be entered freely, some Aboriginal land requires permission or a permit, and some areas are protected and illegal to enter. Permits are usually just a formality for areas which regularly see visitors, or if you have some other business in the area you are travelling through. Often they are just an agreement to respect the land you are travelling on as Aboriginal land. Some Aboriginal Land Councils make them available online.\\n\\nSome communities and areas have placed sign requests from Aboriginal people not to enter. While tourism is welcome and beneficial to Aboriginal communities, efforts are ongoing to balance cultural tourism with cultural preservation, separating living spaces from tourist spaces, and respecting sites of worship. Even if your map states that an area is \\\"free to enter\\\", failure to abide by these requests is highly disrespectful and could also be considered trespassing. You should check before making plans to travel off the beaten track to confirm whether your intended destination is welcoming to tourists and whether a permit is necessary to avoid problems.\\n\\n[[Ulu\\u1e5fu]], Australia's most well-known natural landmark, holds great spiritual significance to the Anangu people who live in the area; while climbing it used to be a popular tourist activity, the Anangu have long requested tourists not to do so, and it has been illegal since 2019. The Anangu feel themselves responsible if someone is killed or injured on their land (as has happened during past climbs), so please keep off. The name \\\"Ayers Rock\\\" is frequently used for Uluru overseas however it is almost never used within Australia itself and it is not recommended to refer to Uluru by this name.\\n\\nIf you need to refer to race, the politically correct term is ''Indigenous Australians''. ''Aboriginal people'' is usually okay and referring to sacred sites and land as Aboriginal sites, or Aboriginal land is okay too, though these terms only refer to people indigenous to mainland Australia or Tasmania. Avoid using ''Aboriginal'' as a noun to describe a person, as some people see negative connotations in this. The terms \\\"Aborigine\\\" or \\\"Abo\\\" are deeply offensive and should never be used. The word ''native'' generally not a preferred term, but reasonably acceptable \\u2013 just use ''indigenous'' instead. People indigenous to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] do not identify as \\\"Aboriginal\\\", as they are more ethnically Melanesian than their southern neighbours; just stick to the term ''Torres Strait Islander''.\\n\\nOther areas to consider when interacting with indigenous Australians are:\\n\\n* Australia Day is considered a day of invasion by many Aboriginal people, and consequently protests against that day are frequent.\\n* It is best not to mention the name, nor show any image of a deceased person to an indigenous Australian. Though Aboriginal custom varies, it is best to avoid the possibility of offence.\\n* Permission to photograph an Aboriginal person should always be asked, but in particular in the more remote areas such as [[Arnhem Land]] and [[Northern Territory]].\\n* Avoid disrespecting sacred Aboriginal places like climbing on Ulu\\u1e5fu or the Three Sisters etc. While this may sound obvious that it's disrespectful, the number of indigenous sites that have been damaged, vandalised, or even destroyed by tourists is unimaginable.\\n* While indigenous Australians have been given equal rights on paper, they are still often arrested or hassled by police for things that a non-indigenous person wouldn't usually get arrested for. Talking about this subject may be highly sensitive, and to this day, there are regular reports in the media of Aboriginal people being assaulted by police or dying in police custody. In fact, despite comprising a little under 4% of the Australian population, indigenous men make up nearly 30% of the Australian male prison population. These topics should be '''avoided whenever possible'''.\\n\\n===ANZAC Day===\\nAlthough Australians are generally regarded as easy going, there is an exception for commemorating ANZAC day on 25th April every year. Many Australians will take extreme offence at any perceived insults towards the military and the sacrifices they made, and foreigners have even been arrested for damaging or even just playing around on war memorials. Most people will accept criticism of Australia any other time of the year, but not this day.\\n\\n===Religion===\\nContemporary Australian society is rather secular, and only a minority of Australians attend religious services regularly. In the 2021 census, only 43% of respondents identified as Christian, with 38% declaring they had no religion at all. Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism are growing religions, with immigration helping to drive the trend. \\n\\nMost Australians are tolerant towards people of all faiths, and people wearing religious attires such as hijabs, kippahs or crucifixes will in general not face harassment, although Islamophobia, antisemitism and other types of religious discrimination do exist. In general people tend not to discuss religion, and attempting to proselytise or inconveniencing others with your religion will more often than not result in a negative response. \\n\\nAccommodating Halal dietary restrictions is largely possible in the main cities with many restaurants offering Halal options, with various certification bodies. Large supermarkets also offer Halal sections.\\n\\n===British legacy===\\nIt can be offensive to some to suggest that Australia is nothing else but a sunnier United Kingdom. Comparisons to the UK are not necessarily offensive, but people will appreciate being acknowledged as a separate nation with their own distinct culture.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Emergencies===\\nThe number '''[tel:000 000]''' (called 'triple zero' or 'triple oh') can be dialled from any telephone in Australia free of charge. This number will connect you with the police, fire brigade, coastguard or ambulance service after you tell the emergency operator which service you need.\\n\\nIf you want to contact these services but the situation is not an emergency, don't call 000: you can call the police assistance line on [tel:131444 131 444]. This includes requesting a call out for noise complaints. Poisons information advice, which can also advise on snake, spider and insect bites, is available on [tel:131126 131 126]. Information on locating the nearest medical services can be obtained by calling [tel:1800022222 1800 022 222] (except for Tasmania).\\n\\nIf you require assistance during a flood, storm, cyclone, tsunami, earthquake or other natural disaster you can contact the State Emergency Service in each state (except for Northern Territory) on [tel:132500 132 500]. You will be connected with your local unit and help can be organised from there. If the emergency is life-threatening, call 000 instead.\\n\\nYou can dial 000 from all mobile phones. Mobile phones sold in Australia recognise it as the emergency number and will use any available network to place the call. However, if you have a phone obtained outside Australia, using the universal emergency number '''[tel:112 112]''' is a better idea. Using 112 will use any available network, will work even if your phone is not roaming, and will work even if the phone does not have a SIM. 112 works from Australian purchased phones too. Starting from the 28th of October 2024 there will no longer be a 3G network, and your phone will need to support not only VoLTE calling, but also emergency calls over VoLTE (some phones are hard coded to use 3G or 2G instead); it can be hard to establish whether a given phone is compatible without dialling 000 (which should only be done in an emergency), though if it works with an Australian SIM you should be fine.\\n\\nHearing or speech impaired people with TTY equipment can dial '''[tel:106 106]'''. Those with Internet connectivity can use the [http://www.relayservice.com.au Internet Relay Service, via the website].\\n\\nCalls from fixed line (landline) phones may be traced to assist the emergency services to reach you. The emergency services have limited ability to trace the origin of emergency calls from mobile phones, especially outside of urban areas, so be sure to calmly and clearly provide details of your location. Because of the number sequence for emergency calls, around 60% of calls to the emergency numbers are made in error.\\n\\nNobody will likely respond to your call unless you can effectively communicate to the operator that you need assistance. If you are in need of assistance, but cannot speak, you will be diverted to an IVR and asked to press '''55''' to confirm that you are in need of assistance and have not called by accident. Your call will then be connected to the police.\\n\\nExcept for 112 from a mobile, emergency numbers from other countries (for example, '911', '17' or '100') '''do not work''' in Australia.\\n\\n===Driving===\\n{{seealso|Driving in Australia}}\\n\\nKeep a sense of perspective. Tourists are far more likely to be killed or injured as pedestrians, drivers or passengers on Australian roads than all the other causes of death and injury combined.\\n\\nDriving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is prohibited. Most states use a prescribed standard of alcohol in the blood to determine whether driving is criminal. The prescribed (allowed) content ranges from zero to 0.05. Random breath testing for blood and alcohol is carried out.\\n\\nAustralia is a huge country and driving between cities and towns can take longer than you expect, especially if you are used to freeway or motorway driving in Europe, Asia or North America. While the major highways are comparable to those overseas, secondary highways in rural areas need to be treated with some care. Speed limits vary by location, road and by state. Avoid the stresses of fatigue by not planning to drive too far in a day. Authorities strongly recommend a break (with some walking outside the car) every two hours. Often, there are designated rest stops on numbered M, A routes as well as National Highways and Routes, but they are almost non existent on unpaved highways, state routes, B or C highways.\\n\\nDriving between towns and cities comes with a risk of hitting or crashing due to swerving to avoid wildlife. Kangaroos have a habit of being spooked by cars and then, bewilderingly, jumping in front of them. Take extra care when driving through areas with vegetation close to the road and during dawn and dusk when wildlife is most active. Wildlife is not usually an issue in major urban areas (with the exception of Canberra where a series of parks provides ample habitat for kangaroos, which often cross major roads).\\n\\nUrban Australians jaywalk, dodge cars, and anticipate the sequence of lights. Although most drivers will stop for a red light, running the amber light is common, so ensuring the traffic has stopped before stepping from the curb is always a good idea. People from countries that drive on the right will take a while to get used to looking the correct way when crossing.\\n\\n===Beaches===\\n[[File:Lifeguard, Sydney, Australia.jpg|thumb|A lifeguard at Bondi Beach in Sydney]]\\n<!-- There are links to this section from other beach going sections in Australia city and district articles.\\n Please leave this heading intact, unless there is a good reason to change it.\\n Please add information here that is common to beaches across Australia\\n-->\\nAround 10\\u201320 overseas travellers drown in Australia each year. Most of these drownings occur at ocean beaches, where statistics put visitors at significantly higher risk than locals. Check the [http://www.beachsafe.org.au Beach Safety website].\\n\\nBeach goers should '''swim between the red and yellow flags''' which designate patrolled areas. Beaches are not patrolled 24-hours a day or even during all daylight hours. In most cases the local volunteer surf lifesavers or professional lifeguards are only available during certain hours, and at some beaches only on weekends, and often only during summer. If the flags aren't up, then there's no one patrolling. Many beaches in rural areas aren't patrolled at all. If you choose to swim, be aware of the risks, check conditions, stay within your depth, and don't swim alone.\\n\\nMany beaches in Australia have a sudden drop off which can take non-swimmers by surprise. If in doubt, ask the locals.\\n\\nHard surfboards and other water craft such as surf skis, kayaks etc., are '''not''' permitted between the red and yellow flags. These craft must only be used outside of the blue 'surfcraft permitted' flags.\\n\\nAustralian ocean beaches can sometimes have strong rips that even the strongest swimmers cannot swim against. Rips are almost-invisible channels of water flowing away from the beach. Many locals can spot rips, so if in doubt, ask. These channels take out the water which the incoming surf waves bring into shore. Beach goers can mistakenly use these channels or areas since they can appear as calm water and look to be an easier area into which to swim. Problems arise when the swimmer tries to swim back into shore against the outgoing current or rip, tire quickly, and end up drowning. Rips can be recognised by one or more of these signs: a rippled appearance when the surrounding water is fairly calm; foam that extends beyond the break zone; brown, sandy coloured water; waves breaking further out on either side of the rip.\\n\\nIf you are caught in a rip at a patrolled beach, conserve your energy, float or tread water and raise one hand. The surf lifesavers will come out to you. Don't wait until you are so tired you can't swim any more. You will probably find that local swimmers or surfers will also quickly come to your aid. Usually the flags are positioned where there are no rips, but this isn't always the case as rips can move.\\n\\nIf you are caught in a rip at an unpatrolled beach stay calm to conserve energy and swim '''parallel''' to the beach (not against the pull of the current). Most rips are only a few metres wide, and once clear of the undertow, you will be able to swim or catch a wave to return to shore. '''Never swim alone.''' Don't think that the right technique will get you out of every situation. In the surf out the back of the beach, treading water can be hard with waves pounding you every few seconds. Unless you have seen it happen, it's hard to appreciate how quickly a rip can take you 50 m out to sea and into much larger wave breaks. If you are at an unpatrolled surf beach, proceed with great caution and never go out of your depth.\\n\\nBeach signs often have a number or an alphanumeric code on them. This code can be given to emergency services if required so they can locate you quickly.\\n\\n[[#Crocodiles|Crocodiles]] and [[#Jellyfish|Box Jellyfish]] are found on tropical beaches, depending on the time of year and area. Sharks occur on many of Australia's beaches. See the section below on dangerous creatures. Patrolled beaches will be monitoring the ocean for any shark activity. If you hear a continuous siren go off at the beach and a red and a red and white quartered flag is waved or held out of the tower, it indicates a shark sighting, so make your way to shore. Once it is clear, a short blast of the siren will be sounded, which usually means that it is safe to return to the water.\\n\\n===Natural disasters===\\nAs a large country, Australia is affected by a range of natural disasters.\\n\\n====[[Cyclones]]====\\nTropical cyclones (hurricanes) occur in the tropics (the northern part) of Australia between November and April, and you should understand how a tropical cyclone may impact you during the tropical wet season. The impact of cyclones varies with their intensity and your proximity to them. Weak cyclones may just cost you a day or two of your holiday to rain and wind while you stay indoors in your hotel, and an hour's drive from the cyclone's centre can still have good weather. More severe tropical cyclones can be deadly to the unprepared, may force you to evacuate and can seriously disrupt your travel plans. Even low intensity cyclones or tropical depressions in more remote areas can close roads for days to weeks at a time.\\n\\nOn average, a town in the tropics experiences a tropical cyclone every 30 years or so. The sparseness of population in Australia's north and north-west (where cyclones are most prevalent) means that many cyclones pass the coast with little impact on towns.\\n\\nStill, if you are planning to travel to the tropics during cyclone season, you should understand and review the [http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/index.shtml Bureau of Meteorology's information page] before you set out, and keep a general eye on the page while you travel for early alerts of any problems developing.\\n\\n====Floods====\\nIn the tropical north the ''Wet Season'' occurs over the summer months of December, January and February, bringing torrential rains and frequent floods to those regions. It is not unusual for some coastal areas to be cut off for a day or two while the water recedes. It can still be a good time to visit some of the well populated, tourist-oriented areas, and, except in unusually heavy flooding, you can still get to see the pounding waterfalls and other attractions that can make this an interesting time to visit.\\n\\nFloods in outback and inland Australia are rare, occurring decades apart, so you would be unlucky to encounter them. However, if you are planning to visit the inland or the outback and the area is flooded, then you should reconsider. The land is flat, so the water can take weeks to move on, leaving the land boggy. Insects and mosquitoes go crazy with all the fresh water pooling around, and these things eat insect repellent for breakfast and are still hungry. Roads close, often adding many hours to driving times. Many attractions often lie on a short stretch of dirt road off the main highways, and these sections become impassable, even if the main road remains open. Plan to return in a few weeks, and the land will still be green, the lakes and rivers will still be flowing, and the bird life will still be around.\\n\\nThe wettest period for the south of the country is usually around the winter months of June, July, and August. There is rarely enough rain at one time to cause flooding. The capital cities are rarely, if ever, significantly affected by floods.\\n\\n====== Flash floods ======\\nFlash flooding occurs in many eastern cities at least once a year, generally in summer, and is a nuisance. However, stay inside and follow the advice of SES and ABC local radio. Never attempt to drive in flood waters, dozens of cars are destroyed every year when drivers underestimate the depth or ferocity of the floodwaters. You don't want to be the person floating under that bridge waiting for the police to rescue you.\\n\\nFlash flooding often brings large hail, which can damage cars. Seek undercover (not underground) car parking.\\n\\nIt is usually predictable. You'll generally hear grumblings about a storm coming from locals, and [http://www.bom.gov.au/ bom.gov.au] will list a severe weather warning.\\n\\n====Water supply====\\nAustralia is a very dry country with large areas of '''desert''', and can also get very hot.\\n\\nWhen travelling in remote areas, away from paved roads, where the potential to become stranded for up to a week without seeing another vehicle is very real, it is vital that you carry your own water supply (4 gal or 7 L per person per day). Do not be misled by entries on maps such as 'well' or 'spring' or 'tank' (or any entry suggesting that there is a body of water). Nearly all are dry, and most inland lakes are dry salt pans.\\n\\nMany cities and towns have water restrictions, limiting use of water in activities like washing cars, watering gardens, or public showers. It is common to see signs in accommodation asking visitors to limit the length of their showers.\\n\\nIt is common for many regional towns public bathrooms water supply to be non-potable. Do not drink from a tap labeled \\\"Do not drink\\\" or \\\"Non-potable\\\", as this is generally just untreated groundwater.\\n\\n====[[Earthquakes]]====\\nAlthough Australia is not located on any plate boundaries, earthquakes occur from time to time. These are usually minor and very rarely cause major damage or fatalities.\\n\\n===Bushfires===\\n\\n'''[[Wildfires|Bushfires]]''' are a seasonal danger in many parts of Australia - and if you're venturing out into the bushland or rural areas it pays to check the fire danger and the status of any bushfire activity first. Although most fires are quickly controlled, on very hazardous fire days, bushfires can be life-threatening - especially if on foot, or not having the protection of a substantial building.\\n\\nIf you are caught in a bushfire, most fires will pass over quickly. You need to find shelter that will protect you from the smoke and radiant heat. A house is best, then a car, then a clearing, a cave, or on the beach is the best location. Wet everything that you can. Stay low and cover your mouth. Cover yourself with non-flammable (woollen) clothing or blankets, and reduce the skin directly exposed to the heat. If you have access to a tap gather water early; don't rely on water pressure as the fire front approaches.\\n\\nThe Fire Danger Rating (pictured to the right) tells you how dangerous a fire would be if one started. '''It is not a predictor of how likely a bushfire is to occur.'''[[File:WA fire danger sign Wyalkatchem.jpg|thumb|Fire danger signs are located across Australia]]\\n\\n* Severe: Hot, dry and windy conditions. A fire that starts in these conditions may be uncontrollable. Only well prepared buildings that are actively defended can provide safety. Leave at the first sign of fire.\\n* Extreme: Hot dry and windy conditions. Any fires that start and take hold will be uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving. Only homes and buildings built to withstand bushfires that are well prepared and actively defended may provide safety. Avoid forested areas, thick bush or long, dry grass, It is recommended to leave such areas to ensure you are not caught up in a bushfire.\\n* Catastrophic/code red: These are the worst conditions possible for a bush or grass fire. Avoid forested areas, thick bush or long, dry grass. It is highly advisable to leave forested and bushy areas.\\nIt is worth noting that many locals will leave their outback homes to seek refuge in large towns for the entire day, on the few days per year designated as \\\"Catastrophic\\\".\\n\\n==== National parks and state forests ====\\n\\nIf the fire risk is extreme or higher, national parks may be closed, especially the backcountry areas, so you will need to have an alternative plan if you intend to camp or hike in parks during summer. If there is a fire in a park, it will usually be closed entirely.\\n\\nIf you are staying in a park or forest during an extreme fire danger period the safest option is to leave the night before or early in the day. If you learn of a fire, or see smoke, take action quickly.\\n\\n==== Travelling during active fires or during the fire season ====\\n\\nIf you are driving outside of cities during bushfire season, tune in to [https://www.abc.net.au/local/ local ABC radio]. During a bushfire or any other ongoing emergency, every thirty minutes a warning siren will sound, followed by an update on the current bushfire situation in that area. You may receive evacuation warnings on your phone.\\n\\nEmergency and bushfire management is a state responsibility in Australia - so find the website or app appropriate for the state you are in. Websites such as [https://www.emergency.wa.gov.au/ Emergency WA] and [https://emergency.vic.gov.au/ VicEmergency] list all current emergencies in their respective states and are often the most up-to-date method of getting information about a current emergency.\\n\\n'''It is possible that you will get yourself into a situation where it becomes too late to leave.'''\\n\\nDuring the bushfire season, have a plan consisting of two escape routes, and the ability to pack what you need quickly.\\n\\nShopping Centres or Main streets of built up towns are safe locations to be in during Extreme or Code Red days, unless you hear otherwise via radio.\\n\\nEntire country towns can sometimes be evacuated when there is a bushfire threatening them. Often there can be no signs of the fire at evacuation time, but you should leave early, as evacuating through a fire front is dangerous. The best advice is just to move on, and not stay around to watch.\\n\\n==== Lighting fires ====\\nMake sure any fires you light are legal and kept under control. The fire service operates a '''total fire ban''' system during periods of extreme fire danger. When a total fire ban is in place all outdoor fires are forbidden. Most parks will advertise a ban, and it is your responsibility to check the local fire danger levels. In National Parks, park rangers or police will patrol during total fire ban days to ensure no naked flames are lit. Fines or even jail terms apply for lighting fires that get out of control.\\n\\n===Venomous and dangerous creatures===\\n{{see also|Pests}}\\nAlthough Australia is home to many of the deadliest species of insects, reptiles and marine life on the planet, the traveller is unlikely to encounter any of these in an urban environment, and even in the bush these creatures try to avoid humans for the most part. The vast majority of deaths from bites and stings in Australia are due to allergic reactions to bees and wasps.\\n\\nSome of the information spread about Australia's dangerous wildlife is blown out of proportion, often jokingly by Australians themselves. However, you should take warnings about jellyfish and crocodiles seriously in the tropics, and keep your distance from snakes in the national parks and bushland.\\n\\nIf travelling in rural areas it would be a good idea to carry basic first aid equipment including compression bandages and to learn what to do after a snake or spider bite.\\n\\n====Snakes ====\\n\\nIt's not common to encounter snakes in urbanised areas in Australia, but they are common in grassland, national parks and other bushland. Snakes will generally try to put as much distance between themselves and you as possible, so if you see a snake while out walking, simply go around it or walk the other way. Walking blindly into dense bush and grassy areas is not advisable, as snakes may be hiding there. For the most part, snakes fear humans and will be long gone before you ever get the chance to see them.\\n\\n'''Never''' try to pick up any snake, even if you believe it to be a non-venomous species. Most people bitten by snakes were trying to pick up the snake or kill the creature, or inadvertently step on one while out walking.\\n\\nAustralia has some snakes that are deadly. So treat all snakes with respect, and seek medical treatment urgently for any snake bite. Take a first-aid kit suitable for snake-bites if you are going off the beaten track. If bitten you should immobilise the wound by wrapping the affected area tightly with strips of clothing or bandages and seek immediate medical help. Do not clean the wound as venom residues can be tested to determine the anti-venom to use. If you are in an isolated area send someone else for help. The venom of some snakes (the taipan in particular) can take effect within fifteen minutes, but if the wound is immediately immobilised and you rest it is possible to delay the onset of the venom spreading by one to a few hours. Polyvalent anti-venoms are available in most hospitals that contain anti-venom for all dangerous Australian snakes.\\n\\n====Spiders====\\n\\n[[File:Atrax robustus.jpg|thumb|Sydney funnel-web spider in a warning posture]]\\nAlthough famous for its arachnids, fatalities from spiders in Australia are extremely rare. It is common to see spiders in Australia, and most will do you no harm. Wear gloves while gardening or handling leaf litter. Check or shake out clothing, shoes, etc. that have been left outside before putting them on. Don't put your fingers under rocks or into tree holes, where spiders might be. Some spiders are commonly found inside buildings and homes, including the large and hairy Huntsman spiders, that are generally harmless, and reduce insect pests like cockroaches. The large spider webs strung between trees occupied by garden or orb weaving spiders are more an annoyance than a danger.\\n\\nHowever, some spiders are also very dangerous. The world's most venomous spider is the '''Sydney Funnel-Web spider''', found in and around Sydney and eastern New South Wales - usually under rocks and leaf litter. The spider is anywhere up to 5&nbsp;cm large, and is usually black. If you are in an area that is known for having Funnel-Web spiders and you are bitten by a spider that you believe could be a Funnel-Web it is important you get to hospital as quickly as possible. The Funnel-Web spends most of its time underground (it can typically live for only 30 minutes outside a humid hole) and therefore you are very unlikely to encounter one walking around. The last confirmed fatality was in 1979.\\n\\nThe '''Red Back spider''' (usually easily identified by a red mark on its abdomen) is common and after a bite it is important to seek medical attention, although it is not as urgent as with a Funnel-Web. Red Backs typically hide in dark places and corners. It is highly unusual to see them indoors; however, they can hide in sheds, around outdoor tables and chairs and under rocks or other objects sitting on the ground.\\n\\nFirst aid treatment for spider bites may vary in Australia compared to other areas of the world. Always seek medical advice after a bite has occurred. If possible, you should attempt to identify the creature that bit you. Take a photo or trap it so that the appropriate anti-venom can be administered swiftly. But don't risk getting bitten again.\\n\\n====Jellyfish====\\nTravellers in northern [[Queensland]], the [[Northern Territory]], or northern [[Western Australia]] should be aware of the risk of fatal stings from the '''Box Jellyfish''' if swimming in the ocean between October and May. They are very hard to detect and can be found in very shallow water. Stings from these jellyfish are 'excruciating' and often fatal. Vinegar applied immediately to adhering tentacles will lessen the amount of venom injected, but immediate medical assistance will be required. The danger season varies by location. In general the jellyfish are found close to shore, as they reproduce in the estuaries. They are not generally found out on the Great Barrier Reef, and many people swim on the reef without taking any precautions. Seek out reliable local information. Some locals at the beach can be cavalier to the risks.\\n\\n'''Irukandji''' are another species of tiny (fingernail sized) jellyfish that inhabit the waters off Northern Australia and the surrounding Indo-Pacific islands. They are also very hard to see, and can be dangerous, although stings are rare. Unlike the box jellyfish they are found out on the reef. The initial sting can go unnoticed. There is debate as to whether they can be fatal, but they certainly can place a victim in hospital, and cause extreme pain lasting days. If you have nausea or shooting pains shortly after emerging from the water seek medical treatment.\\n\\nA \\\"stinger-suit\\\" that is resistant to jellyfish stings costs around $100 or can be hired for around $20 a week.\\n\\n====Blue ring octopus====\\nFound in rock pools around the coasts of Australia is the tiny Blue Ring Octopus. Usually a dull sandy-beige colour, the creature has bright blue circles on its skin if threatened. The Blue Ring Octopus is rare and shy. Avoid placing your hand under rocks or in crevaces in rock pools or near the shore as this is where they tend to hide. Most locals do the same. It has a powerful paralysing toxin which can cause death unless artificial respiration is provided. In the history of Australia there are only two confirmed deaths by Blue Ring Octopus.\\n\\n====Crocodiles====\\n[[File:Crocodylus porosus - Daintree River.jpg|thumb|Saltwater crocodile]]\\nTravellers in northern Queensland, the Northern Territory or north Western Australia should be aware of the risk of fatal attacks by '''saltwater crocodiles''' in and adjacent to northern waters (ocean, estuarine and fresh water locations) between King Sound, Western Australia, and Rockhampton, Queensland. Saltwater crocodiles in these areas can reach 25 feet in length and can attack in water without warning. Despite what their name implies, they can be found in both salt and fresh water. On land, crocodiles usually lie motionless, but they have the ability to move with extraordinary speed in short bursts. There are relatively few attacks causing injury \\u2013 most attacks are fatal. Dangerous swimming areas will usually have prominent warning signs. In these regions only swim in inland waters if you are specifically advised that they are safe. Since 1970 there has been about one crocodile attack on a human each year.\\n\\nThe smaller '''freshwater crocodile''' is, unlike the saltwater, timid and will avoid humans if possible. The freshwater may attack to defend itself or its eggs or if startled. They can inflict a nasty bite but due to their small jaws and teeth this will rarely cause death in humans.\\n\\n====Dangerous flora====\\n'''The Gympie bush''' (''Dendrocnide moroides''), also known as the stinging tree, is a stinging plant, whose microscopic stinging hairs on leaves and branches can cause severe pain for up to several weeks. They are mostly found in northeast Queensland, especially in rain forest clearings. However, the Gympie bush and other closely related species (there are about five) of stinging tree can be found in southeast Queensland, and further south in eastern Australia. People bushwalking in such areas are advised not to touch the plant for any reason.\\n\\n===Crime and policing===\\n[[Crime]] rates in Australia are roughly comparable with other Western countries: few travellers will be victims of crime. You should take normal precautions against bag snatching, pickpocketing and the like. Some cities and towns have areas that can be dangerous at night, but these are generally off the tourist trail and highly unlikely for you to wander into by accident.\\n\\nAustralian police are generally approachable and trustworthy, and you should report assaults, theft or other crime to the police as soon as possible.\\n\\nThere are two types of police in Australia: the state/territorial police and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Typically you will only interact with the state police, as the AFP is largely dedicated to very specific government-related roles, the exception being the Australian Capital Territory where the AFP is the main police force, operating under the name of ACT Policing.\\n\\nUnder no circumstances should you offer an Australian police officer (or for that matter, any other government official such as a customs officer) a bribe or gratuity, as this is a crime and they will enforce the laws against it.\\n\\nWhen leaving your car alone, make sure it is locked, that the windows are rolled up, and that there are no obvious targets for theft in the vehicle, as thieves will often smash windows to get at a phone, GPS or bag that is visible in the car.\\n\\n====Scams====\\nAttempts to [[Common scams|scam]] tourists are not prevalent in Australia; take normal precautions such as finding out a little bit about your destination. There have been rare instances of criminals tampering with ATMs so that cash is trapped inside them, or so that they record card details for thieves. You should check your transaction records for odd transactions after using an ATMs and immediately contact the bank controlling the ATM if a transaction seems to be successful but the machine doesn't give you any cash. Always cover the keypad with your hand when entering your PIN to prevent any skimming devices which have cameras recording your PIN.\\n\\nATM Skimming is rare and easily avoided by using ATMs from trusted banks (ANZ, Commonwealth, Westpac, Nab), or ATMs located inside a bank \\\"gallery\\\" which are generally open 24/7 but are more secure than an outdoor ATM.\\n\\nAdditionally, the ATO will never try to ask you to pay off your debts with Spotify or iTunes gift cards, and these ongoing scams have been targeting especially the elderly and those who are unaware of them. If you go to a Coles, Woolies, Myer, Target, Big W, Kmart etc. there will be warning notices at all checkouts, and it can never hurt to read them.\\n\\n===Racism===\\nAustralia is outwardly a multicultural and racially tolerant society and there are strong laws that prohibit hate speech and other forms of discrimination on grounds of race. Nevertheless, racism is still a sensitive subject for a nation still not fully reconciled to its history of colonial occupation. Forced appropriation of Aboriginal lands along with formal discrimination, state-sanctioned racism and even forced separation of Aboriginal children (known as the Stolen Generations) from their families extended well into the 20th century. Gradual change throughout the last century saw the abandonment of the white-only immigration policy, citizenship for the Aboriginal people, and the establishment of large communities of Asian, Middle Eastern and African origin. However, to this day, Aboriginal people are still discriminated against, and while on paper they have equal rights, they are often charged for things that a white person would usually not.\\n[[File:Car with personalised plate celebrating being a Wog.jpg|thumb|Still not an invitation to call the driver a \\\"wog\\\"]]\\nVisitors to Australia are fortunately unlikely to encounter random incidents of racial abuse. If it does happen then you can report it to the police and expect action to be taken. Violent incidents are even rarer.\\n\\nWords referring to racial background can be used between friends of different ethnic groups, but it is '''strongly advised not to try them out yourself'''. You may well hear Pom (British), Yank (American), Paki (Indian sub-continent), Wog (Southern European or Middle Eastern) and Curry Muncher (South Indian) being used. In particular British people would regard some of these terms as particularly racist, but they are used far more casually in Australia. '''''Never''''' refer to Aboriginal people as \\\"Abos\\\", \\\"native tribes\\\", \\\"Aborigines\\\", \\\"Noogas\\\" or \\\"ATSI\\\" as they are regarded as highly racist terms.\\n\\nThere are anti-immigration and anti-multicultural groups that operate in Australian society, for the most part agitating against the immigration of people from Muslim and African countries. As a visitor you would be unlikely to come into contact with them, although if it's late at night in a pub, and you start prodding people for their racial views, then all bets are off \\u2014 be prepared for anything. The western suburbs of Melbourne has experienced some violent crime involving youths of African descent, which in turn has been greatly exaggerated by much of the local media and some politicians, fuelling racist sentiments.\\n\\nIt is not offensive to use ''Aussie'' (Ozzie) to describe Australian people, but it isn't a term Australians generally use to self-identify. They are more likely to apply it to things (Aussie Rules, etc.) than to themselves. When the chant of Aussie, Aussie, Aussie \\u2014 Oi Oi Oi goes up at an international sporting event, some Australians will cringe, and others will join in. Often this depends on their own perceived social standing, or their state of inebriation, or both.\\n\\nAnd while Australia may seem multicultural in major cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Gold Coast, Newcastle, Hobart or Canberra; rural areas are usually less so and stick to their Anglo-Celtic roots. People who do not look Aussie on the outside are often subject to racism, though this is usually targeted at immigrants (often those of Vietnamese, Middle Eastern or African descent) rather than tourists.\\n\\n===Tobacco===\\nAustralia is likely the '''world's most expensive country for smokers''': a single cigarette pack costs upwards of $50. Vapes, where available, cost around $35. Black market loose tobacco, known as \\\"chop-chop\\\", or illegally imported Chinese cigarettes are widely available under the counter at tobacconists.\\n\\n===Illegal drugs===\\nOpium, heroin, amphetamines (speed), cocaine (\\\"coke\\\"), LSD and ecstasy (\\\"molly\\\") are all illegal to possess and to sell in all jurisdictions of Australia. Trafficking offences carry a long jail term, and in serious cases can even lead to life imprisonment. Australia shares information on drug trafficking with other countries, even those with the death penalty.\\n\\nMedical use of cannabis (\\\"marijuana\\\"/\\\"weed\\\"/\\\"pot\\\"/\\\"gunja\\\") is legal on a federal level, although obtaining a prescription is generally a time-consuming ordeal not feasible for a visitor. As of 2024, the Australian Capital Territory (Canberra) remains the first and only jurisdiction to legalise personal use, but commercial sale is not allowed. In South Australia and Northern Territory, possession of personal use quantities is decriminalised, although on-the-spot fines still apply. In all other states possession remains a criminal offense, and foreigners should not expect more lenient treatment than locals from Australian police for drug offences. Driving while under the influence of drugs is a serious offence, and doing so will invariably lead to arrest and prosecution, and in serious cases even a jail sentence.\\n\\n'''Do not under any circumstances attempt to bring illicit drugs into Australia''', including marijuana; this is strictly illegal and punishable with long jail terms of up to life in prison, and customs officers often employ dogs to sniff drugs out of arriving passengers' luggage. Dogs can even tell that you smoked marijuana from the day before you flew to Australia, so you may be held back for some long questioning.\\n\\nAustralia's proximity to [[Asia]] means that heroin is a far more commonly used illicit drug than cocaine or crack cocaine. In some areas of large cities you will need to be careful of discarded needles: however these will generally be found in back streets rather than in popular tourist spots.\\n\\n===Firearms===\\nFirearm ownership is rare in Australia, with strict licensing requirements resulting in gun ownership being typically limited to hunters and farmers in rural areas, as well as sport shooters. Possession of any kind of firearm requires a licence, and semi-automatic assault rifles are prohibited for civilians. It is possible, albeit tedious, to import single-shot rifles, shotguns and pistols for target shooting with the correct paperwork. Criminal gangs sometimes carry illegal firearms in urban areas, although it is unlikely that travellers will run into them.\\n\\nIt is very difficult to bring firearms into Australia, with a police permit required for each state to be visited ''before'' arrival.\\n\\n===LGBT travellers===\\n{{see also|LGBT travel}}\\n\\nAustralia has an equal age of consent set at 16 for all states except Tasmania and South Australia where the age is 17. Same sex marriage is legal in Australia, having been passed into law in 2017 after a majority (61%) voted in favour of it in a national postal survey.\\n\\nAttitudes to homosexuality are similar to those found in other Western countries. Although inner Sydney is one of the most gay-friendly cities in the world, caution is still advisable in conservative rural areas, including rural parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. Australia has outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and legal recourse may be available should you experience discrimination. Police assistance for discrimination may be difficult to obtain in remote and rural areas, although homosexuality is accepted in most rural areas. Transgender people are, likewise, widely accepted.\\n\\nSydney is Australia's gay capital and hosts one of the world's most famous gay pride festivals \\u2013 the [http://www.mardigras.org.au Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras] \\u2013 annually during February and March. The festival culminates in a huge parade through central Sydney which attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators. [[Alice Springs]] celebrates the \\\"Alice Is Wonderland Festival\\\", a gay and lesbian pride festival in late April/early May. [[Melbourne]] has the [https://www.midsumma.org.au Midsumma festival] every year on the first Sunday of February.\\n\\n==Stay healthy==\\n\\n===Skin===\\n[[File:Sunbaker maxdupain nga76.54.jpg|thumbnail|\\\"Sunbaker\\\" from 1937 is one of the most widely recognised of all Australian photographs.]]\\nExposure to the sun at Australian latitudes frequently results in '''[[sunburn]]''', and Australians have the highest skin cancer rate in the world. Getting sunburnt can make you feel feverish and unwell and may take a few days or weeks to heal depending on the severity. It means you can't go back out into the sun until the sunburn fades, so getting sunburnt on the first day of your beach holiday can seriously reduce the fun of your trip. It can take as little as 15 minutes to burn in Australia on a fine summer's day, even in shaded outdoor areas. You should wear sunscreen (SPF 50+), clothing, and a hat to shade the sun.\\n\\nRe-apply sunscreen every 2\\u20133 hours throughout the day as it wears off quickly if you are sweating or swimming. Make sure to cover all parts of your body. UV radiation in the middle of the day can be double what it is in the early morning or later afternoon, so if possible avoid the sun during the hottest part of the day. [http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/uv/index.shtml Daily UV forecasts] are issued by the Bureau of Meteorology online.\\n\\n'''Spray-on sunscreen''' from an aerosol bottle is popular because of its ease of use; however, it is far less effective than traditional sunscreen.\\n\\nIf you are heading to the beach, consider buying a sun-tent (less than $20 from discount and hardware stores). You generally can't hire beach umbrellas at Australian beaches, and they are very exposed.\\n\\n===Food preparation===\\nAustralia has high hygiene standards, with restaurants required to observe strict food preparation standards. [[Food poisoning]] rates are comparable to other first world nations.\\n\\n===Water===\\nThe '''[[tap water]]''' in urban Australia is always safe to drink. Occasionally you may encounter recycled water taps which are for watering plants and not drinking; these should be coloured purple. Public drinking fountains and bottle refill stations are common in cities and at tourist attractions. The taste and hardness of the tap water will vary considerably across the country. Some cities such as Adelaide rely on ground water supplies that have an unpleasant taste, but are perfectly safe. Many households use water purifier jugs. Bottled water is also widely available. Carrying water on hot days is a good idea in urban areas, and it is a necessity if hiking or driving out of town. Remoter areas in the outback may not have treated drinking water on tap. At sites where tap water is untreated, water sterilization tablets may be used as an alternative to boiling. If driving long distances on infrequently trafficked roads it is essential to carry drinking water. This is absolutely necessary in hotter areas and on dirt roads or tracks. It is rare that someone does not die of thirst in outback Australia in any year. It is recommended that in event of a breakdown you stay with the car for shade and to increase your chances of being found. Before long-distance touring seek specific advice on calculating how much water to carry for the proposed journey and allowing for breakdowns.\\n\\n===Vaccinations===\\nAustralia does not have endemic communicable diseases that will require non-standard vaccinations. Like many other countries, it will require evidence of [[yellow fever]] vaccinations on entry if you will have been in a country with a risk of infection within 6 days before your arrival in Australia.\\n\\n===Mosquitoes===\\nMosquitoes are present all year round in the tropics, and during the summer in southern areas. Screens on windows and doors are common, and repellent is readily available. Ross River Virus is spread by mosquitoes in the tropics, and can make you sick for a few weeks. There have been cases of [[dengue fever]], for which no specific treatment exists. Malaria is not present in mainland Australia.\\n\\n===Medical care===\\n[[File:VH-FDE (16640399301).jpg|thumb|Royal Flying Doctor Service aircraft]]\\nAs described above, '''000''' is the Australian emergency services number and in any medical emergency you should call this number and ask for an ambulance and other emergency services as necessary, to attend.\\n\\nAustralia has first world medical standards. In particular, it is safe to receive blood transfusions in Australia, as donors are screened for HIV, hepatitis and many other blood borne illnesses.\\n\\nAustralia's population density is low; parts of Australia are a long way from medical facilities of any kind. Many of these areas are served by the '''[[Royal Flying Doctor Service]]'''. Small towns with populations of 5,000 or more will have a small hospital capable of giving emergency treatment. Larger towns will have a base hospital capable of routine and some kinds of emergency surgery. In some cases you may need to be evacuated to one of the capital cities for specialist treatment.\\n\\nCapital cities will have medical centres where you can drop in, often open on weekends or until late. In country towns you may have to make an appointment and may have no alternative other than the closest hospital after hours and weekends. You can also expect to wait a few hours if your condition isn't urgent.\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Poisons Information Hotline\\n| phone=13 11 26 (in country only)\\n| content=Give free advice if any medication or poisons are taken inadvertently. They will also give advice on what treatment is necessary for things like a spider bite. However, if you think you are in any immediate danger, call '000' for an ambulance.\\n}}\\n\\n==== Medical costs and travel insurance ====\\n\\nAustralian citizens and permanent residents mostly use the taxpayer-funded '''Medicare''' system. Foreigners working or studying in Australia and without a reciprocal agreement are generally required to take up private health insurance as part of their visa conditions. Foreigners on a short visit will want to make sure their travel insurance is in order, as medical costs can be expensive for those not entitled to Medicare benefits. '''Medicare does not cover ambulances, private hospitals or dental care''', so you will need to obtain private health insurance to pay for these.\\n\\nTravellers from [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Slovenia]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]] are entitled to '''free reciprocal Medicare treatment''' for emergency care at a hospital, and sometimes for other health problems that occur during their visit. It is advisable to familiarise yourself with the conditions of the [http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/enablers/medicare/reciprocal-health-care-agreements/health-care-for-visitors-to-australia reciprocal arrangement with your country]. For example, Irish and New Zealand citizens are only entitled to free treatment at a hospital, whereas the other reciprocal nationalities are entitled to subsidised treatment at general practitioners as well. Reciprocal programs never cover private hospitals, so the full cost of these services will have to be met by yourself or with [[travel insurance]].\\n\\nIf you are not a citizen or permanent resident of a reciprocal agreement country then travel insurance is highly recommended.\\nYou can expect to pay around $80 to see a general practitioner, plus additional costs for any pathology or medical imaging required. The charge to visit a local hospital can be much more expensive, private hospitals even more so. You can pay up to $500 even if you are not admitted, and upwards of $1000 if you are. Rescue and Royal Flying Doctor Services are free and taxpayer-funded, but evacuation or ambulance services can cost many thousands of dollars from a country town to a capital city, or from an island to the mainland.\\n\\nEven if you are an Australian citizen, ambulance and evacuation services are not provided free of charge. If an air-ambulance is required this can still cost thousands of dollars. Most health-insurance companies sell ambulance only cover valid Australia-wide. Ambulance membership programs may only cover you in your own state - check before travelling interstate. Domestic travel insurance does not usually cover medical or ambulance expenses. Medicare cover does not include ambulance costs (starting at $1000) in the event of an emergency; only private insurance ''with ambulance cover'' will pay for this.\\n\\nSnake and spider bite anti-venom is very expensive. The cost can be well over $10,000 even if you don't need a stay in hospital.\\n\\n==Connect==\\n\\n===Telephone===\\n====Calling overseas from Australia====\\nThe main international access code or prefix is '''0011''' (when using a mobile phone the plus symbol \\\"+\\\" can be used instead of the 0011 prefix).\\n\\n====Dialling codes====\\nThe country code for international calls to Australia is +61. When dialling from overseas, omit any leading '0' in the area code. The area code is optional when calling from the same area code area.\\n\\n[[Norfolk Island]] and Australian-Antarctic bases use the +672 code, not Australia's country code. See the specific articles.\\n\\nAustralian area code list:\\n* 02 = Central East (New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and north-eastern fringe of Victoria)\\n* 03 = South East (Southern NSW, Victoria and Tasmania)\\n* 04 = Mobile phones Australia-wide (higher call charges apply)\\n* 07 = North East (Queensland and parts of Northern NSW)\\n* 08 = Central & West (Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western New South Wales)\\n\\nLocal calls are free of charge.\\n\\n* If calling an Australian number from outside Australia, use the format +61 880803300 (no \\\"0\\\" area code prefix; substitute the relevant international dialling prefix for the \\\"+\\\" if needed).\\n* If making an international call from within Australia dial the ''international dialling prefix'' or \\\"+\\\", followed by the ''country code'', followed by destination ''area code'', followed by the ''local number'' at the destination. For most countries you need to omit the area code prefix (usually \\\"0\\\" as in Australia).\\n\\nFor example, the local number for the [[Moree (New South Wales)|Moree]] tourist information is {{nowrap|6757-3350}}. The area code is 02 as Moree is in the Central East area code region. To dial the number from [[Sydney]] or anywhere else ''inside'' the same area code, just dial {{nowrap|6757-3350}}. To dial the number from [[Brisbane]] or anywhere in Australia ''outside'' the area code region, you will need to dial {{nowrap|02 6757-3350}}. If you don't know your area code region, you can include the area code, and it will work regardless of from where you are calling. To dial the number from overseas you will need to dial {{nowrap|+61 2 6757-3350}}.\\n\\n====Special numbers====\\n* Numbers commencing with '''13''' are charged at a local call rate, and what they connect you to can vary according to your location. They can be 10 or 6 digit numbers. For example, 1300 796 222, will connect you with the [[Albury]] tourist information, no matter where you are in Australia. However, 131 008 will connect you with a different local taxi service depending on where you are. 13 22 32 will connect you to New South Wales Railways in Sydney or Victorian Railways in Melbourne. Calling these numbers internationally can be problematic.\\n* Numbers commencing with '''18''' are free when dialled from a payphone or fixed phone, and commonly used for hotel reservation numbers, or tourist information numbers.\\n* Numbers commencing with '''19''' are premium numbers, often with ''very'' hefty call charges (make sure you check before dialling).\\n* Numbers commencing with '''12''' are carrier services, and are dependent on what network you are connected to. For example, '''12 456''' is a general information number for Telstra. Vodafone offer a similar services on '''123'''. These numbers can be premium services as well.\\n\\nCalling special numbers internationally can often work - just try dialling the number prefixed with the +61 country code. Many locations will give an alternative direct number for use in international dialling.\\n\\nMaking reverse charge (collect) calls is very expensive and can be problematic. You can use 12550 from a Telstra public phone, or 1800 NO CASH from any phone. But you have to be calling a number that will accept the charges (usually a landline or mobile on a mainstream telco).\\n\\n====Mobile phones====\\n{{anchor|Mobile Cellular Phones}}\\nAustralia has three mobile networks operated by [http://www.telstra.com.au Telstra], [http://www.optus.com.au Optus] and [http://www.vodafone.com.au Vodafone], with numerous resellers for each.  All three operate LTE (4G) and 5G networks; 3G is being phased out and will stop working by the end of 2024.  Generally speaking, Telstra provides the best coverage, but is the most expensive, while Vodafone often does not have coverage in rural towns, but is the cheapest.  Unpopulated or sparsely populated areas away from major roads are unlikely to have service at all. If you are heading way out into the bush then a '''satellite phone''' may be your only option. Remember all mobile phones can be used for emergency calls on all networks, even if they don't have a local SIM or aren't roaming. This applies to satellite phones too.\\n\\nWith foreign SIM cards, international roaming is generally seamless onto Australia's 4G networks, depending on agreements between operators. 5G networks are different with frequencies and can vary with the compatibility of your phone. Check with your home operator before you leave.  There are no restrictions on overseas residents obtaining Australian prepaid SIM cards, although you may require some form of photo ID such as your passport for identification.\\n\\nA cheap prepaid mobile phone with a SIM retails for around $40 in most Australian retail outlets, supermarkets, and post offices; a SIM alone for an existing phone is around $2\\u20133. Prepaid credit is added using recharge cards available at all supermarkets, newsagents, some ATMs, and other outlets.\\n\\nYou can buy a seemly infinite variety of packages, SIM cards, and phone bundles, with varied combinations of data, SMS and call time. Some carriers make calculating included calls difficult, by giving you a dollar \\\"value\\\" that is included in your package, and you then need to find the call, sms and data rates to calculate what is included. These rates can differ from plan to plan. Make sure the plan you choose includes what you need, because using data or making calls outside of the package allowance is often orders of magnitude more expensive.\\n\\nThe 3G shutdown will impact whether you're able to use your current phone to Australia: it needs to support Voice over LTE, the manufacturer needs to have loaded configuration files for at least one Australian network operator, the phone needs to also support emergency calls over LTO, and the service provider needs to recognise it as a compatible device. Whether or not the model is sold in Australia does not guarantee compatibility, as there can be minor differences based on the region it was exported to. As of October 2024, it is unclear how this will affect roaming (i.e. bringing a SIM from your home country -- whether the device still needs to be fully compatible). You may be able to purchase a data-only plan, which would allow you to receive SMS (but not send) and access the internet, without the ability to make or receive phone calls, but that has not yet been confirmed. You may have to buy a phone when you arrive. Wifi is not affected, and you may be able to just use free wifi if you're in towns.\\n\\n===Satellite phones===\\n[[File:Telstra phonebox at Quinns.jpg|thumb|A typical Telstra payphone]]\\nIf you need comprehensive coverage in rural and remote areas, you can use a satellite phone. Iridium, Globalstar and Thuraya satellite services are available in Australia. Expect to pay around $120 per week to hire a satellite phone, plus call costs. Satellite messaging units, which send your location and a help SMS or email, can be hired for around $80 per week.\\n\\nThese units are only available from specialist dealers, often only in major cities (away from the remote areas you may be visiting). You should be able to acquire or hire these units in your home country before departure if you wish.\\n\\nSatellite phones can be used to make emergency calls without a SIM card or subscription plan. The cheapest cost around $300, or just a little more than a PLB.\\n\\n=== Public phones ===\\nMost towns and suburbs have at least one public phone. Most railway stations will have a public phone. All public phones in Australia are '''free''' for local calls to landlines and mobiles. International calls may be made using Telstra or third-party calling cards available from newsagents. Free text messages can be sent from any Telstra public phone, using the keypad in much the same way as an old-style mobile phone. Follow the instructions on the phone display.\\n\\n===Wifi===\\nVirtually all accommodations in Australia from youth hostel and caravan park to 5-star hotel have '''free wifi''', as do most cafes, shopping malls and even some forms of public transport like trains and ferries.  If you need to borrow a full-fledged PC to go online, public libraries are usually your best bet.  Internet cafes are virtually obsolete, although you can still find gaming cafes here and there.\\n\\nIn major urban centres, you'll find free Wi-Fi in shopping malls and other large shops and increasingly on public transport: Sydney's ferries offer free Wi-Fi as do Adelaide's trams.\\n\\n=== Radio and television ===\\n\\nAustralia has 2 national public broadcasters, the [http://www.abc.net.au/ ABC] and [https://www.sbs.com.au/ SBS]. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (or ABC) broadcasts Local Radio, Triple J (Youth/Indie music) and ABC Classic on AM/FM Radio as well as 5 TV channels. The Special Broadcasting Service (or SBS) broadcasts more ethnic, bilingual and cultural content on 6 TV channels and 2 analog radio stations. Both broadcasters are available in most populous areas but the ABC has a greater radio coverage.  DAB+ Digital Radio is available in capital cities.\\n\\nThere are 3 free-to-air commercial TV networks, namely [https://au.tv.yahoo.com/ Seven], [https://www.nine.com.au/ Nine] and [https://tenplay.com.au/ Ten]. You should expect to be able to receive and watch all these channels in almost all accommodation in towns and cities across Australia.  The cable TV monopoly used to be Foxtel, still advertised by many hotels, but these days Netflix and its local competitors [https://stan.com.au Stan] and [https://kayosports.com.au/ Kayo Sports] rule the roost.\\n\\nThe bigger the city, the more radio stations you'll find. Country towns will often just have one commercial radio station and the [https://www.abc.net.au/local/ ABC]. If you're driving the distances between country towns, you can often lose all radio coverage. Download some music or podcasts for the trip before you leave. It's advisable to stay tuned to the ABC if travelling during emergencies or high bushfire risk periods.\\n\\n===News===\\nThe main national broadsheet newspaper is [https://www.theaustralian.com.au/ The Australian], with [http://www.afr.com/ The Australian Financial Review] focussing on financial and business news. There are also other newspapers that are published locally within their respective states, the most notable ones being ''[http://www.smh.com.au/ The Sydney Morning Herald]'' and ''[https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/ The Daily Telegraph]'', both based in Sydney, and ''[https://www.theage.com.au/ The Age]'' and ''[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ Herald Sun]'', both based in Melbourne.\\n\\n===Post===\\n[[File:Australia Post boxes.jpg|thumb|Express (yellow) and normal (red) Australia Post street posting boxes]]\\n'''[http://www.auspost.com.au Australia Post]''' runs Australia's postal service. Letters can be posted in any red Australia Post posting box, which are found at all post offices and many other locations. All stamps can be purchased from post offices, and some stamps can be purchased from newsagents and hotels. Posting a standard letter or postcard costs $1.70 within Australia (up to 250g), and between $3.00 and $3.70 internationally (up to 20g). Sending international letters up to 50g is cheaper in November and December, at $2.40, but the letter must have \\\"card only\\\" written on the front. 'Domestic' and 'international' stamps are different, as international is tax free, therefore, so make sure you use the right stamp. Parcels, express post and other services are also available.\\n\\nAddresses in Australia are generally formatted in the following way, which is similar to addresses in the United States and Canada:\\n\\n<blockquote>Name of recipient<br/>(If needed) Unit number or building name<br/>House number and street name<br/>City or town, two or three-letter state abbreviation, postcode</blockquote>\\n\\nYou can receive mail via ''Poste Restante'' in any city or town. Mail should be addressed to your full name c/o Post Restante.

Australians mostly view their slang as being uniquely Australian and an integral part of their culture. Judging by the number of Australian slang books available on the shelves, it remains of interest to travellers too.\\n\\nMany parts of Australian slang have their origins outside Australia, particularly in England and Ireland.  Don't be surprised if many terms seem familiar. However, don't assume that similar slang expressions have the same meaning to Australians as they might in other countries. An attempt to use some Australian slang will likely be viewed as an attempt to mock, rather than as a genuine attempt to speak the local dialect. It's better to use the guide to interpret Steve Irwin's former TV shows or if you're really unsure, just use American English, as nearly every Australian speaks American English just as well as they speak their own dialect. Trying to use British English also will get you there in most places, but most British terms that are not commonly used in Australia (such as ''lorry'' or ''crisps'') will likely not be understood by most, unlike American.\\n\\nA significant portion of Australian lexicon and place names derive from one of the hundreds of [[Indigenous Australian culture|Indigenous Australian]] languages spoken before the British colonial period, many of which are still spoken today. Some words and names like \\\"Wooloomooloo\\\", \\\"Oodnadatta\\\" or \\\"Kununurra\\\" which visitors to the country may find challenging to pronounce, typically roll off the tongue of Australian English speakers. \\n\\nEnglish-speaking travellers are best advised just to speak clearly, as most Australians are used to a variety of accents.  However, it can never hurt to say \\\"G'day, How ya goin'\\\" to an Aussie.

While few of the sites of the fighting between European settlers and Indigenous Australians have been marked, much less preserved, there are still a number of former fortifications and airfields.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Chateau Wood Ypres 1917.jpg|thumb|300px|Australian soldiers on the Western Front in France during World War I. This was Australia's most costly war, with over 60,000 men being killed]]\\nThe only large scale war to have taken place in Australia was the fighting between Indigenous Australians and European settlers which began shortly after white settlement in 1788 and continued until the early 1930s. While over 20,000 Indigenous Australians and between 2,000 and 2,500 settlers are estimated to have been killed, there are very few monuments or memorials to the frontier wars, and no battle sites have been preserved. A team of academics is developing an [https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/ online map] of locations where battles and massacres occurred which may be helpful for visiting these sites.\\n\\nDuring the colonial era (1788-1901) barracks and coastal fortifications were established around the colonial capital cities. Britain stationed forces in Australia until the country achieved full self-governance in 1901, though it ceased deploying land forces to the continent in 1870. However, the Australian military continued to be deployed around the world as part of the British forces in its various wars, and any declaration of war by Britain was also taken to imply that Australia was also at war.\\n\\nThere was virtually no fighting in and little near Australia during [[World War I]], but camps were established to train the men of the Australian Imperial Force before they were deployed overseas. Approximately 60,000 Australian soldiers were killed in the war, and small - and often very moving - memorials were established commemorating them in most towns and suburbs as well as in some churches, schools and workplaces. Larger memorials were also established in the centre of the state capital cities. These memorials have often been used to commemorate casualties of subsequent wars.\\n\\n===World War II===\\n{{Seealso|Pacific War}}\\nAustralia's defences were improved in the lead up to World War II, with new coastal defences and strategic airstrips being established. Following the rapid Japanese victories in 1941 and 1942 the Australian Government and many Australians feared that the country faced invasion (though the Japanese had no such plans), and these defences were further improved. As the war turned in the favour of the Allies a network of airfields and major Army bases was established in Queensland and the Northern Territory to support the Allied counter-offensive in the Pacific. Many of these airfields were later developed into Australia's post-war network of airports, while others were abandoned; in some circumstances their remains can be visited, though are unlikely to be of much interest.\\n\\n===Post-war history===\\nIn the years after World War II most of the airfields and virtually all of the coastal fortifications were abandoned by the military. The focus of the Australian military shifted more strongly to expeditionary warfare during the Cold War period, with the country being involved in the [[Korean War]], Malaysian Emergency and [[Vietnam War]]. The Vietnam War was the largest of these conflicts, and is commemorated through a number of museums and memorials. The other conflicts have attracted far less attention.\\n\\nSince 1947, Australian forces have served around the world as part of peacekeeping missions. The Australian Defence Force has also seen combat in the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria since 2001. The modern Australian Defence Force operates from bases which are generally in or near major cities. Few of these facilities are open to the public, but some have small museums on their outskirts which can be visited.\\n\\nThe Australian War Memorial, in [[Canberra]], is Australia's main military history museum, and also serves as a memorial to the men and women killed during wars and peacekeeping deployments. The Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force maintain a central museum, as well as a network of smaller museums. The Army does not have a central museum, but operates a [https://www.army.gov.au/our-heritage/museums network of specialised museums]{{Dead link|date=November 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} spread across Australia. There are also a large number of government and independently-run military history museums. Most towns and the older suburbs of the large cities have a small war memorial which lists the names of the locals killed in war: these serve as the focal points of the '''ANZAC Day''' dawn services on April 25 each year; these are listed on the [http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/conflict Monument Australia] website. Some of the former coastal fortifications and barracks have been opened to the public.\\n\\n===ANZAC day===\\n25 April 1915 marked the beginning of the Battle of Gallipoli, as the Allied forces attacked Gallipoli, western Turkey, in an attempt to attack Constantinople and gain control over the Dardanelles. One of the units on the Allied side was the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) comprising about 65,000 men. This was the first significant campaign to involve large Australian and New Zealand forces.\\n\\nEver since, the Anzac Day has been commemorated on 25 April in Australia and New Zealand a national holiday with dawn services (the landing at Gallipoli took place at dawn) at military memorials and parades. Commemorations are also held in many locations around the world with significant populations of Australians and New Zealanders. The gambling game two-up, popular among Australian soldiers during World War I, is legal at pubs around Australia only on Anzac Day. Anzac biscuits, popular with soldiers on the battlefield as well as in Australia at that time are eaten, and some opt for a \\\"gunfire breakfast\\\"; black coffee with added rum.\\n\\n==Prepare==\\nA huge number of books have been written on Australia's military history. Jeffrey Grey's ''A Military History of Australia'' is a well-regarded overview, and ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'' is invaluable. Chris Coulthard-Clark's book ''The Encyclopedia of Australia's Battles'' provides useful summaries of the main battles Australian forces have been involved in, and includes the main engagements which were fought during the frontier wars. ''Sacred Places : War Memorials in the Australian Landscape'' by Ken Inglis discusses the establishment of these monuments and how attitudes to them have changed over time.\\n\\nThere are also many books and websites on individual historic sites within Australia. Local histories often discuss the region's experiences during the world wars, and many of the towns in northern Australia have been the subject of books on their experience of the [[Pacific War|Second World War]]. While many of these works are self-published by amateur historians, the general quality is good. Virtually all military museums maintain a website.\\n\\n==Go==\\n{{mapframe}}\\n===Australian Capital Territory===\\n[[File:Australian War Memorial.jpg|thumb|300px|The courtyard of the Australian War Memorial]]\\n;Museums\\n* {{see\\n| name=Australian War Memorial | alt= | url=http://www.awm.gov.au/ | email=\\n| address=Treloar Crescent, Campbell [[Canberra|ACT]] | lat=-35.2805 | long=149.1491 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=Daily 10AM\\u20135PM, except for Christmas Day | price=Free\\n| wikipedia=Australian War Memorial | image=The_National_War_Memorial,_Canberra.JPG | wikidata=Q782783\\n| content=Generally considered one of Australia's best museums, the Australian War Memorial (AWM) provides an in-depth examination of the country's involvement in war and peacekeeping.

These can be seen from nearby roads, though the station is closed to the public.\\n}}\\n\\n==Respect==\\n\\nWhile Australians are generally relaxed about their history and many acknowledge its more unsavoury aspects, some people may react badly to criticism of the military or individual soldiers (especially suggestions that Australia did not pull its weight in a battle or war, or that soldiers displayed cowardice or committed atrocities). Strong criticism of the military on Anzac Day is widely regarded as being offensive. The Australian military is an apolitical institution, and it is generally considered inappropriate to make political demonstrations at military-focused events or involving war memorials. Additionally, saying the military is bad or even just talking about the military in public may be offensive to small minorities of people. Australian service people and veterans generally don't expect adulation, and some don't acknowledge having served in the military.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n[[File:PineGap-sign.jpg|thumb|300px|Access to some Australian Defence Force and intelligence facilities, such as the Pine Gap facility near Alice Springs, is highly restricted]]\\n\\nIt is illegal to take photographs of active Australian Defence Force bases and other \\\"prohibited\\\" areas. However, this does not seem to be enforced for facilities which are open to the public or can be viewed from public land (for instance, much of the Royal Australian Navy's main base in Sydney can be overlooked from parkland and ferries), or at open days. If signs are displayed prohibiting photography or guards advise you to not take photos, you must put the camera away. Even bringing a camera onto \\\"prohibited\\\" areas can lead to prosecution.\\n\\nDue to security requirements, visitors to most of the military museums on active Australian Defence Force bases are required to show photo ID to gain entry. You may also need to book a visit and be escorted to and from the museum. The websites of these museums explain the access requirements, and should be consulted before visiting.\\n\\n==Go next==\\nAustralians often visit the battlefields where Australian military forces fought overseas.\\n\\nThe main areas visited are [[Gallipoli]] in [[Turkey]] and the former Western Front in [[France]], and many people also visit the Australian battlefields in [[Vietnam]] and some locations where Australians were held prisoner in [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]]. Most of these areas can be easily visited by independent travellers, and specialised tours are also available. Trekking the [[Kokoda Track]] in Papua New Guinea is popular, but is not to be undertaken lightly. The other Australian battlefields in Asia are rarely visited, and many of the battlefields in North Africa and the Middle East are in countries which are suffering from political instability or civil war. The historian Peter Stanley's book ''A Stout Pair of Boots'' provides useful advice on visiting Australian battlefields overseas, and there are many specialised guides to the battlefields in France, Gallipoli and along the Kokoda Track.\\n\\n[[New Zealand]] has a similar range of military museums to those in Australia, and some sites relating to the Colonial-era New Zealand Wars have been preserved.\\n\\n\\n{{guidetopic}}\\n{{PartOfTopic|Military tourism|Australia}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Hartz National Park banner 6.jpg|caption=Hartz Lake and the Arthurs Range seen from the top of Hartz Peak, Hartz Mtns National Park}}\\n\\nThe '''[https://www.huonvalleytas.com/ Huon and Far South]''' (Huon Valley) is Australia's southernmost inhabited area in [[southern Tasmania]] with a population of 17,219 (2018).

This is because visiting Macquarie Island requires extensive permits; it is not visitable on an ordinary trip to the Huon and Far South.}}\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Newdegate cave-Tasmania-Australia13.JPG|thumb|300px|Newdegate Cave in Hastings Caves State Reserve]]\\nWith most of the region situated south of the 43\\u00b0S line, the Huon and Far South is closer to continental Antarctica than it is to Perth, Western Australia or Cairns, Queensland, and with no major landmass to block the cool Antarctic breeze, the Huon cops much of it, making it a prime location to grow fruits traditionally grown in colder climates such as apples, pears or cherries, which today is the Huon's largest industry.\\n\\nThe Huon and Far South can be divided into two geographically distinct regions: the west, which is almost entirely protected under [[Southwest National Park]] or [[Hartz Mountains National Park]], which are ''very'' mountainous, alpine, and have many glacial lakes, with few to no roads (meaning you have to visit many POIs on foot), making up for most of the region by area, and the smaller eastern section, where all settlements (excluding Melaleuca), farms, and infrastructure are.\\n\\n==Get in==\\nLike other parts of Tasmania, the Huon is a ''very'' car-centric region. The only likely case where you won't be entering by car is if you fly to Melaleuca and then hike the multi-day '''South Coast Track''' (see [[Southwest National Park]] for details).\\n\\nThe main highway into the Huon and Far south is the '''Huon Highway''' (A6), a highway that links [[Kingston (Tasmania)|Kingston]] to Southport via Huonville; the highway north of Kingston is the '''Southern Outlet''' from [[Hobart]]. Between Kingston and Huonville, the highway is a good 2+1 road but without a median strip. South of Huonville, the road is two lanes with few overtaking opportunities, without a shoulder in some areas.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nAs stated in [[#Get in|&sect; Get in]], you will almost always need a car to get around. Some places, however, like Lion Rock or Adamsons Falls, both of which are somewhat-popular POIs in the Huon Valley, are only accessible on foot.\\n\\n==See==\\n[[File:Lion Rock, a shooting star and Aurora Australis.jpg|thumb|300px|The aurora is a common sight in the Huon and Far South (Lion Rock, Southwest National Park)]]\\nWhile it depends on whether the sky wants to have it or decide to not, the '''[[Southern Lights]]''' is a common sight in this region of Tasmania, provided that you are not viewing the lights in a location affected by light polution (so not Huonville or even small towns like Franklin or Geeveston). [https://www.huonvalleyescapes.net/southern-lights-aurora.html This] page has an aurora predictor for the next upcoming three calendar days, but it's not 100 per cent accurate; [https://www.sws.bom.gov.au/Aurora BOM's SWS] may also be of some use.\\n\\nWhile this region isn't particularly for '''glacial lakes''' (the Highland Lakes region is, though), there are a few near-pristine lakes in [[Hartz Mountains National Park]], most of which have good walking trails; Lake Esperance has it a step further with a boardwalk.\\n\\nFor those interested in caves, '''[[Hastings Caves State Reserve]]''' contains the largest dolomite cave in Australia, which contains more flowstones, straws, and shawls than other Australian caves (good for photography). Close to the caves is a thermal hot spring, perfect for a cold Tasmanian summer morning.\\n\\nTo learn about the region's '''timber industry''', The Wooden Boat Centre in [[Franklin (Tasmania)|Franklin]] has a collection of locally-manufactured wooden boats alongside the Huon River. While the timber industry has mostly died out today, Huon pines were among one of the popular species of trees for timber harvesters during the 20th century.\\n\\n==Do==\\nThere are many hiking trails within the Huon and Far South, particularly within [[Southwest National Park]] and [[Hartz Mountains National Park]] \\u2013 see [[Tasmanian national parks]] and [[hiking and bushwalking in Australia]] for some advice for advice on [[cold weather]]. The most well-known out of all is '''South Coast Track'''.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nApple orchards and other fruit farms are the main draw of the Huon and Far South.\\n\\nOtherwise, much of the region has it similar to other parts of Tasmania in terms of restaurants. Fish and chips shops tend to be better further south, partially because the towns down south are bayside or oceanside, as opposed to being riverside.\\n\\n==Drink==\\nBars and taverns are like any other Tasmanian region.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n[[File:Ladies Tarn in Snow.jpg|thumb|300px|Never underestimate the cold in the Far South]]\\nLike in other Tasmanian regions (particularly West and Central), distances are not long, at least not when compared to mainland standards, but travel times should never be underestimated due to the winding nature of the region's roads. While a journey on the Huon Highway does not take a long time (about an hour from Huonville to Southport), a simple 25-km trip from Geeveston to Hartz Mountains can take up to 40 minutes (in other words, you'd be averaging about {{kmh|37.5}}), and a 30-km trip between Southport and Recherche Bay can take between 40\\u201345 minutes. Always plan some extra time in case you get bogged up by the region's windy roads.\\n\\nNever underestimate the cold: the temperature rarely tips above 20\\u00b0C, even on the best of summer days, and sub-zero temperatures are very common between April and October (and almost a daily occurrence in the mountains). Be prepared for the snow if you're hiking during the colder months and always carry a good jacket with you, even if it's summer.\\n\\nLike in other Tasmanian regions, watch out for wildlife. Road visibility at night is particularly poor in the Huon and Far South.\\n\\n==Go next==\\nThe only region that's connected to the Huon and Far South by road is the '''[[Greater Hobart]]''' region. Some good nearby destinations in this region close to the Huon Valley include '''[[Bruny Island]]''', home to lots of penguins and home to one of the last remaining populations of white wallabies. You may also wish to proceed further and drive northwest to the [[Derwent Valley]], home to impressive waterfalls in [[Mount Field National Park]] and some of the state's largest lakes in [[Southwest National Park|Southwest]] (the other side of the park), or explore [[West Coast Tasmania]].\\n\\n{{IsPartOf|Southern Tasmania}}\\n{{usableregion}}\\n{{geo|-43.294|146.9216|zoom=9}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Wallaroo_Banner.jpg}}\\n'''Wallaroo''' is a coastal town on the western side of [[Yorke Peninsula and Clare Valley|Yorke Peninsula]] in [[South Australia]] and is a popular tourist destination.  Along with [[Kadina]] and [[Moonta]], Wallaroo forms the [[Copper Coast]], formerly known as the Copper Triangle.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n\\nThe name Wallaroo comes from the Indigenous Australian Narungga word 'Wadlu Waru' meaning wallaby urine. The early British colonials tried to copy this word by calling it Walla Waroo, however they found this too big to stamp on the wool bales, so they shortened it to Wallaroo.\\n\\nWallaroo has a deep sea port, at which the Viterra grain terminal is located and ships dock to fill up with grain.

Each community [https://maigeiko.tumblr.com/post/185722195819/hai-first-of-all-beautiful-tumbler-page-the has its own traditions and distinctive appearance]; in some cases, such as in Kyoto, there are as many as five distinct geisha communities in the city. Each community is made up of a number of geisha houses (''okiya''), which function somewhat like a talent agency. Every geisha belongs to one, which handles their booking, training, and in some cases even provides their lodging. Hanamachi also have many ''o-chaya''; these \\\"tea houses\\\" are not for tea, but are private event spaces where patrons go to be entertained by geisha.\\n\\nIn the largest Japanese cities, it can be easy to spot a geisha if you look in the right part of town. That said, many of the people you may see on the streets are not actually geisha or maiko, but are just out for a stroll in a costume. Today there's a burgeoning industry of '''''henshin'' studios''', where Japanese and foreigners alike pay around \\u00a58,000-15,000 to be \\\"transformed\\\" for an hour or so, with extra charges for designer kimono or better photo shoots.

(Much of the ceremony is in contemplative silence punctuated by a few formal comments, but towards the end the lead guest will ask the host to describe the tea, servingware, and decorations.) While casual dress may be acceptable today at informal ceremonies, you should check if there's a dress code, and probably try to dress up a little anyway.

In [[Helsinki]], aurorae occur about once a month, and are usually masked by light pollution or clouds. Aurorae seen further outside of the auroral belts may also be much less vivid, with fewer colours.\\n\\n=== Cruise ships ===\\nA luxurious way to see the lights is to take a [[cruise ship]] along the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Alaska]], or toward [[Antarctica]] for the Southern Lights, in the appropriate season. Cruises tend to be expensive, but the costs may be quite reasonable compared to flying to a good site on land and paying for accommodation and tours there. Viewing the Lights by just strolling on deck after dinner is much more convenient than being driven somewhere to stand in the snow, and the chance of encounters with dangerous wildlife is lower. \\n\\nThere may be problems with this; not all cruise lines run in winter and it is ''extremely'' difficult to get good photos from a moving ship when the subject requires long exposures, as the lights generally do.

The Scandinavian brown bear is peaceful and will generally run away from humans. In any case it is extremely unlikely that tourists will even see a glimpse of one of the around 50 brown bears remaining in Norway. Norwegian wolves are not dangerous to humans.

One interesting experience in [[Kemi]] is going on an icebreaker cruise, which then allows passengers to disembark on the ice in the middle of the Bay of Bothnia. \\n\\nIf you want to experience the '''silence and darkness''' in earnest, rent a cottage away from cities and bigger roads, at a suitable distance from the nearest village and neighbours. As many summer cottages were built as homes or otherwise for year-round use, there are bargains to be found in many regions, at least if you can handle a more primitive one. Make sure outdoor lights can be switched off (or do not interfere too much with stargazing), and have a kerosene lamp and candles for more cosy lighting in the evening, and a lantern with a candle for a walk in the nightly forest.

If you come in the beginning of May some passes can be still closed, but since the snow is melting very quickly, you will get a possibility to enjoy plenty of waterfalls before they disappear.

In [[Helsinki]], aurorae occur about once a month, and are usually masked by light pollution or clouds. Aurorae seen further outside of the auroral belts may also be much less vivid, with fewer colours.\\n\\n=== Cruise ships ===\\nA luxurious way to see the lights is to take a [[cruise ship]] along the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Alaska]], or toward [[Antarctica]] for the Southern Lights, in the appropriate season. Cruises tend to be expensive, but the costs may be quite reasonable compared to flying to a good site on land and paying for accommodation and tours there. Viewing the Lights by just strolling on deck after dinner is much more convenient than being driven somewhere to stand in the snow, and the chance of encounters with dangerous wildlife is lower. \\n\\nThere may be problems with this; not all cruise lines run in winter and it is ''extremely'' difficult to get good photos from a moving ship when the subject requires long exposures, as the lights generally do.

In the national park, there are also similar locked and bookable huts.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nFor trekking, remember that you are in the Arctic.

Most would prefer the [[midnight sun]], which can be seen much of the summer, depending on where you stay.\\n\\nFor [[Sami culture]], you may want to check Hetta at a suitable festival. The national park visitor centre has relevant exhibitions year round.

As many summer cottages were built as homes or otherwise for year-round use, there are bargains to be found in many regions, at least if you can handle a more primitive one. Make sure outdoor lights can be switched off (or do not interfere too much with stargazing), and have a kerosene lamp and candles for more cosy lighting in the evening, and a lantern with a candle for a walk in the nightly forest.

In [[Helsinki]], aurorae occur about once a month, and are usually masked by light pollution or clouds. Aurorae seen further outside of the auroral belts may also be much less vivid, with fewer colours.\\n\\n=== Cruise ships ===\\nA luxurious way to see the lights is to take a [[cruise ship]] along the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Alaska]], or toward [[Antarctica]] for the Southern Lights, in the appropriate season. Cruises tend to be expensive, but the costs may be quite reasonable compared to flying to a good site on land and paying for accommodation and tours there. Viewing the Lights by just strolling on deck after dinner is much more convenient than being driven somewhere to stand in the snow, and the chance of encounters with dangerous wildlife is lower. \\n\\nThere may be problems with this; not all cruise lines run in winter and it is ''extremely'' difficult to get good photos from a moving ship when the subject requires long exposures, as the lights generally do. If the cruise is not specially for aurora viewing, chances are that light pollution from the ship itself is an issue.\\n\\n=== In flight ===\\n\", \"If you enjoy wilderness and solitude, e.g. areas around [[Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi]] and [[Karigasniemi]] might be good choices.

Intense aurorae occur for 5\\u201315 minutes at a time, so taking a look at the northern sky every now and then over a longer period will increase your chances.\\n\\nMany businesses arrange northern light watching tours. Usually the tours also have some other theme, such that not seeing the aurorae will not spoil it, but taking care of being in the right place would the aurorae be visible. A week of backcountry skiing will offer even better opportunities unless you spend the best hours in your tent or a hut. A hotel in Kakslauttanen has glass-domed igloo rooms where you can watch northern lights indoors the whole night.\\n\\n===Reindeer and snowmobiles===\\n[[File:Reindeer Ride.jpg|thumb|Reindeer ride near [[Ruka]]]]\\n\\nMost of Lapland belongs to the reindeer husbandry area, and nearly all wilderness is in use as reindeer pasture (mostly forested areas in winter and treeless areas in summer). \", \"Northern Lapland is one of the best places to observe aurorae, as it has good accessibility, high-quality accommodation and a nearly continental climate with relatively clear skies.

If you do not spot northern lights, you will at least get a tremendous view of stars, compared to what you see in most cities.\\n\\nTo have a good chance to see northern lights you should stay at least a few days, preferably a week or more, in the far north in the right season. Probability for aurorae and clear skies varies somewhat from place to place, but all of northern Lapland, about from Sodankyl\\u00e4 onwards, should be quite good. More importantly, as you need some luck and persistence, you want to go somewhere where you can enjoy yourself regardless. The ski resort of [[Saariselk\\u00e4]], easily accessible by plane and with plenty of facilities, is particularly popular among aurora hunters.
