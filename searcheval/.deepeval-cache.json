Inhaling the hallucinogenic spores, he saw an imprint of the planet Ahch-To and spoke to an imprint of the High Republic Era Jedi Master Elzar Mann. After their conversation, Skywalker received a sacred Jedi text from a skeleton of a dead Jedi.\\n\\nFollowing the Battle of Jakku, Luke Skywalker dedicated much of these years to finding the site of the first Jedi Temple. He uncovered many tantalizing clues that hinted at the origins of the Jedi, but the precise location was a mystery. He made use of the Jedi star compass he had discovered in the Emperor's Observatory on Pillio. With a plasma-encased supraluminite lodestone at its center, the compass functioned much like the ancient wayfinders and was attuned to specific points in hyperspace. Through studying the compass, Skywalker uncovered a path to Ahch-To, the site of Temple Island and the first Jedi temple.\\n\\nLieutenant Shara Bey of the Rebel Alliance assisted Skywalker in recovering two small uneti trees from Vetine, the only remains of the Great Tree that once grew within the training ground of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. The key to finding the island itself was his study of the spread of the Force-sensitive uneti saplings. \", \"After recovering the lightsaber from some porgs, Rey discovered Skywalker's X-wing starfighter within a shallow bay and learned that he had stranded himself on the planet. She continued to follow him across the island, despite being ordered to leave.\\n\\nEventually, she heard a hum of energy calling her to the old tree containing the sacred Jedi texts dating back to the dawn of the Jedi Order, emanating from the books. She claimed the location was familiar to her, and that she has seen it in her dreams. Intrigued, Skywalker asked Rey to elaborate, but she continued to press him to come out of hiding and help fight the First Order. Skywalker once more refused, explaining that he did not come to the planet to hide but to die where the Jedi Order first started. Afterward, the old Jedi Master pressed Rey for her true motives for coming to Ahch-To. Rey explained that she had a power inside of her that she did not understand and was frightened of; she also sought a mentor to help her discover her place in the galaxy.\\n\\nThe next night, the former Jedi Master slipped into the Millennium Falcon and recalled the adventures he had experienced. While aboard, Skywalker reunited with R2 who, after he insisted that he could not be convinced to help, replayed Leia's holographic message to Kenobi. \", \"The Jedi Order was founded on planet Ahch-To by the Prime Jedi around 25,025 BBY.

Some of them were kind, and others were mad\\u2014songs recalled years of fire and ruin that had forced the Lanais from their homes until things resumed their proper course. Due to its many secrets, the location of Ahch-To had been hidden from the galaxy.\\n\\nBefore the Great Jedi Purge and the Age of the Empire, Jedi scholars argued that a number of locations could be considered the birthplace of the Order. The scholars argued that Coruscant, Jedha, and Ossus as well as worlds shrouded in myth, such as Tython and Ahch-To could all be considered candidate worlds for the Order's birth and the location of the first Jedi temple. Despite such deliberation, however, the location of the first Jedi temple was a mystery by the time the Galactic Civil War came to a close.\\n\\nIn 3 ABY, Jedi-in-training Luke Skywalker visited the living planet Gazian in search of knowledge of the Jedi. After landing on a platform, Skywalker fell into the mushrooms of the Living Sea while attempting to venture out, losing his breathing mask. \", \"The cyborg explained that only he knew about the Hidden Hand's hideout as he deduced its position thanks to his old friend Cavic's advice, and that the rest of his team was killed on Heva. Valance stated that he tracked him down as revenge for his home's destruction. As Gwi prepared to fire his blaster, Vader and his forces, who tracked the beacon, arrived and assaulted the base. In the ensuing chaos, Valance quickly overpowered Gwi, aiming his own blaster at him. However, he was stopped by Vader as he lifted Gwi in the air, stating that the Emperor wished to interrogate him personally. As Vader and forces took Gwi away, Valance took this opportunity to escape back to Lowik.\\n\\nBack on Lowik, Gita asked Valance if he could stay and help the Rebellion alongside his people, who migrated from Chorin and escaped certain doom from the Empire. He refused, returning the gem to Vega that she gave him back when he left Chorin to become a pilot. Valance then traveled to Coruscant to meet his old rival Dengar, who boasted about his earnings to a crowd in the Galactic City. Upon meeting him, he struck Dengar in the face. A member of the crowd pointed out that he was part of his team back when they hunted Vader down, and asked him where he spent his credits. Valance clarified that his team was killed and Dengar had betrayed him. He explained that he used his credits on \\\"something stupid.\\\" \", \"Valance eventually became a cadet for the Empire at Carida Academy, the Imperial Naval Academy on the planet Carida in the star system of the same name. At the Imperial Academy, the Imperial cadets were referred to by their assigned operating numbers instead of their names, with Valance being known by the digits \\\"404-913.\\\" While he seemingly won the love of the Empire, due to his belief in beating others into submission to show he was the best, one of Valance's fellow cadets, Kanina Nico, particularly hated him, even more than she hated everyone else.\\n\\nValance came to dislike fellow cadet Han Solo, as he believed Solo was holding him back and viewed him as merely a Corellian scrumrat. At one point during training, Solo spoke out of turn to their training officer Lieutenant Triosa Broog. She responded by ordering the cadets to run up a mountain in full swamp trooper gear. In response to this, several cadets attacked Solo. Afterwards, Valance insulted Solo, claiming scrumrats like him did not belong in the navy. Before Valance could cause any serious physical harm, cadet Nico cut in and told him to let the other cadet go.\\n\\nWhile Solo was detained temporarily for trying to escape Carida in a TIE fighter, Valance climbed to the top of the cadet leader board, competing heavily with Nico. When Solo returned to see the leader board, he confronted him again. Solo tried to fight him, but was knocked to the ground by Valance. \", \"\\nDue to his blinding, Kanan retreated from the forefront to meditate in the Force. Two years before the Battle of Yavin, his apprentice Ezra took up a greater leadership role in the rebellion. Ezra led the Spectres on a mission to rescue the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka from the Imperial prison on Naraka. While Ezra's Force powers and combat skills had grown, his use of the Sith holocron strained relations with Kanan. After rescuing Hondo, the rebels learned that the Empire was dismantling old Y-wing starfighters at Reklam Station inside the gas planet of Yarma.\\n\\nWhile Ezra and his team undertook a recon mission to Reklam Station, Kanan encountered a powerful Force-wielded named the Bendu; who taught him to overcome his fears so that he could be there for Ezra. Meanwhile, Ezra disobeyed orders and ordered his team to steal the Y-wings without consulting with Hera and Commander Sato. Despite freeing the Ugnaught laborers and stealing the starfighters, Ezra's actions destroyed the Imperial junkyard and drew the attention of Grand Admiral Thrawn. The team managed to escape with the help of the Phoenix rebels, Hera, and Kanan, but the Phantom was destroyed. Due to his actions, Ezra was suspended from his position as Lieutenant Commander.\\n\\nLater, Maul kidnapped Hera, Zeb, Chopper, and Sabine and forced Kanan and Ezra to bring him the Sith holocron from Malachor and Kanan Jarrus' holocron. Maul hoped to combine the powers of the two. \", \"\\nLater, the Spectres disrupted the Empire Day celebrations in Lothal's Capital City and fled the planet with the Rodian fugitive Tseebo, an Imperial Information Office employee with classified information about the Empire. Pursued by the Grand Inquisitor, Kanan and Ezra detached the Phantom above Fort Anaxes while the other crew of the Ghost traveled with Tseebo to rendezvous with \\\"Fulcrum,\\\" who would ferry the fugitive to a safe place. Following a second confrontation with the Grand Inquisitor, Kanan decided that Ezra was ready for his Jedi Trials. The Master and his apprentice then departed to a hidden Jedi Temple on Lothal where Ezra passed his trials with the help of the Jedi Master Yoda and gained a kyber crystal, which he used to built his lightsaber.\\n\\nShort on cash and having accidentally bet on Chopper during a game of sabacc, Kanan and Hera reluctantly accepted a job run from the \\\"galactic entrepreneur\\\" Lando Calrissian to help him steal a puffer pig from the crime lord Azmorigan. After escaping Azmorigan, the Ghost broke through the Imperial blockade above Lothal with some difficulty after Ezra and Zeb accidentally released the puffer pig. After losing their TIE pursuers, the crew of the Ghost dropped Calrissian at his farm estate on Lothal where they fought off Azmorigan and his henchmen. As payment for their services, the rebels took Calrissian's fuel tanks.\\n\\n\", \"\\nSeveral months later, Kanan, Chopper, and Ezra scouted the planet Oosalon as the site of a potential rebel base. However, Kanan and Ezra were ambushed by two Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister. Despite escaping, Kanan realized that he and Ezra would be unable to help the rebellion as long as the Inquisitors were hunting them down. Together with Ahsoka, Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper left their comrades behind on the Ghost while they traveled on the Phantom to the Jedi Temple on Lothal to seek answers from Master Yoda on how to deal with the threat of the Inquisitors. On Lothal, Kanan passed his Jedi trials and became a Jedi Knight while Ezra met with Yoda. The Jedi and Chopper managed to escape before the Inquisitors and Darth Vader arrived.\\n\\nLater, the crew of the Ghost took part in a mission to steal fuel from the Imperial depot at Horizon Base. The Phoenix rebels had identified Berzite's moon in the Yost system as a potential site for a rebel base but the fleet's fighter-carrier lacked sufficient fuel to travel there. While Kanan, Hera, Ezra, Zeb, and Sabine raided the heist, Chopper was assigned to guard the ship. However, the droid neglected his duties and became distracted by a droid leg being sold. Despite stealing the fuel, the other rebels were forced to leave Chopper behind when he was nowhere to be found. \", \"\\nWhile on the planet, Valance lamented the attack on his village, stating that while the Empire abandoned the planet, he also abandoned his people. He told the story of how he returned to kill the raiders that laid waste to his home, but was too late as they had already left. He explained to Vader that the Hidden Hand was created as a result of these events. Vader stated that his people were still safe for the time being, and invited him back to the Empire. Valance later traveled to a rebel outpost on Lowik, where he met Gita and her commanding officer. He stated that he needed to meet the Hidden Hand while the Rebellion required weapons from them. He connected his arm to the terminal and displayed the location of a Hidden Hand outpost, claiming he knew where both he and the Rebellion could fulfill their goals.\\n\\nAs Valance approached the Hidden Hand's main base inside an asteroid field, he was captured, but not before placing a beacon that attracted the Empire's attention. He was brought before Gwi, who revealed himself to be the criminal syndicate's true leader. Furious over the failure of his mission to kill Vader, Gwi immediately began thrashing Valance. The cyborg explained that only he knew about the Hidden Hand's hideout as he deduced its position thanks to his old friend Cavic's advice, and that the rest of his team was killed on Heva. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.0 because the DAG traversal shows that the citation annotation was null at the TaskNode level, leading to a False verdict at the BinaryJudgementNode level due to the absence of a citation in the required formats [#] or [#, #], which resulted in a deterministic False verdict at the VerdictNode.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "local model", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "______________________\n| TaskNode | Level == 0 |\n*******************************\nLabel: None\n\nInstructions:\nExtract the citation annotation of format [#] or [#, #] used in the answer `actual_output`, if not ciation is present return null\n\ncitation annotation:\nnull\n \n \n__________________________________\n| BinaryJudgementNode | Level == 1 |\n************************************************\nLabel: None\n\nCriteria:\ntest whether `citation annotation` is present in the format [#] or [#. #] and not null\n\nVerdict: False\nReason: The citation annotation is null and does not match the required formats [#] or [#. #].\n \n \n________________________\n| VerdictNode | Level == 2 |\n**********************************\nVerdict: False\nType: Deterministic"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "local model", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}]}, "{\"actual_output\": \"Yoda's lightsaber had a bright green plasma blade [1].\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": \"Yoda's lightsaber had a bright green plasma blade\", \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"what color was yoda's light saber?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"# Indeera Stokes' lightsaber\\n\\nThe Jedi Indeera Stokes utilized a yellow-bladed lightsaber during the High Republic Era.\", \"# Kelleran Beq's lightsaber\\n\\nKelleran Beq's lightsaber was a green-bladed lightsaber wielded by the Jedi Master Kelleran Beq, who was nicknamed \\\"The Sabered Hand\\\" due to his skill with the Jedi weapon.

Though the crystals originally emitted a red blade, she purified them with the Force, turning them white. The hilts of the lightsabers were originally created from pieces of scrap metal that Tano had acquired over the year since the fall of the Republic, but were later modified to be more functional and decorative.\\n\\nShe first used the lightsabers in battle on Raada just after she had constructed them, rescuing her friend Kaeden Larte and covering the escape of the population of Raada onto arriving evacuation ships.

After the events on the Sith world, Ahsoka Tano continued to carry her two lightsabers throughout the Galactic Civil War and beyond.\\n\\n## Description\\n\\n\", \"# Ahsoka Tano\\n\\nAhsoka Tano was a female Togruta who was a Force-sensitive outcast from the Jedi Order. After the Clone Wars, she helped establish a network of various rebel cells against the Galactic Empire. Tano was discovered on her homeworld of Shili by Jedi Master Plo Koon, who brought her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to receive Jedi training. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda assigned the young Tano to be the Padawan learner of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who nicknamed her \\\"Snips\\\" when she joined him at the Battle of Christophsis. Whereas Tano was eager to prove herself, Skywalker had a reputation for recklessness, and they had a rather difficult start as master and apprentice. Yet they worked together to rescue Rotta, the son of crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and returned Rotta to his father, thus facilitating a crucial alliance between the Hutt Clan and the Galactic Republic.\\n\\nAs a commander in the Grand Army of the Republic, Tano found a mentor in Clone Captain Rex of the 501st Legion, with whom she and Skywalker collaborated to lead frontline campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In her first command position at the Battle of Ryloth, Tano disobeyed orders and lost her entire squadron of pilots, but she rebounded and helped secure a victory at Ryloth. \", \"Ahsoka Tano fled into the Outer Rim, intent on hiding from the Empire. Eventually, she found the planet Thabeska, a planet that dealt largely in small-scale water and technology trading, and one with a relatively small and unorganized population located far away from major hyperspace routes. Believing the rural world to be of little interest to the Empire, and a steady stream of newcomers would allow herself to blend into the quiet world, Tano made landing on Thabeska. However, the refugee did not account for the presence of the local Fardi clan, an influential family that either touched or ran most of Thabeska's businesses, including their own smuggling operations, though the family fronted such with several legal businesses. In time, Tano came to hear rumors that some kind of dark lord who was serving the Emperor and hunting Jedi, yet she was unable to confirm such reports.\\n\\nIn order to hide her identity, Tano took on the name \\\"Ashla,\\\" which was also the name of a moon that orbited the scared Jedi world of Tython, another term for the light side of the Force, and the name of a Jedi youngling from the Clone Wars-era. Upon arrival on Thabeska, Tano was greeted by several young girls. They showed her where she could find food and a place to stay, and introduced her to Fardi, who bought Ashla's ship for what she thought was a nearly decent price. \", \"Exhausted, Tano assumed that her attacker was Ventress, who had apparently changed her mind about taking her in. Offee was able to overpower Tano and disarm her before knocking her into a room full of boxes of the nanodroids used in the Temple attack, leading to her capture by the Coruscant Guard. Tano was subsequently put on trial for her alleged crimes after being expelled from the Jedi Order. Skywalker, investigating, tracked down Ventress and subsequently identified Offee as the true culprit. Tano was released after Offee confessed, but chose not to return to the Jedi, leaving her lightsabers in their possession.\\n\\nWhile the lightsabers were in the custody of the Jedi, Skywalker took care of them, taking the opportunity to, as he saw it, \\\"improve\\\" them. The blades changed color to blue as a result. Tano, during her time away from the temple, eventually allied herself with Mandalorian warrior Bo-Katan Kryze and her Nite Owls, who welcomed a Republic invasion of Mandalore as it would unseat the Sith Lord Maul, who had taken over the planet, installed a puppet government and murdered Duchess Satine. Tano made the decision to call on her former Master for help, and she reunited with him, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Captain Rex. However, when the two Jedi were abruptly called back to Coruscant to help the Supreme Chancellor, Skywalker left Rex and part of the 501st Legion to help her. He also returned the lightsabers to Tano.\\n\\n\", \"However, after being framed for treason by her former friend Barriss Offee, leading to her trial and near-execution, Tano lost faith in the Order and left, leaving her weapons behind. Late in the war, after joining up with Mandalorian warrior Bo-Katan Kryze and her Nite Owls, Tano received her lightsabers back from her former master Anakin Skywalker upon temporarily rejoining the Republic military to lead forces in the Siege of Mandalore. After winning the Siege and capturing the renegade Sith Lord Maul, Tano and Clone Commander Rex's journey back to Coruscant with their prisoner was disrupted by Darth Sidious' issuance of Order 66, which initiated the Great Jedi Purge. After freeing Maul as a distraction for the attacking clone troopers, Tano ambushed Rex and had his control chip removed. However, Maul's subsequent destruction of the hyperdrive of the Tribunal, the Venator-class Star Destroyer they were traveling on, caused the stricken starship to crash on a moon, with only Tano, Rex and Maul making it off beforehand. Afterwards, Tano abandoned her lightsabers by the graves she and Rex had dug for the clones who died in the crash to fake her death, before she and Rex parted ways to go into hiding.\\n\\nTano spent the next year in hiding on the planet Thabeska, working as a mechanic for the Fardi clan. After fleeing the planet on the first Empire Day, Tano, under the alias \\\"Ashla,\\\" wound up on the remote farming moon Raada. \", \"Tano wielded the lightsaber as she fought alongside her master in many battles, including crossing blades with the feared General Grievous on a mission to Skytop Station, fighting Count Dooku's assassin Asajj Ventress on several occasions, and using them in battles against Separatist forces on worlds like Maridun, Naboo, Felucia, and Geonosis. She also duelled with disguised Clawdite bounty hunter Cato Parasitti after the shapeshifter had disguised herself as Chief Librarian Jocasta Nu during an infiltration of the Jedi Temple, noting that Parasitti lacked the skill of the woman she was impersonating and defeating her easily. Her master temporarily dual-wielded both her lightsaber with his own against two super battle droids led by Cad Bane on a Munificent-class star frigate in the Devaron System in order to save her. He also used only it after Ahsoka let him borrow it to defend himself when his lightsaber was taken during the Battle of Mon Cala. Tano later fought her fellow Padawan Barriss Offee after the Mirialan had been infected by a Geonosian brain worm while travelling to the Ord Cestus medical station on the frigate TB-73.\\n\\nOne mission on Coruscant had Tano waiting on watch outside a cantina in slum district G17 while Skywalker went inside to arrest arms dealer Car Affa. \", \"The following day, after mistaking him for an enemy and attacking him with her white sabers, Ahsoka gained the help of Din Djarin, and she was able to infiltrate the magistrate's sanctuary. Armed with a spear of pure beskar, Elsbeth engaged Tano in combat, and even managed to knock one of her lightsabers into a pond. Tano, left with only her shoto, still gained the upper hand and disarmed Elsbeth, and demanded the whereabouts of Grand Admiral Thrawn. In defeating Elsbeth, Ahsoka ended the magistrate's rule of Calodan, and set free its oppressed villagers, but Elsbeth was later freed from New Republic custody by two hired mercenaries, former Jedi Baylan Skoll and his apprentice, Shin Hati.\\n\\nTano continued to wield her lightsabers as she reunited with Wren and continued her search for Thrawn with Huyang and her Padawan. In that time, Tano used her lightsabers against Elsbeth's HK-87 assassin droids and scout guards, the former Inquisitor Marrok, and Skoll. In the end, Tano and Wren would discover Thrawn and Bridger on the extragalactic planet Peridea, where Tano engaged in a second duel against Skoll and, together with Bridger and Wren, fought Thrawn's Night Troopers in an effort to prevent his escape from Peridea. In that battle, the Night Troopers were slain but risen from the dead by Thrawn's allies, the Nightsisters known as the Great Mothers, which left the Night Troopers able to rise after lightsaber strikes or deflected blaster bolts. \", \"The two would often butt heads, each believing that they knew better than the other. During their first mission together at the Battle of Christophsis, they developed demeaning nicknames for each other; Tano gave her master the diminutive title \\\"Skyguy,\\\" while Skywalker returned the favor with the name \\\"Snips,\\\" referring to Tano's snippy wit. Tano used the nickname Skyguy only because it annoyed Skywalker, although, as the war progressed, these nicknames would remain by changing into more playful terms of friendship. Skywalker also quickly came to respect Tano's bravery and determination, and he recognized that Tano was just as reckless as him.\\n\\nFor all their bickering, the two developed a close relationship during the Clone Wars. Skywalker reassured his Padawan that their meeting was no accident and that it was the will of the Force for her to train under him. Their rapport made it's way onto the battlefield, with the duo competing to see who could destroy the most droids during the Second Battle of Geonosis. The master and apprentice grew increasingly reliant on each other throughout the war, taking turns rescuing each other from Separatist forces and bounty hunters. After situations where she was nearly killed, she found that she could talk to her mentor to come to terms with it. Tano's naive outlook balanced with Skywalker's cynical approach. During her time on Mortis, Tano was killed by the Son and only resurrected after Skywalker pleaded with the Father to help save her. \", \"\\nTano was subsequently arrested, but Offee then assisted in her escape in a way that made her look guilty, including Tano finding her lightsabers on the floor and then later finding several clone troopers who had been killed with such a weapon. During her flight, Tano lost her shoto before escaping into an underworld portal. While on the run on Level 1313, Tano encountered Ventress, who had become a bounty hunter after being disowned by Dooku and wanted to try and collect the sizeable bounty on Tano's head. After Tano talked her into an alliance by pointing out the similarities in their positions and that the Jedi and Republic would be unlikely to reward her since she was wanted for crimes committed during her time with the Separatists, Ventress helped Tano non-lethally fight off the clone troopers sent after her. Tano also contacted Offee, unaware of her duplicity, and was thus lured into a trap at an abandoned munitions warehouse.\\n\\nAfter parting ways with the fugitive Padawan, Ventress was ambushed by Offee, who stole her mask and lightsabers after knocking her unconscious.

Without alterations to the template, the clone would be an exact duplicate of its progenitor. By manipulating the genetic structure of the template, a clone's genotype could be modified for various purposes such as growth acceleration and greater docility.\\n\\nA single genetic sample taken from an original organism was sufficient to grow millions of clones. Host samples degraded over time, however, making the donor essential for replacement samples. The cloning process could be sustained without the original host, but only by rationing the last viable samples of DNA. Eventually a new template would have to be selected in order to grow more clones.\\n\\n\", \"Around ten years prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas ordered the clone army for the Republic, having had visions of a future conflict.

Fett's clones were developed as embryos that the Kaminoans kept in growth jars during the initial stage of their creation. The Kaminoans modified the clones by using an accelerated growth process to increase the human aging rate, ensuring that the first generation would be ready for deployment within a decade of their inception. While Kaminoans such as Prime Minister Lama Su and his aide Taun We regarded the clone army as a testament to their people's reputation as experts in cloning, Fett took no pride in his cloned progeny as in his view they were grown to be disposable assets.\\n\\nThe Sith, having secretly co-opted the clone trooper program after Sifo-Dyas' death, instructed the Kaminoans to implant a behavioral modification biochip in the brain of every clone trooper.

The ensuing battle was a decisive victory for the alliance; Viceroy Nute Gunray was captured by Amidala herself, as such, the liberation of Naboo was achieved.

Maul planned to free the Sith Lord and watch them come after both Sidious and Vader in accordance to the Rule of Two. Unfortunately, Maul's attempts were unsuccessful.\\n\\nThen, he moved further inside the castle, sensing a powerful energy, and interacted with General Grievous, who was waiting for him, pouncing from the ceiling, his four lightsabers bearing down on him.

First, Sith apprentice Darth Maul was dispatched by his master, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, to the planet Tatooine, where he clashed with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Afterward, Sidious dispatched Maul to Naboo, where he killed Jinn but was himself cut down by Jinn's Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Formally, she was simply a Sith acolyte and Sith assassin known also as a Dark Acolyte. However, Ventress's ultimate dream was to be seen as a true Sith with the title of Sith Lord. Indeed, Dooku secretly told her they could overthrow Sidious to rule the galaxy themselves and trained her as a Sith apprentice who would help in overthrowing Sidious. As Dooku's disciple, Ventress served him as a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems with ranks such as Supreme Leader and commander during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Dooku's Confederacy, a war that fed into the Sith Order's Grand Plan.

He later tried to turn the undercover Jedi Master Quinlan Vos to the dark side, believing they could overthrow Sidious together as master and apprentice. Unlike his other two disciples, the Count told him he would be a proper Dark Lord of the Sith. However, Vos would betray Tyranus after the latter killed his lover Ventress with Force lightning.\\n\\nTyranus remained Sidious' apprentice while Opress' training was continued by his brother Maul. Their claim to the mantle of the Sith led the true Dark Lord to confront his former apprentice, resulting in Opress' death and Maul's capture. Sidious ultimately sacrificed and betrayed Tyranus in favor of a younger and stronger apprentice who had more potential, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker who was also the Chosen One destined to bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith. After manipulating Anakin with promises to grant him the power to save his wife and convincing him that the Jedi were holding him back, Sidious managed to turn Skywalker to the dark side. Skywalker pledged his allegiance to Sidious, becoming a Sith apprentice under the name of Darth Vader.\\n\\n\", \"\\nFollowing the infighting among the Sith, the surviving Sith Lord Darth Bane created the Rule of Two, stating that there shall only be two; a master to embody the power and an apprentice to crave it. Bane then took an apprentice, Darth Zannah, who was able to evade the Jedi Order when they apparently killed Bane, although it was rumored that Zannah herself killed Bane in a lightsaber duel on Ambria. Believed extinct by the Jedi, the Sith endured and carried on the tradition for over a millennium. Over the centuries of secret actions against the Jedi, Sith apprentices had the custom of using special starships known as Sith Infiltrators.\\n\\nSometime before the Invasion of Naboo, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious was trained by Darth Plagueis. Together they sought to achieve immortality and control the galaxy as equal rulers of a new Sith Empire. However, Sidious betrayed and murdered Plagueis in his sleep after learning everything he needed from him. The Sith and their practices continued through Sidious and his own apprentice, Darth Maul, son of the Nightsister Mother Talzin.\\n\\nDuring Maul's training, Sidious brought him to Malachor, a planet that had been scourged by the conflict between the ancient Jedi and Sith. \", \"\\nInstead, a Sith acolyte was\\u2014at least in theory\\u2014only provided with limited training to serve as a lesser agent who could never arise against the true two Sith: rather than act as one of the Sith Lords, a Sith acolyte acted under their command and carried out what the Sith apprentice Darth Tyranus once disparagingly described as \\\"grunt work.\\\" Furthermore, a Sith acolyte could be disposed of once they had outlived their usefulness or had grown too powerful. Due to the deceptive nature of the Sith, however, it was more than possible the Sith apprentice would attempt to train an acolyte to overthrow their master, with plans to take that title for themselves and turn their acolyte into a true Sith apprentice. Tyranus, for example, trained his acolyte Asajj Ventress as a Sith apprentice and told her they would overthrow his own master, the Sith Master Darth Sidious, to rule the galaxy themselves until Sidious sensed Ventress's growing power and ordered her eliminated, to which Dooku reluctantly complied.\\n\\nThe Stranger's Sith acolyte Mae-ho \\\"Mae\\\" Aneiseya\\\" also served as a Sith assassin, as did Ventress.

Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.\\n\\nC-3PO was rebuilt from spare parts by Anakin Skywalker, a human slave who lived in Mos Espa, a city on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. During the Clone Wars, he would serve the Naboo Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. Shortly after the Clone Wars, C-3PO's memory was erased, though R2-D2's memory was not. C-3PO and R2-D2 were assigned to the Alderaan cruiser Tantive IV, where they served senator Bail Organa for nineteen years, assisting in his fledgling resistance movement against the Galactic Empire. At some point during this time, C-3PO's right leg was fitted with mismatched plating.\\n\\nC-3PO remained constant companions with R2, and in 0 BBY, the pair became embroiled in the Galactic Civil War when Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance entrusted them to bring a copy of the Death Star plans to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. \", \"A Senatorial protocol droid trailed after Senator Dantum Roohd aboard Duchess Satine Kryze's starship, the Coronet, as it ferried a delegation led by Kryze from the world of Mandalore to Coruscant. At another point, a blue-white model followed Senator Mee Deechi through the corridors of the Senate Office Building. During a meeting with Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala about the Confederate\\u2013Republic peace initiative, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was supplied a beverage by a Senatorial protocol droid at the Chancellor's Suite. Jedi Ahsoka Tano and Vice Chair Mas Amedda were also present, although none consumed the drinks offered.\", \"C-3PO was known for his polite, fastidious, and worry-prone personality. As a droid, he exhibited much loyalty and commitment to his masters and sought to serve them to his best ability. Throughout his operational life, C-3PO worked diligently for several masters including Anakin Skywalker, Padm\\u00e9 Amidala, Bail Organa, and Luke Skywalker. As a protocol droid, C-3PO could communicate in over seven million different forms of communication. This allowed him to communicate with computer systems including those on the Millennium Falcon. Pit droid WAC-47 found C-3PO to be a \\\"handsome fella.\\\"\\n\\nUnlike his best friend and astromech counterpart, R2-D2, C-3PO liked to stick to routine and did not respond well to change. When placed in danger, C-3PO had a tendency to panic as shown on several occasions, including infiltrating a droid foundry on Geonosis and a mission to steal Imperial disruptors on Lothal. Despite his loyalty and commitment, C-3PO was generally unable to lie or to keep secrets due to his programming. In fact, after the Hijacking of the Harbinger, during which Task Force 99 captured him, they remarked to Darth Vader that they were unable to get him to shut up. Despite the droid's talkative nature, he was able to keep Anakin and Padm\\u00e9's marriage secret. C-3PO's inability to lie came at a disadvantage when he and his companions were captured by Ewoks prior to the Battle of Endor. \", \"C-3PO's inability to lie came at a disadvantage when he and his companions were captured by Ewoks prior to the Battle of Endor. Due to his general inability to keep secrets, Bail Organa arranged for him to receive a memory wipe in order to preserve the secret of Anakin and Padm\\u00e9's offspring, Luke and Leia.\\n\\nThreepio's programming, focused on etiquette and protocol, impacted his personality and limited his behavior in several other ways. On Endor, he found it difficult to impersonate a deity due to his programming, and during the attack on the Resistance fleet, he attempted to leave a mutiny in progress because it was not correct protocol.\\n\\nC-3PO continued serving Leia Organa in her careers as New Republic senator and subsequently Resistance General. C-3PO managed General Organa's Resistance droid spy network. Despite not being able to run or fight, C-3PO bravely stayed behind to hold back the First Order Agent Terex so that Poe Dameron and the spy droid N1-ZX could flee deeper into the caves. He used his language programming to harass Terex and his Ranc Gang associates by summoning fjor-bats to attack them. C-3PO quipped that he was expendable and could be rebuilt.\\n\\n## Equipment\\n\\nC-3PO was a 3PO-series protocol droid, who stood at a height of 1.77 meters and weighed 75 kilograms. He had a masculine programming and had experienced at least two memory wipes throughout his operational life. \", \"Despite Calrissian's outrage, Organa reluctantly ordered for the transmissions to continue. C-3PO provided the talky with a new series of emergency communications, and the ancient droid complied, again recommending that another hybroid be prepared.

Dameron recovered and led Calrissian away, with Organa instructing C-3PO to continue.\\n\\nHowever, C-3PO revealed that he had successfully compiled the Trawak language based on the talky's messages, thus being able to encode further communications without its help. The talky was incredulous, believing no droid could reconstruct Trawak due to its complexity. C-3PO informed the talker droid that he was far more advanced than it and criticized its self-interest before thanking the talky for its service and deactivating it. With the talky powered down and Lobot having survived the ordeal, Organa ordered for the ancient droid to be placed in storage.\\n\\nCalrissian, concluding as a result of the incident that the Rebellion did not care for him or Lobot, decided to sell the talker droid, and thus the key to the rebels' new communications, to the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, to whom he owed a debt.

Lobot, entering the room to face the talker droid, managed to connect with the droid and reorganize its circuits, removing the corruption from within it.\\n\\nUpon awakening, the talker droid asked who the rebels were. C-3PO spoke with the ancient droid, informing it that it had awoken in the future and requesting that the linguistics droid prepared its Trawak language module for download. The droid refused, to C-3PO's surprise, not wishing to surrender the one reason that it had been brought back online. Interrupting C-3PO's outrage, Calrissian reminded the talker droid that it was functioning solely because of Lobot, who could undo what he had done to fix the droid. Calrissian offered to have Lobot keep the droid online in return for the droid translating for the rebels. Princess Leia Organa informed the droid of the ongoing war, asking that the talker droid encode the Rebellion's communications into Trawak.\\n\\nThe talker droid accepted the rebels' terms, agreeing to work for them as long as Lobot helped it work around the corruption in its processing unit. \", \"\\n3PO-series droids were a modern model of protocol droid that succeeded the likes of the ancient Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II. Known as the \\\"talker droid\\\" or \\\"talky,\\\" the Autonomous Translator Module had its heyday but, in time, fell out of use. Despite being used as a protocol droid, the talky lacked the diplomacy modules seen in later protocol droids. While he knew the talky to be a predecessor to his own model, 3PO unit C-3PO regarded the talky as an inelegant, blocky design. Indeed, by the time of the 3PO-series, droid design had been streamlined instead of remaining like that of the talky.\\n\\n3PO droids in the Senate Office Building of the capital planet Coruscant served as aides, carrying drinks for senators, including the Supreme Chancellor.

Aware of the Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II's existence, C-3PO suggested that the rebels use its knowledge of Trawak as the basis for a new code. In order to do so, the Rebellion planned a mission to steal the droid from the Imperial Museum, dispatching a team of Pathfinders, accompanied by the cyborg Lobot and former Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian.\\n\\nAfter learning of the droid's location within the private collection, the rebels drew the curator out and kept him distracted so that Lobot could slice the door and allow them to break in.

As a result of Amidala's death and Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force, the Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family of Alderaan while Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star.

One of her first missions during the early days of the Imperial Era, the Ninth Sister accompanied Darth Vader, the Sixth Brother, and the Tenth Brother to the planet Mon Cala to hunt the Jedi Padawan Ferren Barr. Later, she accompanied the Second Sister to hunt down the fugitive Padawan Cal Kestis, who defeated her in a duel on Kashyyyk.

A former scavenger from the planet Jakku, her life was changed by the tumultuous events of the last days of the New Republic Era. Rey's decision to help the droid BB-8 set her on a course to discovering the Force that awakened within her, leading her to seek out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker for training. Yet despite her commitment to the Jedi Order and the light side of the Force, Rey felt the pull to the dark side due to her anger as well as the adversarial relationship she had with Ben Solo, a fallen Jedi whom she knew as the dark warrior Kylo Ren of the First Order. The unique Force-bond between them was a result of their nature as a dyad in the Force.\\n\\nRey was born on Hyperkarn in 15 ABY during the rise of the New Republic. Her father, Dathan, was a bioengineered Strand-Cast cloned from the genetic template of Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who ruled the Galactic Empire as Emperor Palpatine until his death and resurrection following the Battle of Endor.

Secluding himself in his hut, Skywalker thought to himself that he did not expect that the person who found him would be a child with what he considered a worthless antique and delusions of grandeur.\\n\\nLater, Luke was folding his old clothes then heard Rey trying to reach out to him again by knocking on his door but he told her to go away. However, Luke was surprised when his door broke open but was even more surprised to see his old friend Chewbacca was with her. Hearing how they got to where he was with the Millennium Falcon, Luke asked where Han was. Rey and Chewbacca told him that his old friend and brother-in-law was dead, murdered by Kylo Ren, which stunned Skywalker. Feeling regret for not having sensed his brother-in-law's death because he had disconnected himself from the Force, Luke was comforted by the Wookiee, who hugged him, before Skywalker comforted Chewbacca back.\\n\\nWhile hiking the island with a backpack, Skywalker noticed the sacred uneti tree on the island and decided to go inside it. There he found Rey, who had discovered several original texts of Jedi teachings hidden there. Skywalker learned that she had the Force within her and sought assistance to understand it and her place in the galaxy. \", \"Her recognition of these abilities and her destiny coincided with turbulence in the Cosmic Force, which for years had remained dormant, and ultimately led her to find Skywalker. The years that she spent on Jakku also proved useful when faced with Skywalker's obstinacy; having learned the value of patience, Rey remained on Ahch-To despite the old Jedi Master's refusal of her entreaty, determined to wear him down. Their time became a battle of wits, as Skywalker and Rey were equally stubborn. When she found Skywalker short on answers, Rey improvised on her own, which was what she did best.\\n\\nFor years, Rey remained optimistic and hopeful that her parents would return for her, wearing the same hairstyle and style of clothing that she had when they'd left her in the hopes that they'd recognize her when they came back. The question of who they were haunted her while on Ahch-To, and was left with feelings of disappointment and even greater loneliness when she found no answers. She was distraught when Kylo Ren led her to believe that her parents had been mere junk traders who sold their daughter for drinking money. The truth that she was Palpatine's granddaughter, however, had an even greater effect on her. She began to believe that, as a Palpatine, she was innately evil, and attempted to isolate herself on Ahch-To as Skywalker had, for the good of the galaxy. \", \"She exclaimed that she should have been the one checking it out and sending back a report.

They had taken a bounty on Vader unknowingly placed by someone from the very heart of the Republic Executive Building on Coruscant. They set off an ion grenade to disable everyone weapons but their own and destroyed his lightsaber, leading Vader to contact the Ninth Sister to request her to bring him her lightsaber. However, the Ninth Sister ignored the call, blaming the ion pulse for frying her comm.\\n\\nEventually, the family was forced to withdraw from the fight as their ray shields would eventually run out, and Vader had begun killing the patrons of the bar to prevent the family from attacking him. As the assassins fled the bar, they held the Ninth Sister at blaster point until family member Ramat Cha acquired and started up a speeder bike. After the family escaped, Vader arrived and accused the Ninth Sister of attempting to have him killed. \", \"She then heard a rumble, and activated a lightsaber as a massive creature came out of the junk and attacked her. Rey knew she couldn't fend it off alone, so she ran, getting into a Firespray gunship. She used the ship to escape the creature and land back to confront Ara-Nea. She realized that the whole Necropolis was a trap crafted by Ara-Nea to swindle people out of their money, then kill them. Right as a furious Ara-Nea was going to kill her, Rey used her iconic mind trick on Ara-Nea and made the alien surrender to his enslaved workers and be willing to be imprisoned. After completing repairs to the Falcon, she continued on her journey to Ahch-To.\\n\\nAfter landing on one of the planet's small islands, Rey ventured throughout the island's ancient ruins and found the old Jedi Master in seclusion. Skywalker said nothing as Rey arrived with his long-lost lightsaber in her hand and hope in her eyes. Upon offering Skywalker the saber, Rey was shocked to see him discard the weapon after briefly examining it, as he hoped to lose it once again. Skywalker immediately left the plateau, with Rey desperately tried to recruit Skywalker to help the remaining members of the Resistance the entire way down, which he blatantly refused to do. \", \"\\nIn the years following the fall of the Galactic Empire, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker traveled the galaxy to rediscover the history of the Jedi Order that had been suppressed by the Empire. In his search for knowledge, Skywalker became aware of the Ninth Sister's existence.

After the destruction of the Sith, Luke Skywalker attempted to restore the Jedi Order by training a new generation of Jedi. Although his plans were ruined by Ben Solo's fall to the dark side of the Force, Skywalker passed his knowledge on to a final apprentice, a scavenger from Jakku known as Rey.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nMembers of the Jedi Order trained in the ways of the Force.

Through Jinn, Kenobi eventually learned the ability to manifest his consciousness after death, a skill he would later put to good use to guide and counsel his apprentice, Luke Skywalker, during the Galactic Civil War.\\n\\nObi-Wan Kenobi proved himself to be a great military strategist and a highly studious man, demonstrating good knowledge on galactic history and conventions of war, like the Yavin Code. General Kenobi personally led his troops to many famous victories during the Clone Wars, and his persuasive demeanor earned him the moniker of \\\"The Negotiator.\\\"\\n\\nDespite his dislike of flying, Kenobi was an excellent pilot.

Possessing the wisdom and teachings of his own masters, Skywalker tried to educate his young student through the ways of the Force. Telling tales of Master Yoda onto Grogu, the young Jedi Master passed on what he had learned, echoing Yoda's words \\\"size matters not\\\" and to do, not try. However, Skywalker strived to make impression on his small student, having to stop him from using the Force to eat creatures and let Grogu use the Force as he did. Knowing that knowledge lied in Grogu's memory, Luke offered to help him remember and placed his hands gently on the alien's head. Seeing the traumatic images of the 501st Legion gunning down three Jedi Knights protecting the Padawan, everything faded to black when the clones killed the Jedi and moved towards Grogu. When his student awoke, Luke greeted his return and began to better understand the turmoil and subsequent reluctance of Grogu towards his lessons.\\n\\nWhile carrying Grogu on his back as he had done with Yoda on Dagobah, Skywalker felt the presence of the Mandalorian, Din Djarin. \", \"He continued his training in the years that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in Grand Master Yoda.

However, after Ben Solo's fall, he blamed Kenobi and Yoda for his lack of knowledge on how to permanently stamp out the dark, feeling that his err in teaching led to his student's demise as Kylo Ren.\\n\\nKenobi also spoke to Leia on occasion, as she heard his voice throughout the years of her life. While on Ahch-To, after Luke Skywalker reconnected to the Force, he felt Kenobi's spirit, along with Yoda, and his father Anakin with him again and felt comfort in that. Sometime after as Skywalker was dying, he thought he heard the familiar voice of Kenobi urging him to let go and he did, joining Kenobi, Yoda, and his father in the Force.\\n\\nThirty years later, Obi-Wan spoke to the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey in the voice of his younger self during a vision she received upon touching the lightsaber that previously belonged to Luke Skywalker, and Anakin before him. Obi-Wan called out to Rey, telling her that these were her first steps, and that the Force would be with her in her fight against the dark side.\\n\\nOne year later in 35 ABY, during the Battle of Exegol, Kenobi's voice was again heard by Rey among the voices of many Jedi of the past who aided her with destroying the resurrected Darth Sidious once and for all. \", \"Ultimately, the rumor was a trap to lure fugitive Jedi to the Grand Inquisitor.

Concerned by Bridger's ability to harness the dark side, Jarrus warned him to not lose control of his emotions.\\n\\nApproximately two decades after the Galactic Empire rose to power, Luke Skywalker embarked on a journey to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him. He was initially trained by Anakin Skywalker's former Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who taught Luke how to sense the Force through his feelings. However, their time together as Master and apprentice was cut short by Kenobi's death at the hands of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, forcing the young Skywalker to continue his Jedi training alone. After communing with the Force spirit of Kenobi, Skywalker traveled to Dagobah, where he discovered Yoda, the ancient Grand Master of the Jedi Order. But Yoda was initially discouraged by Skywalker's attitude, seeing much of Anakin's impatience and anger in Luke. After some consideration and Kenobi's endorsement, Yoda chose to overlook Skywalker's age as well as his penchant for adventure and excitement in order to complete his training.\\n\\nSkywalker and Yoda were often at odds throughout their time together, with the latter trying to teach his apprentice to be calm and in control of his developing Jedi abilities. Yet Skywalker remained reckless, cutting short his training to confront Darth Vader. \", \"Yet Skywalker remained reckless, cutting short his training to confront Darth Vader. As a result, he suffered an agonizing defeat in battle against the Dark Lord of the Sith, who revealed his former identity as the boy's father, Anakin Skywalker. By the time Luke returned to Dagobah to finish his Jedi training, Yoda had become ill and was on the verge of becoming one with the Force. Yoda told Skywalker that, while he required no further formal training, he had to confront his father one last time in order to finally become a true Jedi. Skywalker not only passed his final test, but also inspired Vader to turn away from the dark side, destroying the Sith and fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One.\\n\\nWith the Sith defeated, Luke Skywalker wandered the galaxy searching for knowledge that could help restore the Jedi Order. He trained his sister Leia Organa in the ways of the Force until she ceased her training to protect her son, Ben Solo, from the death she had foreseen would come if she continued down that path. Skywalker went onto train the former Jedi youngling Grogu on the planet Ossus, where he used ant droids to contruct a new Jedi school. Grogu soon left the temple to reunite with his guardian Din Djarin and take up the life of a Mandalorian.\\n\\nIn addition to a dozen other students, Skywalker trained his nephew Ben in the Jedi arts on Ossus. \", \"\\nTen years later, Kenobi left exile to rescue Leia Organa, Luke's twin sister, and was pursued by the Empire's Inquisitorius and Vader himself. Later, Kenobi was hunted down once again by Maul, whom he finally slew to protect the young Luke. Kenobi began the boy's Jedi training in 0 BBY, and soon after encountered Vader aboard the first Death Star, where he sacrificed himself to ensure that Luke and his allies escaped from the Sith Lord. In death, Kenobi became one with the Force which allowed him to continue guiding Luke throughout the Galactic Civil War. In 4 ABY, Kenobi reunited with his former student, Anakin Skywalker, who died destroying his Sith Master in order to save his son. Kenobi was remembered as a legendary Jedi Master during the rise of the New Republic; Ben Solo, the son of Luke's twin sister, Princess Leia Organa, was named after Kenobi. Solo's turn to the dark side left Luke disillusioned with the Jedi Order's legacy, and he held Kenobi responsible for Anakin's transformation into Vader.

He and Luke immediately disliked each other: Solo found Luke irritating and overly eager, and his open disdain for Kenobi's beliefs and actions did little to change Luke's initial view of Solo as an extortionist. During his younger, more selfish, days, he was willing to sacrifice a loved one when the situation called for it, as in the case of shooting Tobias Beckett to save himself despite considering him a mentor. However, he came to change as he met Luke Skywalker and the Rebellion. After Han demonstrated his bravery on the Death Star and proved his loyalty, they became genuine friends, and soon after, Han became loyal to the Rebellion.

They also asked Han why he had signed up, with Solo simply replying that he had to get off Corellia. Lyttan and Tamu said that he would never learn how to fly at the academy and that they might send him to a wretched place like Urthak or Mimban. Han was thinking about what they said and thought that he should do something deeply stupid. Han then snuck into a TIE fighter hanger and stole a fighter.

Han suggested that Valance and Han should start over. Han told Valance his name, but Valance refused to give his. He said to look on the leader board to find out. Han looked and saw that Valance was the top one on the board. Soon after, Han said he could not believe that the academy let Valance actually become the top one. Nico came up behind Han and said she wondered how long he would last. She was also surprised that Han survived the crash. Tamu then told Han that there was no way Han was moving to top of the leader board. Han disagreed.\\n\\nLater during flight school, Han asked the instructor if there would be flying at any point.

The Empire began to intensify its search for the Rebel base after the ambush of a rebel convoy at Derra. As part of Project Swarm, the Empire sent Viper probe droids to search for the rebel base throughout the galaxy. Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra heavily set back the Empire's efforts to find Echo Base when, by hacking into Vader's armor while the Sith Lord was weakened in the Martyrium of Frozen Tears, she had numerous probe droid records deleted or altered. By her own estimate, as well as that of the Empire when it set out to untangle the mess she left them with, it would take weeks to recover the project's lost ground.\\n\\nShortly before the battle, a strategy conference was held at the base after the arrival of several transports arrived, which were rumored to carry Princess Leia Organa, General Carlist Rieekan, Commander Chiffonage, a Bothan spy, and several other members of Alliance Command. \", \"The Galactic Empire tracked the Rebels to Yavin 4 and attempted to destroy the moon with the Death Star, a deep-space mobile battle station capable of destroying entire planets, in 0 BBY.

The Rebels eventually decided to establish their new base of operations on the ice planet Hoth in 1 ABY, with the Rebellion then spending the next two years building what became Echo Base. Over those two years, rebel engineers expanded ice caverns in a feat of engineering work.

During that mission, an Rebel Alliance Special Forces soldier named Purpruff traveled to the planet of Hoth in the Anoat sector and filed a report on it.

Hoth was continually pelted by meteors from its asteroid belt. Designed to be evacuated at a moment's notice, the base was hastily constructed, and often as not, wampa ice creatures would sneak into the base at night, forcing the closures of various corridors. Additionally, a specially reinforced chamber was constructed to hold multiple wampas. During the battle of Hoth, several snowtroopers ignored the sign and went into the room anyway, only to be slain by the icy creatures.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nEarly in the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance base made its home in the Great Temple on Yavin 4, the fourth moon of the planet Yavin.

Anakin reminded Luke that he could divert the path of the Force if he needed to, and that no matter how dark things seemed he was never alone as long as he allowed the Force to be his guide. Anakin then disappeared and left Luke alone until he heard the sound of a ship flying overhead and landing. It was Lando Calrissian, in the Lady Luck, who greeted Luke, but immediately told him that he needed to leave and that it was too dangerous for him to be there. But Calrissian told him that Lor San Tekka had told him where he was because Calrissian had information about the Sith, and also believed they were back.\\n\\nCalrissian brought Skywalker onto his ship and explained that overheard an assassin named Ochi of Bestoon who had become inebriated at a remote bar bragging that he had been sent by a Sith remnant to kidnap a girl from her parents. Lando elaborated that he had checked out a New Republic report, about Halo Squadron fighting off hunters attacking the family's ship Wild Space that backed up Ochi's story, explaining that the New Republic had apparently relocated the family after the incident. He then displayed a hologram of a hex charm that the family had been carrying as proof that they were being hunted by the Sith. \", \"She introduced herself as Gretta and claimed that she saved his life, pointing out a blaster behind the counter.

She told him that there was kyber near and told him that she had to kill the people there because she knew he would not. Skywalker was still upset that she killed everyone there, insisting they died for nothing and urging her to live a better life before leaving. Skywalker went off to look for crystals on the planet, sensing she had told the truth about there being some there, but she called after him and told him he was going the wrong direction. He saw she had a speeder with her and urged him to let her help him, explaining that she was from Jedha and that her people were the Fallanassi.

The book recounted that Jedi Master Luminara Unduli had been a mentor to Tano.\\n\\nDuring the Battle of Exegol in 35 ABY, the last Jedi, Rey, fell in combat against the resurrected Darth Sidious, her grandfather, who had drained the life energy from the young woman. In a moment of tranquility, Rey heard the voices of Ahsoka Tano and the departed Jedi who had come before her. The Jedi spirits gave words of encouragement to Rey, allowing her to muster the strength to rise and ultimately defeat Sidious.\\n\\nLong after the reign of Darth Sidious, when a member of the Whills began recording galactic history for an audience living in a faraway galaxy into the Journal of the Whills, another Whill mentioned Ahsoka Tano as someone to be remembered.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\nAhsoka Tano was a Togruta female who had blue eyes, dark orange skin, brownish-grey lips, white facial markings, a slender build, and white lekku and montrals with blue stripes.

Following her master's death, Tano reflected on the impact of Anakin's decisions on the galaxy. Despite his flaws, she remembered him as \\\"the best of us,\\\" a good man who fell victim to his own fears, and had favorable things to say about him. In 9 ABY, she refused to train the youngling Grogu because she recognized that the child's attachment to his father figure Din Djarin made him vulnerable to the same fears as Anakin. Tano could not bring herself to separate the infant from Djarin, vowing to not set him down the same self-destructive path as her old friend. However, she relented and told Djarin of Tython, a place where Grogu could reach out with the Force to contact other Jedi if he chose to.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, given her close relation to the Skywalker family, Tano met Anakin Skywalker's son Luke Skywalker at some point. In fact, when asked how she knew of his temple, she only answered that she was an old friend to the Skywalker family. Tano and Skywalker were on good terms. She even advised him in the training of Grogu, such as telling the young Skywalker to trust his instincts, and accepted his decision to train the youngling despite her own lack of desire to do so. \", \"\\nNot long after, Tano was dispatched to Mandalore on an undercover mission to uproot corruption scandals in the Mandalorian government and also to help educate Mandalore's youth, including the Duchess's nephew Korkie Kryze and his friends Amis, Lagos, and Soniee, on the basics of lawful and public-serving conduct. After being tasked with the job by Master Yoda, who believed a youthful Padawan could help get through to Mandalore, she was brought to Mandalore by Skywalker. Upon meeting the Duchess as well as Prime Minister Almec, she had to surrender her lightsaber due to restrictions on offworlders carrying weapons. A group of students led by Kryze, with her lessons in mind, proceeded to fight a black market conspiracy. They brought their findings to Tano, who urged them to be more careful. Kryze told her that he only wanted to help his planet like his aunt the Duchess did, but Tano cautioned him from getting into a problem that he could not fix on his own.\\n\\nWhen the cadets were arrested by the Mandalorian secret service on their way to meet with Alemc, Tano stepped in to save them.

The smuggler then told his temporary employer to meet him in Docking Bay 94 for departure as soon as he was ready, before warning Kenobi that some Imperial sandtroopers had entered the cantina and were looking for Evazan and Baba's attacker.

The jetpack ignited, causing the bounty hunter to crash against the side of Jabba's sail barge, the Khetanna, before falling into the pit of a \\\"man-eating\\\" sarlacc.\\n\\nAlthough Boba Fett was rumored to have died, he managed to escape from the sarlacc by burning it from the inside with his armor's flamethrower. A group of Jawas found Boba after he dug his way back to the surface. The scavengers removed Boba's armor while he was injured and unconscious, and left him in the desert where he was discovered by Tusken Raiders. Though initially treated as a prisoner, Boba gradually gained the trust of his captors' chieftain after saving the life of a youngling.\\n\\nOver time he learned to communicate in Tusken, as well as how to fight with a gaderffii stick. \", \"During the Galactic Civil War between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Vader hired Boba as well as several mercenaries to hunt down a Rebel ship, the Millennium Falcon, that escaped from Imperial forces during the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY. The ship's pilot, Captain Han Solo, was a smuggler whom Boba encountered during a meeting with Jabba on Tatooine, shortly before the Battle of Yavin. At the time Vader was determined to capture Luke Skywalker, his secret son who aspired to become a Jedi Knight. Aware of Skywalker's friendship with the occupants of the Millennium Falcon, the Sith Lord intended to use them to lure Skywalker out of hiding. Vader therefore informed the bounty hunters that the Rebels they would hunt were to be captured instead of killed, and specifically warned Boba to not disintegrate his targets.\\n\\nBoba successfully tracked the Millennium Falcon to the Bespin system, where Solo and his companions sought refuge in Cloud City. As a reward for his role in the capture of Skywalker's friends, Boba was allowed to take Solo to Jabba in order to claim the Hutt's bounty on the smuggler. Although Princess Leia Organa attempted to rescue Solo, who was frozen in carbonite, she was unable to prevent Boba's departure from Bespin.\\n\\nBoba transported Solo to Tatooine, where he collected the carbon-frozen smuggler's bounty from Jabba, and resumed his place at the Hutt gangster's side as one of Jabba's most trusted enforcers. \", \"Later, when Jabba's Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II translator droid mistranlated during a deal being made between the Hutt and the Black Sun crime syndicate, causing Jabba to pay double what he should have, Mon informed the crime lord of the mistranslation and its effect. This resulted in the droid being sent to the palace's droid assessement room for punishment.\\n\\nWhen Solo's ally Princess Leia Organa of the Alliance to Restore the Republic began planning an operation to rescue him, she requested dossiers on various members of the Hutt's court from Alliance Intelligence. The largest of these dossiers covered Mon, and consisted of 22 partial bios. Communications concerning this dossier were later included in the compilation of documents known as The Rebel Files.\\n\\nIn 4 ABY, Organa enacted her plan and entered Jabba's Palace at night disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh. Mon was having a festive time and moving up a staircase from the palace's lower levels toward Jabba's throne room while Organa negotiated with Jabba over the size of the bounty for the Wookiee Chewbacca, another ally of Solo's whom she had brought to earn the Hutt's trust.\\n\\nJabba allowed Organa into his court, but, having been tipped off by Fett that Boushh was not who they seemed, the Hutt had Mon and other members of his court hide within the throne room and lie in wait for Organa to free Solo after she believed they had all gone to sleep that night. \", \"Mon then successfully conducted the arms deal and planned to take over the Arms Emporium and rebrand it in his name, considering \\\"Chevin Armorers\\\" as one potential option. He continue to use the logbook to record inventory before a Swokes Swokes lieutenant working for him accidentally left it in a weapons crate that was purchased by Cikatro Vizago of the Broken Horn Syndicate. Vizago read Mon's entries and realized that he had been overcharged by 25 percent for what he had purchased, but wrote that there was nothing he could do about it.\\n\\nEphant Mon came to owe his life to the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure after the Hutt saved him. Because of this, the former gun runner became Jabba's only true friend and due to their friendship, Mon eventually became the head of security at the Hutt's palace on Tatooine. A member of the Hutt's close circle of comrades, and a dark guest to many of the gatherings at the palace during the Imperial Era, he could often be found flanked by several of Jabba's Gamorrean bodyguards.\\n\\nMon at one point allowed an individual who was in Jabba's good graces to use the Hutt's spy network on Tatooine.\\n\\nAfter the smuggler Han Solo was frozen in carbonite in 3 ABY, the bounty hunter Boba Fett set out to deliver the body to Jabba, who had set a bounty on the smuggler's head. \", \"The rest of Jango's clones formed the backbone of the Galactic Republic's new military, and the conflict that engulfed the galaxy\\u2014the Clone Wars\\u2014was named after them. Although they were loyal to the Republic and the Jedi Generals who served alongside them, the clones were programmed to comply with Order 66, a secret directive to exterminate the members of the Jedi Order. With the fall of the Jedi and the support of the clone army, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious claimed the title of Galactic Emperor, reorganizing the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\\n\\nWhile the clones were supplanted by natural-born stormtroopers, Boba became a renowned bounty hunter whose clients included the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure and the Sith Lord Darth Vader. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel smuggler Han Solo inadvertently caused Boba to fall into the Great Pit of Carkoon. Although Boba survived the sarlacc that devoured him, his armor fell into the possession of Jawa scavengers who later sold it to Cobb Vanth. The armor was taken from Vanth by the Mandalorian warrior Din Djarin, leading to a confrontation on Tython with Boba who sought to regain his father's armor. Djarin acknowledged Boba's claim on the armor, although Bo-Katan Kryze denounced Boba as a clone rather than a Mandalorian or a true son of Jango. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.847768882528859, "reason": "The actual output aligns with the expected output in terms of facts and includes citations, but it uses slightly redundant language and adds unnecessary detail with '[1][2]'.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "local model", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "______________________\n| TaskNode | Level == 0 |\n*******************************\nLabel: None\n\nInstructions:\nExtract the citation annotation of format [#] or [#, #] used in the answer `actual_output`, if not ciation is present return null\n\ncitation annotation:\n[1][2]\n \n \n__________________________________\n| BinaryJudgementNode | Level == 1 |\n************************************************\nLabel: None\n\nCriteria:\ntest whether `citation annotation` is present in the format [#] or [#. #] and not null\n\nVerdict: True\nReason: The citation annotation is present in the format [#] and is not null.\n \n \n________________________\n| VerdictNode | Level == 2 |\n**********************************\nVerdict: True\nType: GEval\n\nCriteria:\nNone\nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check whether the facts in 'actual output' contradicts any facts in 'expected output'\",\n    \"You should heavily penalize when 'actual output' is missin a citation of the format [#]\",\n    \"You should also moderately penalize omission of detail\",\n    \"Vague language, or contradicting OPINIONS, are not OK\",\n    \"do not check, comment, or penalize whether 'expected output' has citations\"\n]"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "local model", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}]}, "{\"actual_output\": \"Luke Skywalker died after confronting Kylo Ren because the effort of maintaining the Force projection that distracted Ren proved fatal.

Having failed to take Rey as his new vessel, Sidious resolved to destroy them both, but in the process he discovered that their bond was as powerful as life itself. Realizing that they were a Force dyad, Sidious decided to remain in his clone body and have it healed instead by nearly draining their combined life force in order to do so. Yet his triumphant return was short-lived; calling on the spirits of all the past Jedi, Rey was able to vanquish her grandfather at the cost of her life.

Her confidence was further bolstered by the Force vision she experienced during their last connection, explaining that when they touched hands she saw a future where Ren no longer bowed before Snoke. However, Ren also had a vision of his own, one where he saw Rey standing by his side.\\n\\nRey's confrontation with Snoke led to her brutal interrogation by way of the Supreme Leader's Force powers, and as a result the location of Luke Skywalker's hermitage was successfully probed from her mind. Snoke, who intended to kill the last Jedi after dealing with the more immediate threat of the Resistance, held Rey in stasis and commanded Ren to kill her, exclaiming that this act would be the fulfillment of his dark destiny. Ren's emotions were even further churned up by the bond between himself and Rey, but his newfound resolve and clarity reassured Snoke that his oft-conflicted apprentice would not give into sentiment again. In the end, Snoke's visions and Force senses failed him for he did not see his end at the hands of his own disciple. Through guile and subterfuge, Ren cleaved Snoke in half with Rey's lightsaber, ending his master's life in an act worthy of the Sith Rule of Two.\\n\\n\", \"At this point, they discovered their ability to see, hear and touch each other through the Force. The bond allowed Rey to gain new insights into Ren, who no longer attempted to hide his pain and misery from her. Convinced that the light side still existed within the former Ben Solo, Rey chose to confront Ren in person, believing she could help him turn away from the dark side of the Force.\\n\\nRen's master, Supreme Leader Snoke, was aware of his apprentice's connection to a certain entity in the light, knowing that Ren's growing strength with the dark side meant that his equal would rise in the light. He assumed it would be Luke Skywalker, Ren's previous mentor, until he discovered Rey after her awakening in the Force. Snoke gloated in his success at having gathered Rey and Ren before him, for it proved beyond a doubt that there existed a unique bond between them. Using Snoke's reliance on sensing his every thought, Ren outmaneuvered his mentor and ultimately killed him. With Snoke's unexpected death, the Elite Praetorian Guards did all they could to stop their leader's assassin, causing Ren and Rey to fight alongside each other. Their bond grew even more powerful in combat, amplifying the powers of the two.\\n\\n\", \"By then, Rey felt Organa pass into the Force and realized that she had tried to kill her mentor's son in an act of rage. Regretting her actions, Rey used the Force to repair the damage she had inflicted on Ren, healing his injuries as well as the facial scar that she had given him in their first duel. Ren, who was plagued by self-doubt throughout his life, wondered if the Palpatine bloodline was stronger than the Skywalker bloodline, given that Rey had struck down Ren while he was distracted by his mother's death. However, she had also saved his life by transferring some of her Force energy to Ren, which, in turn, rendered her vulnerable. Her actions confounded Ren, and he sought to make sense of Rey's compassion for him.\\n\\nRen also thought about his grandfather, Vader, whom he had admired but had never been able to contact. As he dwelled on the emptiness of his existence, Ren experienced a vision of his dead father, his last memory of Han Solo brought to life through the Force. Ultimately, his connection with Rey, his parents' forgiveness, and the light within him caused Ben Solo to return to the light side of the Force, destroying the persona of Kylo Ren.\\n\\nRey felt as though she had, by attacking Ren in anger, betrayed the Jedi teachings and personally failed as Organa's apprentice. She returned to Ahch-To as a result, following Luke's example of self-exile. \", \"Following her short and unconventional training under Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, Rey left the planet Ahch-To intent on confronting Ren in person. The bond between them in the Force had shown Rey that there was still light within the former Ben Solo, leading her to believe that the dark warrior was in fact the key to defeating the First Order.\\n\\nFinn and Tico also made it to the dreadnought with DJ's assistance. However, they were caught and apprehended by Captain Phasma's stormtroopers, leading the slicer to betray his allies in order to save himself. Dameron, whose conflict with Holdo came to a head, staged a mutiny and took control of Raddus. Although he secured control of the bridge, Organa regained consciousness and subdued the Resistance pilot, thus ending the insurrection.\\n\\nBy then, Kylo Ren had taken Rey directly to his dark side master, Snoke, who tortured and interrogated Rey in order to learn the location of Skywalker's hermitage. Having gained the knowledge he sought, Snoke ordered Ren to execute Rey, but Ren instead saved her by killing his master. They stood together as allies against the late Snoke's Elite Praetorian Guards, all of whom fell in battle against both the Jedi and Master of the Knights of Ren. When Rey beseeched Ren to call off the First Order's attack on the Resistance, Ren revealed he had no intention of saving his mother's insurgents and invited Rey to rule the galaxy at his side. \", \"Rey's progress only reminded Luke of the potential that he saw in Ben; as Luke retreated deeper into his isolation, Rey turned to Ren through their bond. Luke tried unsuccessfully to dissuade Rey from confronting Ben, but the scavenger believed that she could guide him back to the light as Luke did for Anakin. Once again Luke considered destroying the sacred Jedi texts, burning away the last relics of the ancient Jedi religion, but the spirit of Yoda convinced him to let go of his guilt over Ben's fate and that he had to pass on the lesson of failing to Rey.\\n\\nHis sense of purpose renewed, Luke used his powers to create a Force projection of himself on Crait where the remnants of the Resistance took shelter from the First Order Army, now controlled by Ren who had claimed the mantle of Supreme Leader by assassinating his master. Luke and Organa had a brief reunion while the First Order stood poised to end the Battle of Crait with the Resistance's destruction. Luke then confronted his nephew; he acknowledged to his sister that he could not bring Ben back from the dark side, but he apologized to his former Padawan for failing as a Jedi Master nonetheless. Luke's illusion bought the Resistance time to escape from the First Order, but the effort of maintaining the illusion that distracted Ren proved fatal. Having fulfilled his last goal in life, Luke died peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force.\\n\\n\", \"\\nDespite the sympathy that Rey developed for Ren as a result of their connection and her long isolation, she chose to withdraw from their budding relationship, due to being unable to support Ren's actions against the Resistance and his machinations to rule the galaxy. Before his death, Snoke knew that Rey and Ren were the prophesied dyad in the Force. As the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, Ren vowed to destroy Rey for rejecting him after he entreated her to rule the galaxy by his side, but later confessed that he had no desire to hurt her. During the final days of the conflict, Ren was able to use their connection as a means of tracking Rey's location, first on Pasaana and later aboard his own flagship, the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast. Having discovered that they formed a Force dyad, Ren shared this information with Rey as well as the fact that it remained unknown to Darth Sidious at the time.\\n\\nWith their combined power as a dyad, Ren believed that together they could destroy Sidious and claim the Throne of the Sith, a proposition which Rey denied. Though stung by her rejection, Ren continued to pursue Rey at Sidious' behest, leading to their final confrontation on Kef Bir. As they fought on the wreckage of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, Ren's mother, General Leia Organa, died reaching out to her son in the Force. \", \"\\nDisdaining the memory of Anakin Skywalker, Ren considered Darth Vader the true persona of his legendary grandfather. He was also convinced that he was no longer Ben Solo, and insisted that his former self was dead. The light side of the Force remained within him, however, creating an inner conflict that unbalanced the dark side warrior. Ren struggled to overcome the light's influence through Snoke's training; while the anger he felt towards his uncle fueled his desire to kill Luke, Ren found himself unwilling to harm his parents. During a trial in the Cave of Evil on Dagobah, he was confronted by the apparitions of his mother and father who implored their son to return to them. Ren lashed out at Snoke's urging, succumbing to his rage yet the vision of his parents remained intact; he did not cut them down, and his connection to the light remained.\\n\\nDuring the final days of the Cold War, Kylo Ren spearheaded the hunt for Lor San Tekka as part of his overall mission to find and kill Luke, the last Jedi. His stormtroopers captured the old traveler while raiding a village on the desert planet of Jakku. Rather than cooperate with the fallen Jedi, whom he once knew when Ben Solo was Luke's apprentice, San Tekka reminded Ren of his origins and how he was unable to escape it. He was then executed by the dark side warrior, who ordered Captain Phasma's troops to kill all of the remaining villagers.\\n\\n\", \"\\nWith the death of their Supreme Leader, the Elite Praetorian Guard encircled and engaged the two Force-sensitives, attempting to avenge their slain master. Kylo Ren and Rey drew their lightsabers and stood together as allies against the crimson armored sentinels. Despite the Guard's efforts, all eight were killed in battle. But while Ren had indeed turned against Snoke, killing the Supreme Leader in order to save Rey, the now former apprentice had no intention of turning from the darkness. As Rey beseeched him to call off the First Order's attack on the remaining Resistance transports, Ren saw a chance to fulfill what he believed was his birthright: ruling over the weaker beings of the galaxy.\\n\\nOnce more, Rey implored him to resist the temptations of the dark side, hoping to reach the side of Kylo Ren that was still Ben Solo. Believing that Rey was still clinging to the past, Ren revealed to her the full truth of the vision he saw when they touched hands, that Rey was in fact the daughter of insignificant junk dealers who sold her into child labor before dying in the desert of Jakku.

As such, it was 34.1 meters long. Equipped with a Class 3 hyperdrive, its maximum speed was otherwise 700 kph. It could be manned by a minimum of two crew members: a pilot and co-pilot. The Twilight was armed with two laser cannons: a front-facing one mounted on the foldable fin that extended below the ship in flight, and a rotating one mounted on the fin that stuck out of the right side of the ship. They could be controlled by a pull-down reticle from inside the cockpit.\\n\\nThe Twilight had a roomy cockpit with chairs for the pilots and a navigator, as well as an astromech droid socket.

Sometime after the battle, Rey traveled to the Lars moisture farm on Tatooine with BB-8, where she buried Leia's lightsaber and the Skywalker lightsaber, using her own newly-crafted one in their place. When a local asked for her name, she forwent Palpatine's lineage, going by the name \\\"Rey Skywalker\\\" with the blessing of the Force spirits of Luke and Leia.

While single vaporators often cost 500 credits each, some individuals bought and owned multiple units, creating moisture farms.

In addition, vaporators required frequent maintenance and security systems to deter attacks from Tusken Raiders, who believed all water was sacred and belonged to them.\\n\\nTatooine had only a few port cities, including Mos Espa and Mos Eisley. Beside those cities, which attracted many criminals, most settlers of Tatooine operated moisture farms in the expanse of the desert. Due to the planet's dangerously high daytime temperature and whipping sandstorms, most residents of Tatooine kept their skin covered with practical materials that wick away sweat and limit exposure to the harmful ultraviolet radiation of the twin suns.\\n\\nThe economy of Tatooine largely ran on water and crime. With the Hutt Clan taking near-full control over the trafficking and smuggling trades, new citizens had a large time breaking into the criminal market even though it was more lucrative than the water market. Slavery, while banned through Republic laws, was readily and blatantly practiced under the twin suns. An entire section of Mos Espa was purposed as a Slave Quarter. \", \"On their way out, Ventress had arrived and eventually located the two and engaged them in battle.

Coming into conflict with both the Hutt Clan and the Pyke Syndicate, the new Daimyo was pulled into a gang war that threatened the future of Tatooine.

At Ryloth and Umbara, Tano flew her own Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor. Later, while fighting in the defense of the planet Cato Neimoidia, she piloted a newer Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor, in what would be her last battle before leaving the Jedi Order.

Tano traveled to the planet of Christophsis, where she presented herself to Skywalker in the midst of a battle against Confederate forces.\\n\\nAfter the battle had concluded, Yoda, himself, arrived on the planet and assigned the duo to the task of finding Rotta, the son of influential Hutt crime lord Jabba, who had been kidnapped as part of a plan arranged by his uncle Ziro to alienate the Hutts and the Jedi and drag the former into war.

Despite her young age, the child proved to be wise, and Tano was upset that Fardi would likely never be able to prove her wisdom to Yoda. Later, while sleeping aboard the CR90 corvette Tantive IV after Organa offered her a chance to join his rebellion, Tano remembered Yoda's advice to her when she was getting her first kyber crystal. Awaking and knowing she should make a new set of lightsabers, she thanked Yoda, even though she knew he could not possibly hear or help her.\\n\\nDuring his exile on Dagobah, Yoda kept an eye on other Jedi throughout the galaxy, including those who ventured into the various Jedi Temples found amongst the stars. Approximately four years before the Battle of Yavin, Yoda spoke to Kanan Jarrus, who had been the Padawan of Depa Billaba and a survivor of Order 66.

As one trooper told Sun they would report the incident, the soldiers were shot down by a mysterious woman who introduced herself as Qi'ra.\\n\\nQi'ra told Sun that she had heard of her work and asked her why the Empire had forbid the study of the Force after the disappearance of the Jedi Order. Sun explained that the Empire needed to install fear in the public and to do so they needed to remove the hope that the Force and Jedi represented, as Emperor Palpatine made the very idea a death sentence.\\n\\nAs the two continued to talk, Qi'ra revealed to Sun that Palpatine was really the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, realizing that her life was taken from her, Sun decided to join Qi'ra on her ship.

When Skywalker's former Padawan Ahsoka Tano confronted Maul instead, the renegade Sith disparagingly mocked his adversary's lack of an official rank, calling her \\\"Lady Tano.\\\" The ancient Jedi droid Huyang later referred to Ahsoka Tano as \\\"Lady Tano\\\" when aiding on her quest to find Grand Admiral Thrawn. The mercenary Baylan Skoll referred to his employer, the witch Morgan Elsbeth, as \\\"Lady Morgan.\\\"\\n\\nDuring the War of the Bounty Hunters, the Galactic Empire's ally, Tagge Corporation, was led by Lady Domina Tagge, while the Crimson Dawn syndicate was led by Lady Qi'ra. Lando Calrissian's yacht was named the Lady Luck.\", \"# Sterling\\n\\nSterling was the nickname of a clone trooper of the 332nd Division within the Galactic Republic's 501st Legion who took part in the Siege of Mandalore in 19 BBY. During the siege, Sterling and his unit traveled to reinforce C-deck in the Undercity of the planet Mandalore's capital city of Sundari, but they were ambushed by renegade Sith Lord Maul. While fighting in the ambush, Sterling was wounded by a blaster hit to the torso, and his unit sustained heavy casualties. Sterling reported to the division's military advisor, Ahsoka Tano, about the ambush and informed her that Advanced Recon Commando Jesse had been taken hostage by Maul.\\n\\n## Biography\\n\\nSterling was a clone of the human male Jango Fett and was born on the world of Kamino. In the final days of the galactic-wide conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems known as the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, Sterling was part of the 332nd Division, which conducted the siege of the planet Mandalore under the leadership of the newly appointed Clone Commander Rex alongside former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who acted as an advisor. Sterling was among the clone troopers who successfully landed at Mandalore's capital city of Sundari, where he also participated in and survived the opening skirmishes against rogue Mandalorian super commandos.\\n\\n\", \"Ahsoka Tano fled into the Outer Rim, intent on hiding from the Empire. Eventually, she found the planet Thabeska, a planet that dealt largely in small-scale water and technology trading, and one with a relatively small and unorganized population located far away from major hyperspace routes. Believing the rural world to be of little interest to the Empire, and a steady stream of newcomers would allow herself to blend into the quiet world, Tano made landing on Thabeska. However, the refugee did not account for the presence of the local Fardi clan, an influential family that either touched or ran most of Thabeska's businesses, including their own smuggling operations, though the family fronted such with several legal businesses. In time, Tano came to hear rumors that some kind of dark lord who was serving the Emperor and hunting Jedi, yet she was unable to confirm such reports.\\n\\nIn order to hide her identity, Tano took on the name \\\"Ashla,\\\" which was also the name of a moon that orbited the scared Jedi world of Tython, another term for the light side of the Force, and the name of a Jedi youngling from the Clone Wars-era. Upon arrival on Thabeska, Tano was greeted by several young girls. They showed her where she could find food and a place to stay, and introduced her to Fardi, who bought Ashla's ship for what she thought was a nearly decent price. \", \"However, after being framed for treason by her former friend Barriss Offee, leading to her trial and near-execution, Tano lost faith in the Order and left, leaving her weapons behind. Late in the war, after joining up with Mandalorian warrior Bo-Katan Kryze and her Nite Owls, Tano received her lightsabers back from her former master Anakin Skywalker upon temporarily rejoining the Republic military to lead forces in the Siege of Mandalore. After winning the Siege and capturing the renegade Sith Lord Maul, Tano and Clone Commander Rex's journey back to Coruscant with their prisoner was disrupted by Darth Sidious' issuance of Order 66, which initiated the Great Jedi Purge. After freeing Maul as a distraction for the attacking clone troopers, Tano ambushed Rex and had his control chip removed. However, Maul's subsequent destruction of the hyperdrive of the Tribunal, the Venator-class Star Destroyer they were traveling on, caused the stricken starship to crash on a moon, with only Tano, Rex and Maul making it off beforehand. Afterwards, Tano abandoned her lightsabers by the graves she and Rex had dug for the clones who died in the crash to fake her death, before she and Rex parted ways to go into hiding.\\n\\nTano spent the next year in hiding on the planet Thabeska, working as a mechanic for the Fardi clan. After fleeing the planet on the first Empire Day, Tano, under the alias \\\"Ashla,\\\" wound up on the remote farming moon Raada. \", \"The following day, after mistaking him for an enemy and attacking him with her white sabers, Ahsoka gained the help of Din Djarin, and she was able to infiltrate the magistrate's sanctuary. Armed with a spear of pure beskar, Elsbeth engaged Tano in combat, and even managed to knock one of her lightsabers into a pond. Tano, left with only her shoto, still gained the upper hand and disarmed Elsbeth, and demanded the whereabouts of Grand Admiral Thrawn. In defeating Elsbeth, Ahsoka ended the magistrate's rule of Calodan, and set free its oppressed villagers, but Elsbeth was later freed from New Republic custody by two hired mercenaries, former Jedi Baylan Skoll and his apprentice, Shin Hati.\\n\\nTano continued to wield her lightsabers as she reunited with Wren and continued her search for Thrawn with Huyang and her Padawan. In that time, Tano used her lightsabers against Elsbeth's HK-87 assassin droids and scout guards, the former Inquisitor Marrok, and Skoll. In the end, Tano and Wren would discover Thrawn and Bridger on the extragalactic planet Peridea, where Tano engaged in a second duel against Skoll and, together with Bridger and Wren, fought Thrawn's Night Troopers in an effort to prevent his escape from Peridea. In that battle, the Night Troopers were slain but risen from the dead by Thrawn's allies, the Nightsisters known as the Great Mothers, which left the Night Troopers able to rise after lightsaber strikes or deflected blaster bolts. \", \"The two would often butt heads, each believing that they knew better than the other. During their first mission together at the Battle of Christophsis, they developed demeaning nicknames for each other; Tano gave her master the diminutive title \\\"Skyguy,\\\" while Skywalker returned the favor with the name \\\"Snips,\\\" referring to Tano's snippy wit. Tano used the nickname Skyguy only because it annoyed Skywalker, although, as the war progressed, these nicknames would remain by changing into more playful terms of friendship. Skywalker also quickly came to respect Tano's bravery and determination, and he recognized that Tano was just as reckless as him.\\n\\nFor all their bickering, the two developed a close relationship during the Clone Wars. Skywalker reassured his Padawan that their meeting was no accident and that it was the will of the Force for her to train under him. Their rapport made it's way onto the battlefield, with the duo competing to see who could destroy the most droids during the Second Battle of Geonosis. The master and apprentice grew increasingly reliant on each other throughout the war, taking turns rescuing each other from Separatist forces and bounty hunters. After situations where she was nearly killed, she found that she could talk to her mentor to come to terms with it. Tano's naive outlook balanced with Skywalker's cynical approach. During her time on Mortis, Tano was killed by the Son and only resurrected after Skywalker pleaded with the Father to help save her. \", \"\\nAt birth, like the other clone troopers, Sterling was implanted by the Kaminoan scientists with a behavioral modification biochip to ensure that the trooper would not resist certain orders. Sterling was equipped with a set of Phase II clone trooper armor, which along with that of other troopers of the 332nd Division of the 501st Legion was decorated to match Tano's Togruta coloration and lekku markings.\", \"\\nSometime later, Sterling's unit was sent with Advanced Recon Commando Clone Lieutenant Jesse to reinforce C-deck in Sundari's Undercity, but they were ambushed by renegade Sith Lord Maul, who brutally cut through the Republic forces. Sterling was wounded by a blaster shot to his chest, though he survived, unlike most of the unit, which sustained heavy casualties. Sterling also witnessed Maul capturing Jesse after he had determined through the use of a Force mind probe that the clone was older than the rest of his unit.\\n\\nShortly after, Ahsoka Tano was informed of Maul's attack and quickly made her way to the site of the skirmish alongside Commander Rex. Upon seeing her, Sterling, who was supported by a fellow clone and was sitting against a wall in pain from his injuries, summoned Tano to him, respectfully addressing her as \\\"Commander\\\" despite her lack of military rank. He explained to her what had occurred, recounting Maul's ferocity, and he reached out and grabbed her arm as he emphasized that Maul had taken Jesse captive.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\nAs with the other clones of Jango Fett, Sterling stood 1.83 meters tall  and weighed eighty kilograms. He had brown eyes, tan skin, and sported a short black haircut. Sterling addressed Ahsoka Tano with her former military rank, befitting her status as a former Jedi and leader of the clones. Sterling insisted that Tano needed to know what happened when Maul attacked.\\n\\n## Equipment\\n\\n\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.852885069714931, "reason": "The actual output aligns with the expected output in terms of facts and opinions, includes citations in the correct format, and provides sufficient detail without being vague or contradictory.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "local model", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "______________________\n| TaskNode | Level == 0 |\n*******************************\nLabel: None\n\nInstructions:\nExtract the citation annotation of format [#] or [#, #] used in the answer `actual_output`, if not ciation is present return null\n\ncitation annotation:\n[1][2]\n \n \n__________________________________\n| BinaryJudgementNode | Level == 1 |\n************************************************\nLabel: None\n\nCriteria:\ntest whether `citation annotation` is present in the format [#] or [#. #] and not null\n\nVerdict: True\nReason: The citation annotation is present in the format [#] and is not null, as evidenced by [1][2].\n \n \n________________________\n| VerdictNode | Level == 2 |\n**********************************\nVerdict: True\nType: GEval\n\nCriteria:\nNone\nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check whether the facts in 'actual output' contradicts any facts in 'expected output'\",\n    \"You should heavily penalize when 'actual output' is missin a citation of the format [#]\",\n    \"You should also moderately penalize omission of detail\",\n    \"Vague language, or contradicting OPINIONS, are not OK\",\n    \"do not check, comment, or penalize whether 'expected output' has citations\"\n]"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "local model", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}]}, "{\"actual_output\": \"The Millennium Falcon is a YT-1300 light freighter [1].\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": \"The Millennium Falcon is a Corellian YT-1300 light freighter\", \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"What type of star ship is the Milenium Facon\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"# Commuter ship\\n\\nA commuter ship was a type of starship used for commercial travel between planets.

Upon the orders of Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic, a Star Destroyer fired two beams that disappeared into the black holes known as the Hero Twins.

Tano took the gift and later passed it on to Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, who presented the armor as part of a choice to Grogu. Grogu would then decide whether or not to choose the armor and giving in to the attachment, or the lightsaber of Yoda and the path of a Jedi.

For the mission, he was joined by Kryze, whose forces had abandoned her when she failed to secure the Darksaber. Kryze dove into the waters after Djarin fell in, where she discovered a surviving Mythosaur and, by virtue of entering the waters and then not removing her helmet in the presence of others afterward, was, too, redeemed in the eyes of the Tribe.

In addition, they were designed to grow at twice the rate of normal human aging, making the clone troopers ready for deployment in a decade's time. At Fett's request, an unmodified clone\\u2014Boba Fett\\u2014was created from his template and given to him to raise as his son.\\n\\nDuring the Clone Wars, Fett's clone soldiers served in the Grand Army of the Republic under Jedi leadership until Order 66 called for the destruction of the Jedi Order. The clones carried out their mandate due to their programming, eliminating most of the Jedi Knights across the galaxy, after which the Galactic Empire was formed by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Shortly thereafter, the entire clone army was decommissioned and replaced by birth-born stormtroopers.\\n\\nThe Empire ultimately fell to the New Republic after the Emperor's destruction. However, Sidious managed to cheat death. Through the combined use of cloning and the dark side of the Force, the Sith Lord transferred his spirit to a new host that had been cloned from his original body. \", \"Around ten years prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas ordered the clone army for the Republic, having had visions of a future conflict. However, the Sith took over the project as part of their plot to destroy the Jedi Order, having Sifo-Dyas murdered by the Pyke Syndicate and concealing the true circumstances and location of his death from the Jedi. Count Dooku, posing as a Jedi to the Kaminoan cloners, provided the Kaminoans with a bio-chip to be implanted into the clones during the early phase of their growth period. This chip contained the order the Kaminoans knew as \\\"Clone Protocol 66\\\"\\u2014which, when activated, would ensure total obedience in the clones and cause them to violently lash out against the Jedi.\\n\\nThe Kaminoans, including Prime Minister Lama Su and Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se, believed the protocol existed as a contingency for rogue Jedi. Dooku, who was only known to the cloners under the alias of his Sith name, also convinced them that it was imperative the existence of the protocol and chips be kept secret from the Jedi, claiming it was what Sifo-Dyas had wanted. The clone army's existence became known to the Jedi just before the Clone Wars when Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi tracked clone template Jango Fett to Kamino while investigating an assassination attempt on Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala.\\n\\n\", \"As a result, the new clones were less efficient according to Lama Su, who recommended to Jedi Master Shaak Ti that the Order should procure another template due to their waning supply of Fett DNA. As the Clone Wars continued to spread across the galaxy, the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded Kamino with the aim of halting the world's cloning production. The Republic Military successfully defended Tipoca City from the Separatist Droid Army while Jedi General Anakin Skywalker prevented Asajj Ventress from stealing the last supply of Fett's genetic samples.\\n\\nShortly after the discovery of the Zillo Beast on Malastare, the Republic Military transferred the creature to the Republic capital for scientific study. In the aftermath of the beast's escape and subsequent death, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine ordered Doctor Sionver Boll to utilize its corpse as a clone template. The Empire's Advanced Science Division later succeeded in utilizing this prime clone to create a line of zillo beast clones which were kept in the Tantiss Base on Wayland.\\n\\nA premature execution of Order 66 led CT-5555 \\\"Fives,\\\" an Advanced Recon Commando with the 501st Legion, to investigate the cause of Jedi General Tiplar's death at the hands of CT-5385 \\\"Tup.\\\" Aided by the medical droid AZI-345211896246498721347, Fives learned that the \\\"tumor\\\" in Tup's brain was not part of the original Jango Fett genome; it was in fact an artificial construct that had been implanted in every clone during the initial phase of their development. \", \"Following the death of Sifo-Dyas, the Sith took control of his project and hired a human bounty hunter, Jango Fett, to serve as the army's clone template. Fett's genetic code served the foundation for millions of clone troopers who all shared the same face, voice, and combat prowess as their progenitor, although they were also structurally modified at the genetic level to make them less independent and more docile. The first clones of the Jango Fett genotype were designated as \\\"generation one,\\\" and among their ranks was Clone Captain CT-7567 of the 501st Legion.\\n\\nFurther genetic tampering caused Fett's clones to grow at twice the rate of the human species, making them ready for deployment in a decade's time. While the process of growing clone troopers was left to Kaminoan scientists, the Sith took a more active role in their programming, having supplied their cloners with behavioral modification biochips to be implanted in the brain of every clone at the earliest stage of their development. Portrayed as a structural inhibitor chip, they ostensibly made their hosts more docile and less aggressive than their template, but their true purpose was to force the clones to obey Order 66\\u2014a secret protocol authorizing the immediate extermination of the Jedi Order as enemies of the state.\\n\\nIn addition to Fett's considerable monetary fee, the Kaminoans compensated him by creating a clone\\u2014codenamed Alpha\\u2014that stood apart from the rest of his artificial progeny. \", \"Palpatine used the duel as a pretext to declare that the Jedi were traitors, ones who had attempted to assassinate him and take control of the Republic for themselves. The Chancellor issued Order 66 to various clone officers across the galaxy, while Skywalker\\u2014now the Sith Lord Darth Vader\\u2014was sent to kill the Jedi within the Jedi Temple, thus launching an unprecedented and galaxy-wide massacre. Thousands of Jedi throughout the galaxy were killed, including Ki-Adi-Mundi on Mygeeto, Aayla Secura on Felucia, Plo Koon in the skies of Cato Neimoidia, Stass Allie on Saleucami, Depa Billaba on Kaller, Jaro Tapal in the Bracca system, and even Jedi younglings. As part of the execution of Order 66, the elements of the 481st Legion were sent to the planet Ilum to secure the Jedi Temple there and kill any survivors.\\n\\nSome officers, such as Clone Marshal Commander Cody, received individual transmissions from Palpatine. Afterwards, the order was broadcast on repeat through the Grand Army's communications channels to ensure that all troopers heard it. Throughout the duration of the Empire, Order 66 was still active: all known or merely suspected Jedi were to be shot on sight.\\n\\nAside from Anakin Skywalker, some Jedi were protected from the massacre invoked by Order 66, but under other circumstances. Some Jedi within the Jedi Temple on Coruscant were watched and influenced by spies placed inside the temple by Darth Sidious himself. \", \"Through the combined use of cloning and the dark side of the Force, the Sith Lord transferred his spirit to a new host that had been cloned from his original body. Though the transference had been a success, Sidious' new vessel suffered from rapid deterioration and was unable to contain the dark energy of his soul. His followers, the Sith Eternal, experimented with Sidious' template in the hope of creating a more suitable vessel. Their efforts produced various Strand-Casts, including Supreme Leader Snoke and multiple genetic copies of him, as well as a modified clone that was healthy yet lacked Sidious' connection to the Force. As such, the clone's only worth to Sidious lay in continuing the Palpatine bloodline through more natural means, resulting in the birth of Rey who, unlike her father, was regarded as the ideal host for her grandfather's essence following Ben Solo's rejection of the dark side.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nCloning was the scientific procedure of growing a clone from the genetic template of a living organism. The template's DNA was the foundation for clones, which could number from at least one genetic copy to millions of specimens that shared the same face, voice, and even skills inherited from the original source. The template's genetic code could be altered through modifications to the cloning process for various purposes, including growth acceleration and greater docility. Without alterations to the genome, a clone would be the exact duplicate of its template at the genetic level.\\n\\n\", \"\\nIn spite of Taun We's confidence in the clone army's training, Fett was indifferent to them, referring to his cloned progeny as \\\"livestock\\\" bred to fight and die as \\\"cannon fodder.\\\" He dismissed the Kaminoan aide's assumption that he would be proud of his clones, and reminded Taun We that they were the Kaminoans' creations.\\n\\nDuring the Separatist Crisis, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the clone army on Kamino while investigating an assassination plot against Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. Prime Minister Lama Su and Taun We took him on an inspection tour of the cloning facility in Tipoca City, believing he had been dispatched at the behest of the Jedi High Council and the Galactic Senate. During the tour, Kenobi learned the identity of clone army's template, Jango Fett, who was also the would-be assassin who tried to kill Amidala. Kenobi reported his findings to his superiors, Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu, who ordered him to bring the hunter to the Jedi Grand Temple on Coruscant for interrogation.\\n\\nFollowing the death of Jango Fett in the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, the Kaminoans were forced to conserve their remaining samples of the Fett genome in order to grow more clones for the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic. As a result, the new clones were less efficient according to Lama Su, who recommended to Jedi Master Shaak Ti that the Order should procure another template due to their waning supply of Fett DNA. \", \"\\nLater, the Jedi discovered that the Sith were behind the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic, as Count Dooku\\u2014under the name Tyranus\\u2014had selected Jango Fett as the genetic template for the clones and had worked with the Kaminoans to create the army after it was ordered by Sifo-Dyas. At the insistence of Grand Master Yoda, who testified to the clones' loyalty and valiant service, the Jedi High Council chose not to disclose the conspiracy to the public or even the Supreme Chancellor, believing that the Republic would lose the public's trust if it became known that Dooku was involved in the creation of the clone army. Shortly thereafter, Yoda went on a journey to discover the secrets of immortality, and, on Dagobah, saw a vision of what would become Order 66. Throughout his journey, Yoda came to accept that the Jedi would likely lose the Clone Wars, though he did not know how. He did, however, believe that the Jedi would still triumph in the long run.\\n\\nAfter learning from members of the Grysk species, which was unknown in most of the galaxy, that the metal cortosis was resistant to lightsabers, Dooku and Sidious attempted to acquire supplies of the resource from the planet Mokivj in an operation headed by Duke Solha.

Members of the legislature held the title of Representative.\", \"# Padm\\u00e9 Amidala\\n\\nPadm\\u00e9 Amidala Naberrie was a human female senator who represented the people of Naboo during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Prior to her career in the Galactic Senate, Amidala was the elected ruler of the Royal House of Naboo. A political idealist, she advocated for the preservation of democracy as well as a peaceful resolution to the Clone Wars. However, her secret marriage to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker would have a lasting effect on the future of the galaxy for decades to come.\\n\\nBorn in 46 BBY during the Age of the Republic, Padm\\u00e9 Naberrie was raised by her parents, Ruwee Naberrie and his wife Jobal, on the peaceful Mid Rim world of Naboo. Despite the humble background of the Naberrie family, Padm\\u00e9 was identified early for her potential in public service. Devoting her life to civic duty, she was elected queen and, therefore, adopted the regnal name \\\"Amidala\\\" in 32 BBY. Due to the machinations of her advisor, Senator Sheev Palpatine, Amidala's reign was put to the test by the Trade Federation's blockade and subsequent invasion of Naboo. Unable to fight the Federation's army of battle droids without assistance, the queen beseeched the Galactic Senate on Coruscant for help, only to see her efforts hampered by bureaucracy and procedure. \", \"# Shiraya fan headdress\\n\\nA Shiraya fan headdress was a type of headdress that shared its name with a figure in the Naboo culture named Shiraya.

After Organa was forced to withdraw her candidacy for First Senator of the New Republic when Lady Carise Sindian exposed her as the daughter of Darth Vader and Padm\\u00e9 Amidala, Leia admitted her true parentage in front of the Galactic Senate.\\n\\nThe gowns owned by Amidala were kept on Naboo for many years after her death. Eventually, the gowns found their way to Organa. Because Organa only knew Amidala from the things she owned and the stories told to her by people who had known her, the gowns meant a lot to her, and she stored them in a safe location. However, the gowns were thrown into hyperspace by Terex of the First Order after he stole Organa's ship on Cato Neimoidia.\\n\\nIn 35 ABY, Amidala was remembered for the final time by her daughter as she gave up her life to save her own son, Amidala's grandson, Ben Solo, whom had fallen to the dark side like his grandfather, Amidala's husband Anakin Skywalker. She also reconciled with and saw the good within Skywalker as his spirit appeared to her in her final moments, the good her brother Luke Skywalker had told her of, and the good Amidala believed was still within him on her deathbed.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\nAmidala was compassionate to other people and stood her ground firmly for what she believed in. \", \"Master Jinn promptly accepted the offer, but Amidala criticized his actions; although she did like Skywalker, she thought it was unwise to place the fate of Naboo in the hands of a nine-year-old boy. However, Skywalker managed to win the race, beating the reigning champion Sebulba against all odds, and Amidala joined the scenes of jubilation that followed the boy's victory in the Grand Arena of Mos Espa. Thanks to a bargain Qui-Gon Jinn had made with Watto, Skywalker was freed from slavery and allowed to accompany the Jedi in their travel.

In preparation for her public appearance before the Republic Senate, she met with Senator Palpatine, who represented the Naboo system in that governing body. While she wished to plead for the Senate to rescue her homeworld, Palpatine informed her that the assembly was too corrupt to care about their situation. The senator then encouraged Amidala to move for a Vote of No Confidence in the leadership of Chancellor Valorum. Valorum was a well-meaning politician, and the queen initially refused to move against him. \", \"Symbolically, the attire symbolized Naboo's emergence from darkness. The veils on the cape resembled the petals of certain flowers that grew on the planet Naboo in the hometown of Queen Padm\\u00e9 Amidala.

After Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan and Daln\\u00e9 inspected a mine on Onoam, Organa wished to visit Imperial Moff Quarsh Panaka to discuss the miners' working conditions. Since the only outfit Organa had brought along was dirty, Daln\\u00e9 loaned the jubilation dress to the princess, although Organa declined her offer of an accompanying headdress.

Her answers to questions about her history confirmed his suspicion that she was indeed Amidala's daughter. Panaka intended to inform Emperor Palpatine of his discovery, but was assassinated by the Partisans in an explosion just after his meeting with Organa. Organa was injured and the jubilation dress was dirtied when the blast threw her.\\n\\nOrgana returned home still wearing the dress, where her attendant droid WA-2V fell in love with it. The princess was annoyed, while the droid claimed that the jubilation dress was the most beautiful thing Organa had ever worn. WA-2V was disappointed that the dress had to be returned to Daln\\u00e9, but cheered herself up by noting that they at least had \\\"a wonderful example to draw from\\\" for the princess' wardrobe. Leia cared very little about the dress, however, and simply asked WA-2V where her parents were.\\n\\nA mural depicting Amidala wearing the dress during the parade celebrating the liberation of Naboo was eventually made as a tribute to the alliance Amidala formed in the wake of the Trade Federation's invasion. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.798601705599373, "reason": "The actual output includes a citation [5], which is a positive aspect, but it adds 'of the Royal House' which is an unnecessary detail not present in the expected output.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "local model", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "______________________\n| TaskNode | Level == 0 |\n*******************************\nLabel: None\n\nInstructions:\nExtract the citation annotation of format [#] or [#, #] used in the answer `actual_output`, if not ciation is present return null\n\ncitation annotation:\n[5]\n \n \n__________________________________\n| BinaryJudgementNode | Level == 1 |\n************************************************\nLabel: None\n\nCriteria:\ntest whether `citation annotation` is present in the format [#] or [#. #] and not null\n\nVerdict: True\nReason: The citation annotation is present in the format [#] and is not null.\n \n \n________________________\n| VerdictNode | Level == 2 |\n**********************************\nVerdict: True\nType: GEval\n\nCriteria:\nNone\nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check whether the facts in 'actual output' contradicts any facts in 'expected output'\",\n    \"You should heavily penalize when 'actual output' is missin a citation of the format [#]\",\n    \"You should also moderately penalize omission of detail\",\n    \"Vague language, or contradicting OPINIONS, are not OK\",\n    \"do not check, comment, or penalize whether 'expected output' has citations\"\n]"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "local model", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}]}, "{\"actual_output\": \"Darth Maul, originally named Maul, was a Sith apprentice trained by Darth Sidious.

The Dark Lords ruled the galaxy for a generation until the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, when Sidious betrayed Vader and tried to make Luke Skywalker his new apprentice.

While Maul actually managed to survive, Sidious moved on by naming Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master who secretly had already been working with the Sith, as his second apprentice, Darth Tyranus. \", \"Utilizing the knowledge that he acquired from his late Master, Darth Plagueis, Sidious succeeded in moving his consciousness to a clone of his original body, through a dark-side technique known as Transference. In his new host form, Sidious endeavored to achieve the restoration of Sith rule across the galaxy.\\n\\nAfter Luke Skywalker's death, Sidious revealed his survival to the public through a galaxy-wide broadcast, leading to the search for Exegol by Supreme Leader Kylo Ren and the Jedi apprentice Rey\\u2014the respective descendants of Darth Vader and Darth Sidious. Although the First Order and the Resistance referred to the Emperor by his family name, Palpatine, this time Sidious made no effort to conceal his Sith identity, declaring that the Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order, would usher in the rise of a new Sith Empire.\\n\\nThe Darth Malted Milkshake was a drink sold in the galaxy. Darth Krist-Ov was a character in a tragic play performed during the Clone Wars. Darth Vader's name was remembered and hated for years after his death. During the First Order-Resistance War, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker mentioned his father and Sidious by their Sith names while recounting their history to the scavenger Rey.\", \"While Maul actually managed to survive, Sidious moved on by naming Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master who secretly had already been working with the Sith, as his second apprentice, Darth Tyranus. Despite the Rule of Two, Dooku would go onto take an apprentice of his own, the Nightsister and former Jedi Padawan Asajj Ventress, who he trained in the ways of the dark side.\\n\\nSo long as Ventress remained a mere agent not trained as a Sith Lord, Sidious was unbothered by her existence and even made use of her in his own plans. Formally, she was simply a Sith acolyte and Sith assassin known also as a Dark Acolyte. However, Ventress's ultimate dream was to be seen as a true Sith with the title of Sith Lord. Indeed, Dooku secretly told her they could overthrow Sidious to rule the galaxy themselves and trained her as a Sith apprentice who would help in overthrowing Sidious. As Dooku's disciple, Ventress served him as a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems with ranks such as Supreme Leader and commander during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Dooku's Confederacy, a war that fed into the Sith Order's Grand Plan. During a mission to Cato Neimoidia, she also expressed interest in capturing Jedi Initiate Mill Alibeth, promising her a future under a true master away from the ways of the Jedi. \", \"\\nInstead, a Sith acolyte was\\u2014at least in theory\\u2014only provided with limited training to serve as a lesser agent who could never arise against the true two Sith: rather than act as one of the Sith Lords, a Sith acolyte acted under their command and carried out what the Sith apprentice Darth Tyranus once disparagingly described as \\\"grunt work.\\\" Furthermore, a Sith acolyte could be disposed of once they had outlived their usefulness or had grown too powerful. Due to the deceptive nature of the Sith, however, it was more than possible the Sith apprentice would attempt to train an acolyte to overthrow their master, with plans to take that title for themselves and turn their acolyte into a true Sith apprentice. Tyranus, for example, trained his acolyte Asajj Ventress as a Sith apprentice and told her they would overthrow his own master, the Sith Master Darth Sidious, to rule the galaxy themselves until Sidious sensed Ventress's growing power and ordered her eliminated, to which Dooku reluctantly complied.\\n\\nThe Stranger's Sith acolyte Mae-ho \\\"Mae\\\" Aneiseya\\\" also served as a Sith assassin, as did Ventress. As a member of Tyranus's Confederacy of Independent Systems, Ventress also served as a military leader in addition to her assassin role.

He spoke a fractured, heavily accented form of Basic known as Anzellan.\\n\\n## Biography\\n\\nBabu Frik worked for the Spice Runners of Kijimi on the planet of Kijimi for some time before the Cold War. When Zorii Bliss and Poe Dameron and members of the gang went to Quintil to rescue Tomasso, Bliss asked after Frik. Later, after Bliss and Dameron were inducted as Spice Runners, Bliss brought Dameron and their damaged droid companion EV-6B6 to Babu, who fixed the droid for them. When Dameron abandoned the group to join the New Republic, Babu allowed him to take a holographic disguise matrix so he could sneak offworld. Sometime after the Battle of Crait, Kijimi fell under First Order occupation, which made life more difficult for Babu and the band of spice runners.\\n\\nDuring the war between the First Order and the Resistance, a group of Resistance members consisting of Rey, Finn, Chewbacca, BB-8, C-3PO, and the now Resistance Commander Poe Dameron recovered a Sith dagger.

Sometimes referred to as Threepio, he was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.\\n\\nC-3PO was rebuilt from spare parts by Anakin Skywalker, a human slave who lived in Mos Espa, a city on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. During the Clone Wars, he would serve the Naboo Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. Shortly after the Clone Wars, C-3PO's memory was erased, though R2-D2's memory was not. C-3PO and R2-D2 were assigned to the Alderaan cruiser Tantive IV, where they served senator Bail Organa for nineteen years, assisting in his fledgling resistance movement against the Galactic Empire. At some point during this time, C-3PO's right leg was fitted with mismatched plating.\\n\\nC-3PO remained constant companions with R2, and in 0 BBY, the pair became embroiled in the Galactic Civil War when Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance entrusted them to bring a copy of the Death Star plans to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. \", \"C-3PO was known for his polite, fastidious, and worry-prone personality. As a droid, he exhibited much loyalty and commitment to his masters and sought to serve them to his best ability. Throughout his operational life, C-3PO worked diligently for several masters including Anakin Skywalker, Padm\\u00e9 Amidala, Bail Organa, and Luke Skywalker. As a protocol droid, C-3PO could communicate in over seven million different forms of communication. This allowed him to communicate with computer systems including those on the Millennium Falcon. Pit droid WAC-47 found C-3PO to be a \\\"handsome fella.\\\"\\n\\nUnlike his best friend and astromech counterpart, R2-D2, C-3PO liked to stick to routine and did not respond well to change. When placed in danger, C-3PO had a tendency to panic as shown on several occasions, including infiltrating a droid foundry on Geonosis and a mission to steal Imperial disruptors on Lothal. Despite his loyalty and commitment, C-3PO was generally unable to lie or to keep secrets due to his programming. In fact, after the Hijacking of the Harbinger, during which Task Force 99 captured him, they remarked to Darth Vader that they were unable to get him to shut up. Despite the droid's talkative nature, he was able to keep Anakin and Padm\\u00e9's marriage secret. C-3PO's inability to lie came at a disadvantage when he and his companions were captured by Ewoks prior to the Battle of Endor. \", \"C-3PO's inability to lie came at a disadvantage when he and his companions were captured by Ewoks prior to the Battle of Endor.

On Endor, he found it difficult to impersonate a deity due to his programming, and during the attack on the Resistance fleet, he attempted to leave a mutiny in progress because it was not correct protocol.\\n\\nC-3PO continued serving Leia Organa in her careers as New Republic senator and subsequently Resistance General. C-3PO managed General Organa's Resistance droid spy network. Despite not being able to run or fight, C-3PO bravely stayed behind to hold back the First Order Agent Terex so that Poe Dameron and the spy droid N1-ZX could flee deeper into the caves. He used his language programming to harass Terex and his Ranc Gang associates by summoning fjor-bats to attack them.

Dameron recovered and led Calrissian away, with Organa instructing C-3PO to continue.\\n\\nHowever, C-3PO revealed that he had successfully compiled the Trawak language based on the talky's messages, thus being able to encode further communications without its help. The talky was incredulous, believing no droid could reconstruct Trawak due to its complexity. C-3PO informed the talker droid that he was far more advanced than it and criticized its self-interest before thanking the talky for its service and deactivating it. With the talky powered down and Lobot having survived the ordeal, Organa ordered for the ancient droid to be placed in storage.\\n\\nCalrissian, concluding as a result of the incident that the Rebellion did not care for him or Lobot, decided to sell the talker droid, and thus the key to the rebels' new communications, to the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, to whom he owed a debt. He entered the storage room where the deactivated talky was kept, having incapacitated a rebel trooper inside, and informed Jabba's majordomo, Bib Fortuna, that he would find a way to send the droid to him. \", \"The droid was successfully reactivated; however, it was still malfunctioning, speaking incoherently and rising up from the table it had been lying on. The talker droid threw C-3PO across the room and confronted R2-D2, who attempted to shock it.

Lobot, entering the room to face the talker droid, managed to connect with the droid and reorganize its circuits, removing the corruption from within it.\\n\\nUpon awakening, the talker droid asked who the rebels were. C-3PO spoke with the ancient droid, informing it that it had awoken in the future and requesting that the linguistics droid prepared its Trawak language module for download. The droid refused, to C-3PO's surprise, not wishing to surrender the one reason that it had been brought back online. Interrupting C-3PO's outrage, Calrissian reminded the talker droid that it was functioning solely because of Lobot, who could undo what he had done to fix the droid. Calrissian offered to have Lobot keep the droid online in return for the droid translating for the rebels. Princess Leia Organa informed the droid of the ongoing war, asking that the talker droid encode the Rebellion's communications into Trawak.\\n\\nThe talker droid accepted the rebels' terms, agreeing to work for them as long as Lobot helped it work around the corruption in its processing unit. \", \"Upon the departure of the Resistance fighters, Babu Frik contacted Jannah and the rest of Company 77 on Kef Bir in the hope that they would be able to aid the fighters on their quest to find the Emperor's wayfinder which would lead them to the Sith world of Exegol. While Frik was busy working on a battle droid, Sidious gave the order to use one of his Xyston-class Star Destroyers to destroy Kijimi. While Frik escaped with Bliss, leaving his battle droid behind, the snow-covered planet was obliterated by the Sith Star Destroyer's axial superlaser.\\n\\nAlthough Dameron feared his old friends had been killed, both Babu Frik and Zorii Bliss joined with Lando Calrissian and the Citizens' Fleet. The two flew a BTA-NR2 Y-wing starfighter during the Battle of Exegol against the Sith Eternal forces, including the Final Order.

Aware that the procedure would erase his memory, C-3PO decided to undergo it as he knew there was no other way to have a chance at defeating Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal. The protocol droid later regained his memory from a backup carried by R2-D2. Babu tinkered with C-3PO's main processing unit in order to locate the text of the inscription and override the programming preventing C-3PO from speaking the translation. During the procedure, C-3PO's photoreceptors became red as he spoke the words. After completing the translation C-3PO was rebooted with no memory, leaving him only with his base factory programming.\\n\\nUpon the departure of the Resistance fighters, Babu Frik contacted Jannah and the rest of Company 77 on Kef Bir in the hope that they would be able to aid the fighters on their quest to find the Emperor's wayfinder which would lead them to the Sith world of Exegol. \", \"\\nFollowing the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance split its fleet into divisions, intending for the divisions to communicate with one another in order to reform. However, the Empire was able to crack the rebel encryption codes, and the Rebellion wished to devise a new method of secure communication. Aware of the Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II's existence, C-3PO suggested that the rebels use its knowledge of Trawak as the basis for a new code. In order to do so, the Rebellion planned a mission to steal the droid from the Imperial Museum, dispatching a team of Pathfinders, accompanied by the cyborg Lobot and former Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian.\\n\\nAfter learning of the droid's location within the private collection, the rebels drew the curator out and kept him distracted so that Lobot could slice the door and allow them to break in.

Obi-Wan told Skywalker that he did not remember much about his early life; he only knew that he left his homeworld at a young age, and was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant after being identified as Force-sensitive. Skywalker, having joined the Order at a much later time in his life than other Jedi, drew comparisons between his experience as a Padawan and that of his master, which in turn contributed to his insecurity and self-doubt.\\n\\nObi-Wan only retained vague memories of his biological family.

While on Ahch-To, after Luke Skywalker reconnected to the Force, he felt Kenobi's spirit, along with Yoda, and his father Anakin with him again and felt comfort in that. Sometime after as Skywalker was dying, he thought he heard the familiar voice of Kenobi urging him to let go and he did, joining Kenobi, Yoda, and his father in the Force.\\n\\nThirty years later, Obi-Wan spoke to the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey in the voice of his younger self during a vision she received upon touching the lightsaber that previously belonged to Luke Skywalker, and Anakin before him. Obi-Wan called out to Rey, telling her that these were her first steps, and that the Force would be with her in her fight against the dark side.\\n\\nOne year later in 35 ABY, during the Battle of Exegol, Kenobi's voice was again heard by Rey among the voices of many Jedi of the past who aided her with destroying the resurrected Darth Sidious once and for all. \", \"Ultimately, the rumor was a trap to lure fugitive Jedi to the Grand Inquisitor.

Concerned by Bridger's ability to harness the dark side, Jarrus warned him to not lose control of his emotions.\\n\\nApproximately two decades after the Galactic Empire rose to power, Luke Skywalker embarked on a journey to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him. He was initially trained by Anakin Skywalker's former Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who taught Luke how to sense the Force through his feelings. However, their time together as Master and apprentice was cut short by Kenobi's death at the hands of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, forcing the young Skywalker to continue his Jedi training alone. After communing with the Force spirit of Kenobi, Skywalker traveled to Dagobah, where he discovered Yoda, the ancient Grand Master of the Jedi Order. But Yoda was initially discouraged by Skywalker's attitude, seeing much of Anakin's impatience and anger in Luke. After some consideration and Kenobi's endorsement, Yoda chose to overlook Skywalker's age as well as his penchant for adventure and excitement in order to complete his training.\\n\\nSkywalker and Yoda were often at odds throughout their time together, with the latter trying to teach his apprentice to be calm and in control of his developing Jedi abilities.

Yoda told Skywalker that, while he required no further formal training, he had to confront his father one last time in order to finally become a true Jedi. Skywalker not only passed his final test, but also inspired Vader to turn away from the dark side, destroying the Sith and fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One.\\n\\nWith the Sith defeated, Luke Skywalker wandered the galaxy searching for knowledge that could help restore the Jedi Order. He trained his sister Leia Organa in the ways of the Force until she ceased her training to protect her son, Ben Solo, from the death she had foreseen would come if she continued down that path.

In death, Kenobi became one with the Force which allowed him to continue guiding Luke throughout the Galactic Civil War. In 4 ABY, Kenobi reunited with his former student, Anakin Skywalker, who died destroying his Sith Master in order to save his son. Kenobi was remembered as a legendary Jedi Master during the rise of the New Republic; Ben Solo, the son of Luke's twin sister, Princess Leia Organa, was named after Kenobi. Solo's turn to the dark side left Luke disillusioned with the Jedi Order's legacy, and he held Kenobi responsible for Anakin's transformation into Vader.

Soldiers in the field complained that it attempted to manage the Rebellion as a government, and not a military resistance.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nIn the early days of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire, various rebel cells began coordinating their efforts to combat the reign of the Empire. A Rebel Command was established that included Bail Organa and Commander Jun Sato. In 2 BBY, Organa and Sato tasked the crew of the Ghost with a mission to recover a rebel team led by Saw Gerrera from the planet Geonosis.\\n\\nFollowing the formation of the Rebel Alliance, the Alliance High Command based themselves on Dantooine before they transferred operations to a new headquarters inside the ruins of the Great Temple on Yavin 4. It was from there that the Alliance launched their assault on the planet Scarif and saw the acquisition of the technical data to the Galactic Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star.\\n\\nFollowing the evacuation from Yavin, The Alliance High Command met in the Alliance Fleet to discuss what actions to take next. \", \"# Echo Base\\n\\nEcho Base was the facility established by the Rebel Alliance on the frigid planet of Hoth in the wake of the Battle of Yavin, so named due to its strange acoustics. Within a month of its establishment, the base was discovered by the Galactic Empire, which quickly invaded Hoth, forcing the Rebels to evacuate.\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nThe den of a wampa clan before the arrival of the Rebel Alliance, Echo Base was carved out of a glacier and connected by artificial corridors linked together with structural supports, while natural caverns were expanded to suit the Alliance's needs. It took the Alliance Engineering Corps eighteen months to build, with two full months to install the equipment needed to make the base functional and survivable. It was protected from orbital bombardments by a massive shield generator  and a v-150 ion cannon, which would help the Alliance evacuate the base in case of an attack.\\n\\nOwing to slap-dash construction methods, a single faulty element in the base's electrical system could deny heat to half the base. Nevertheless, soldiers of the outpost were better equipped and displayed better discipline than those stationed elsewhere. In its cavernous ice hangars, the base hosted a contingent of speeders, which were specially modified to operate in the harsh conditions and which the Rebels used for patrol and defense of the outpost. \", \"# Evacuation of Yavin 4\\n\\nThe evacuation of Yavin 4, also known as the evacuation of Base One or the evacuation of the Great Temple, by the Alliance to Restore the Republic took place in 0 ABY, in the days that followed the Battle of Yavin. Having destroyed the Galactic Empire's newest battle station, the Death Star, the Alliance feared reprisal attacks now that their position had been revealed. Therefore, they were forced to abandon the Great Temple on Yavin 4 in order to find a new base of operations. According to the cartographer Emil Graf, the final act of the evacuation involved an attack by an Imperial-class Star Destroyer, which was thwarted by the Alliance pilot Evaan Verlaine.\\n\\n## Prelude\\n\\nNineteen years after Sheev Palpatine's rise to emperorship, on a day that was later marked as the start of a new calendar system, the Rebels of the Alliance to Restore the Republic launched an attack on the Galactic Empire's Death Star battle station from their headquarters at the Great Temple, on the fourth moon of Yavin. They managed to destroy the planet-killing battle station, dealing the Empire a major blow. Although there had been casualties, the Alliance happily celebrated their victory. \", \"# Unidentified wampa's clan\\n\\nA Wampa clan lived on the planet Hoth around three years after the Battle of Yavin. Prior to the Battle of Hoth, the clan lived in what would eventually become the Rebel Alliance's Echo Base.

The morning after the battle, two heroes of the battle, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, were awarded the Medal of Bravery during a ceremony presided by Princess Leia Organa of the Alliance, who was instrumental to the rebellion, and whose homeworld of Alderaan had been destroyed by the Death Star.\\n\\n## Evacuation\\n\\nAs soon as the award ceremony was over, General Jan Dodonna addressed the assembled Rebels, telling them that the base should be evacuated immediately for fear of Imperial retaliation. All rebel fleets arrived in order to assist with the evacuation, and each Rebel was assigned a station for dismantling and transporting, while some were charged with scouting for potential outposts. Solo and Chewbacca also prepared to depart from the rebels, but they ultimately agreed to carry out the Cyrkon Extraction at Organa's request.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Dodonna began working to find a planet or moon to serve as a new secret base of operations. Against the general's order, Princess Leia Organa left the base under the cover of darkness with a compatriot and fellow Alderaanian, Evaan Verlaine of the Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps. Together, they undertook an unsanctioned mission to rescue their fellow Alderaanians who had survived the destruction of their home planet.

Though the Death Star was destroyed, the Rebels evacuated the Great Temple as the Empire still knew where the Alliance was housed. The initial search for a new base was conducted by General Jan Dodonna during the evacuation from Yavin 4. The Rebels eventually decided to establish their new base of operations on the ice planet Hoth in 1 ABY, with the Rebellion then spending the next two years building what became Echo Base. Over those two years, rebel engineers expanded ice caverns in a feat of engineering work. Once the area was finally carved and expanded, completing the base for use in 3 ABY, the Rebellion inhabited Echo Base for less than a month before the Empire discovered it.

Solo, who was not aboard the ship at all, then surprised Byrnloo and the others when he addressed Jabba from the entryway to the bay, having just arrived from the nearby cantina.\\n\\nThe Hutt chastised Solo for having not repaid him and for killing Greedo, another of his thugs, in the cantina. Solo then offered to repay the Hutt with interest using credits from a job he had just accepted from Kenobi. The two haggled over the interest amount that the smuggler would pay, settling on fifteen percent. Satisfied, Jabba called off his thugs, and Byrnloo and the others made their way out of the docking bay.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\n\", \"Following this, he left to celebrate in Chalmun's Cantina, only to be found by Solo, Chewbacca and an escaped prisoner named Phaedra. Upon being interrogated, Greedo told them the urn was stored in Tarkin's office on Coruscant and that the Falcon was in a docking bay in Mos Entha. Solo then punched Greedo and left him unconscious in the street as he and his crew left to retrieve the Falcon. Sometime later, Greedo was met by Tyra, who supplied him with burnt Ronto meat to pass off to Jabba as D'Naran's ashes. Despite Jabba's suspicions, the ploy worked and Greedo received the reward. He then met back up with Tyra, who told Greedo that he wanted to tie up loose ends since he still had a score to settle with Solo.\\n\\nGreedo was hunting Solo for the bounty Jabba placed on his head after the smuggler dropped a large shipment of illicit cargo owned by the Hutt to avoid Imperial arrest. A fellow Rodian bounty hunter named Neesh, who actually had been hired to kill Greedo before outsourcing the job to Spruch Goa, had encouraged Greedo to make a play at capturing Solo. Despite Neesh urging him to act alone when confronting Solo, Greedo hired Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba as backup.\\n\\nTo corner the smuggler, Greedo traveled to the Mos Eisley Cantina, where he also attempted to collect money owed to him by Bith musician Lirin Car'n. \", \"Greedo challenged Solo at the Mos Eisley Cantina, where, threatening Solo with his DT-12 heavy blaster pistol, he demanded that he pay the money to Jabba or to Greedo himself; or hand over Solo's legendary starship, the Millennium Falcon. When Solo replied that he would rather die than give up his ship, Greedo said that was indeed the idea before announcing that it was something he had been looking forward to for a long time. As Greedo pulled his trigger and said that he would end with him, Solo shot Greedo dead from beneath the table with his readily prepared blaster. Greedo missed Solo completely and the last thing that Greedo ever saw was a flash of bright light with a memory of bitter injustice. Greedo's body collapsed over the table, and his blood got over the surface.\\n\\nThe blaster shots and Greedo's death silenced the cantina for a brief moment as the various patrons turned to see Solo and the dead bounty hunter, with Solo getting up to leave immediately after as if nothing important had happened. As he left, he threw a few credits to Wuher to apologize for the mess. While his mind was more interested on Kenobi's display with the lightsaber, Wuher dragged Greedo's body out of the building and cleaned up the Rodian's blood. Cantina patron Ohwun De Maal later gave a statement on the incident and noted Greedo had unholstered his blaster.\\n\\n\", \"Jabba continued to operate in the Outer Rim after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, preserving his power base, despite the interference of Darth Sidious, the Galactic Emperor. After the destruction of the Death Star by the Rebel Alliance, the Emperor sent Darth Vader to negotiate a deal with Jabba to secure raw materials for Imperial military production. Jabba's alliance with the Empire allowed him and the Hutts to resist the Imperial crackdown against criminal elements in the Outer Rim, as well as rid the Hutt of his competitors.\\n\\nAfter the smuggler Han Solo failed to repay him for lost cargo, Jabba placed a high price on his head. Solo was eventually delivered to him by one of his bounty hunters, Boba Fett, as a gift from Darth Vader. However, this capture brought him to the attention of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who sought to rescue his friend from Jabba's imprisonment. As he attempted to execute the Jedi and his allies in the Great Pit of Carkoon, Jabba was choked to death by Leia Organa. With the Hutts unable to decide who would inherit Jabba's criminal ventures, many of his slaves, including the Niktos, were free, and his palace was occupied by his former Majordomo Bib Fortuna, who took his place as Daimyo of Tatooine until Fett killed and usurped him. \", \"The mission was a success and the spy was discovered. Jabba decided to collect on the debt that Vess' fellow BX commando droid, ND-5, owed him, sending Vess to acquire compromising information against Governor Thorden, an Imperial who had great control over the Empire's presence on the moon Toshara. Jabba intended to use the information to force Thorden to use his control over the moon to favor the Hutt Cartel, thus gaining an advantage over the Pyke Syndicate, which controlled almost all of Toshara. Vess was successful and delivered the information to Jabba at his palace.\\n\\nThe plan to rescue Solo was put in place upon the arrival of the protocol droid C-3PO and astromech droid R2-D2. R2 carried with him a message from Skywalker, who declared himself a Jedi Knight and announced his intention to bargain for Solo's life. The young Jedi said he would arrive soon, and he offered the two droids as a gift for the crime lord. Jabba boasted that there would be no bargain, however, and conscripted the two droids into his service. 3PO became his new translator, while R2 would serve drinks on Jabba's sail barge.\\n\\nLater, during a performance of the song \\\"Jedi Rocks\\\" by the Max Rebo Band, Jabba's personal dancer, Oola, resisted his advances toward her, and the Hutt activated the trapdoor and sent her to her death in the rancor pit. \", \"To corner the smuggler, Greedo traveled to the Mos Eisley Cantina, where he also attempted to collect money owed to him by Bith musician Lirin Car'n. However, Car'n was unable to pay as he had been robbed the previous night. Greedo allowed Car'n to live, raising his interest rate and giving him until next week to pay up, believing Car'n to be a waste of his time.\\n\\nGreedo was humiliated briefly at the Mos Eisley cantina when he was tripped by a piece of the instrument used by Ickabel G'ont, a member of the Modal Nodes. He decided to ignore the insult, seeing payback against Solo as sweeter than revenge on the Nodes. Upon entering the cantina, Greedo saw its bartender, Wuher, ordering the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to leave the premises. While the Rodian steeled himself mentally for the encounter, he thought about how his former lover Uncelta fell for Solo only to have the smuggler break her heart.\\n\\nWhile at the bar, Greedo saw Baba lose an arm to the lightsaber of Obi-Wan Kenobi due to assaulting Luke Skywalker, an event at which he merely laughed. However, this prevented Baba and Evazan from assisting Greedo, as had been previously planned, forcing the Rodian to improvise.\\n\\nGreedo challenged Solo at the Mos Eisley Cantina, where, threatening Solo with his DT-12 heavy blaster pistol, he demanded that he pay the money to Jabba or to Greedo himself; or hand over Solo's legendary starship, the Millennium Falcon. \", \"When Skywalker attempted to steal the thugs' collections for the day, they caught and threatened to kill him.

Solo's standing was jeopardized, however, when his ship, the Millennium Falcon, was boarded by Imperial authorities, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo.

However, Solo was stolen from Fett by the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate before he could reach Jabba's Palace, and as a consequence Jabba put a bounty on Fett himself. The bounty hunter then traveled to the palace to confront Jabba and was greeted at the entrance by the Hutt's majordomo, Bib Fortuna.\\n\\nFortuna explained that Jabba was not available, as he had left the palace to attend the Crimson Dawn's auction for Solo. The majordomo then suggested Fett leave as Mon and a crowd of other palace denizens emerged behind Fortuna with their weapons drawn and aimed at the bounty hunter.

She was captured, however, and Jabba sentenced her friends to die in the Great Pit of Carkoon. As the Rebels fought with Jabba's guards in a final attempt at escape, Boba personally confronted Luke Skywalker. He was quickly taken out of the fight by Solo, who accidentally hit Boba's jetpack while still blinded from the side effects of the carbon freezing.

Despite being otherwise immaterial, the user was at least capable of physical contact with others and could even fool advanced sensors and droids.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nThe power of Force projection originated with the Fallanassi order. In 34 ABY, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker projected his appearance from Ahch-To to Crait, where he confronted his nephew, Kylo Ren, during the Battle of Crait. The feat was so strenuous that it led to Skywalker's death, after which he became one with the Force. He carried a copy of Han Solo's dice with him that he left with General Leia Organa, who left them at the old Rebel base on the planet. Ren discovered the dice, which disappeared shortly after Skywalker's death.\\n\\nSkywalker's ability to project himself became known in the wider galaxy after his death, so the story of his stand against tyranny spread hope as the First Order invaded. Though some believed in Skywalker's power, others\\u2014such as First Order Commander Branwayne Spiftz\\u2014saw it as nothing more than a myth; Spiftz referred to the ability mockingly while chastising Lieutenant Aderat over the \\\"disappearing\\\" Minfar resistance fighters.\", \"\\nDespite the sympathy that Rey developed for Ren as a result of their connection and her long isolation, she chose to withdraw from their budding relationship, due to being unable to support Ren's actions against the Resistance and his machinations to rule the galaxy. Before his death, Snoke knew that Rey and Ren were the prophesied dyad in the Force. As the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, Ren vowed to destroy Rey for rejecting him after he entreated her to rule the galaxy by his side, but later confessed that he had no desire to hurt her. During the final days of the conflict, Ren was able to use their connection as a means of tracking Rey's location, first on Pasaana and later aboard his own flagship, the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast. Having discovered that they formed a Force dyad, Ren shared this information with Rey as well as the fact that it remained unknown to Darth Sidious at the time.\\n\\nWith their combined power as a dyad, Ren believed that together they could destroy Sidious and claim the Throne of the Sith, a proposition which Rey denied. Though stung by her rejection, Ren continued to pursue Rey at Sidious' behest, leading to their final confrontation on Kef Bir. As they fought on the wreckage of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, Ren's mother, General Leia Organa, died reaching out to her son in the Force. \", \"\\nWith the death of their Supreme Leader, the Elite Praetorian Guard encircled and engaged the two Force-sensitives, attempting to avenge their slain master. Kylo Ren and Rey drew their lightsabers and stood together as allies against the crimson armored sentinels. Despite the Guard's efforts, all eight were killed in battle. But while Ren had indeed turned against Snoke, killing the Supreme Leader in order to save Rey, the now former apprentice had no intention of turning from the darkness. As Rey beseeched him to call off the First Order's attack on the remaining Resistance transports, Ren saw a chance to fulfill what he believed was his birthright: ruling over the weaker beings of the galaxy.\\n\\nOnce more, Rey implored him to resist the temptations of the dark side, hoping to reach the side of Kylo Ren that was still Ben Solo. Believing that Rey was still clinging to the past, Ren revealed to her the full truth of the vision he saw when they touched hands, that Rey was in fact the daughter of insignificant junk dealers who sold her into child labor before dying in the desert of Jakku. He suspected that in her heart Rey already knew the truth but had suppressed the memory of her abandonment. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.7919454938714723, "reason": "The actual output aligns with the expected output regarding the cause of Luke's death and includes a citation [9], but it omits the detail that the technique used was specifically called 'Force projection.'", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "local model", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "______________________\n| TaskNode | Level == 0 |\n*******************************\nLabel: None\n\nInstructions:\nExtract the citation annotation of format [#] or [#, #] used in the answer `actual_output`, if not ciation is present return null\n\ncitation annotation:\n[9]\n \n \n__________________________________\n| BinaryJudgementNode | Level == 1 |\n************************************************\nLabel: None\n\nCriteria:\ntest whether `citation annotation` is present in the format [#] or [#. #] and not null\n\nVerdict: True\nReason: The citation annotation is present in the format [#] and is not null.\n \n \n________________________\n| VerdictNode | Level == 2 |\n**********************************\nVerdict: True\nType: GEval\n\nCriteria:\nNone\nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check whether the facts in 'actual output' contradicts any facts in 'expected output'\",\n    \"You should heavily penalize when 'actual output' is missin a citation of the format [#]\",\n    \"You should also moderately penalize omission of detail\",\n    \"Vague language, or contradicting OPINIONS, are not OK\",\n    \"do not check, comment, or penalize whether 'expected output' has citations\"\n]"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "local model", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}]}, "{\"actual_output\": \"Yoda hid from the Empire on the planet **Dagobah** [1][4][5].\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": \"Yoda hid from the Empire on Dagobah\", \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"On what planet did Yoda hide from the empire?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"# Yoda's lightsaber\\n\\n## Characteristics\\n\\nYoda's lightsaber smaller size was a unique quality matching its wielder's small stature.

After Yoda's death in 4 ABY, that lightsaber ended up in the possession of Yoda's last Jedi apprentice, Luke Skywalker.\", \"Although the planet's fauna, weather patterns, and non-existence on standard astrogation charts made it an ideal place to hide, Yoda lived in exile there for a deeper purpose than to live a life of hardship or to hide from the fledgling Galactic Empire. Without distractions or any means of leaving the world to confront the Sith on his own, Yoda was allowed to ponder ancient Jedi texts, meditate on the deepest mysteries of the Force, and communicate with other Jedi such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ezra Bridger. Patiently waiting until he would be called to help the children of Anakin Skywalker to restore balance to the Force as well as the Jedi Order to maintain it, Yoda lived a modest existence, meditating and studying Dagobah's strength in the Living Force whilst also monitoring the Skywalker twins.\\n\\nThe energy of all life, the Living Force was particularly affected by sentient beings. Feeling emotions and capable of intelligence, sentients' actions echoed deeply in the Living Force throughout galactic history. Qui-Gon Jinn was a student of the Living Force, and stressed its importance to his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, telling him that being mindful of the Living Force required him to keep his concentration on the here and now, rather than letting anxieties about the future come at the expense of the present moment. \", \"As the Clone Wars progressed, Yoda decided to alleviate Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker's fear and inability to lose loved ones by assigning him a Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano. He believed that by becoming a teacher, Skywalker would develop emotionally and that when the time came for Tano to go off on her own, he would understand that his excessive bonding to those he cared about was unnecessary. Tano traveled to the planet of Christophsis, where she presented herself to Skywalker in the midst of a battle against Confederate forces.\\n\\nAfter the battle had concluded, Yoda, himself, arrived on the planet and assigned the duo to the task of finding Rotta, the son of influential Hutt crime lord Jabba, who had been kidnapped as part of a plan arranged by his uncle Ziro to alienate the Hutts and the Jedi and drag the former into war.

Simultaneously, the Confederacy dispatched Asajj Ventress, an assassin trained by Confederate leader Dooku, to the moon with droid escort to pressure Katuunko into siding with the Separatists.\\n\\n\", \"However, the Dagobah wet season created a need for the Jedi Master to regularly relocate to the planet's highlands for the duration. Following the destruction of the Jedi Order, Yoda was listed as one of the Inquisitorius' priority targets amongst presumed survivors of the Great Jedi Purge.\\n\\nAround a year after Order 66, Tano was hiding on the world of Thabeska, where she had met a Force-sensitive child named Hedala Fardi. Despite her young age, the child proved to be wise, and Tano was upset that Fardi would likely never be able to prove her wisdom to Yoda. Later, while sleeping aboard the CR90 corvette Tantive IV after Organa offered her a chance to join his rebellion, Tano remembered Yoda's advice to her when she was getting her first kyber crystal. Awaking and knowing she should make a new set of lightsabers, she thanked Yoda, even though she knew he could not possibly hear or help her.\\n\\nDuring his exile on Dagobah, Yoda kept an eye on other Jedi throughout the galaxy, including those who ventured into the various Jedi Temples found amongst the stars. Approximately four years before the Battle of Yavin, Yoda spoke to Kanan Jarrus, who had been the Padawan of Depa Billaba and a survivor of Order 66. Jarrus had traveled to the Jedi Temple on the planet Lothal with his own Padawan, Ezra Bridger, to whom Yoda also spoke. \", \"Jedi temples were often built at Force vergences, which were created by life living in a harmonious, if primordial, balance. The lush biosphere of the planet Dagobah made it one of the strongest vergences in the galaxy; the great quantities of life thriving in concert on the world created Dagobah's Living Force, which resonated to the extent of overwhelming Force-sensitives. With an unusually high concentration of the Living Force coursing across Dagobah, the planet allowed for even the most powerful Force users to camouflage themselves within its echoes. Verdant swamps and jungles on the world formed wellsprings of the Living Force\\u2014eddies, whirlpools, and springs in the cosmic flow of the Force that came and went with it. Sentients connecting to the flow of the Force at such wellsprings could deeped their understanding of the duality of life and death, as well as the nature of reality beyond what was possible in other locations.\\n\\nHowever, sentience never developed on Dagobah, where there was simply the pure ebb and flow of life itself.

Yoda joked that losing a planet must be embarrassing for Kenobi, eliciting a giggle from the younglings. He then had them all gather around the room's map reader, from which Kenobi projected a holographic star map and showed where the planet ought to be. After Jempa's classmate J. K.

As spirits, the luminous Jedi retained their identities after death to guide the living, ensuring that the next generation would grow beyond them and better the galaxy.\", \"While unconscious, Qui-Gon's voice requested Yoda go to Dagobah, and to tell no one about it. After, Obi-Wan broke open the tank due to his concern over Yoda's failing life signs.\\n\\nPut on bedrest and under guard, Yoda convinced Anakin to help him escape by posing as simply accompanying each other for a walk. Guided to the Jedi Temple Hangar, Anakin lent Yoda his astromech droid, R2-D2 to accompany him to his personal interceptor.

The mercenary Baylan Skoll referred to his employer, the witch Morgan Elsbeth, as \\\"Lady Morgan.\\\"\\n\\nDuring the War of the Bounty Hunters, the Galactic Empire's ally, Tagge Corporation, was led by Lady Domina Tagge, while the Crimson Dawn syndicate was led by Lady Qi'ra. Lando Calrissian's yacht was named the Lady Luck.\", \"# Sterling\\n\\nSterling was the nickname of a clone trooper of the 332nd Division within the Galactic Republic's 501st Legion who took part in the Siege of Mandalore in 19 BBY. During the siege, Sterling and his unit traveled to reinforce C-deck in the Undercity of the planet Mandalore's capital city of Sundari, but they were ambushed by renegade Sith Lord Maul. While fighting in the ambush, Sterling was wounded by a blaster hit to the torso, and his unit sustained heavy casualties. Sterling reported to the division's military advisor, Ahsoka Tano, about the ambush and informed her that Advanced Recon Commando Jesse had been taken hostage by Maul.\\n\\n## Biography\\n\\nSterling was a clone of the human male Jango Fett and was born on the world of Kamino. In the final days of the galactic-wide conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems known as the Clone Wars in 19 BBY, Sterling was part of the 332nd Division, which conducted the siege of the planet Mandalore under the leadership of the newly appointed Clone Commander Rex alongside former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who acted as an advisor. Sterling was among the clone troopers who successfully landed at Mandalore's capital city of Sundari, where he also participated in and survived the opening skirmishes against rogue Mandalorian super commandos.\\n\\n\", \"Ahsoka Tano, appointed as the Padawan of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker early in the Clone Wars, became disillusioned with the Jedi Order after being framed for treason by her former friend and fellow Padawan Barriss Offee. Having been expelled from the Order prior to her trial, Tano was offered a promotion to the rank of Knight, but rejected it and chose to leave the Order for good.\\n\\nTano spent a period of time wandering the city planet of Coruscant, acquiring a junky Joben T-85 speeder bike. Eventually, the bike malfunctioned as she was entering an underworld portal, sending her plummeting all the way down to Level 1313, where she made a crash landing on the landing platform of a repair shop owned by Trace Martez. Tano quickly befriended Trace, but her older sister Rafa Martez, a cynical gambler, remained suspicious of her and her motives, feeling she might be using her somehow. After helping Trace chase down a rampaging Type II loadlifter droid that Rafa had been hired to build, Tano was invited to stick around for as long as she needed to, an offer she eventually accepted when Trace asked her to help test her self-assembled starship, the Silver Angel. Choosing to keep her past secret from the sisters, Tano fudged the truth when asked where she was from and how she had learned things like how to fight and where she had worked on starships, and avoided using her Force powers where they would be noticeable.\\n\\n\", \"Tano eventually gave the sisters an opportunity to escape by claiming to want to cut a deal with Krim by herself, asserting that the sisters had hidden the spice offworld and giving them the opportunity to retrieve it, with the threat of retaliation against their family if they failed, Krim being unaware that the sisters had no living relatives. Rafa, touched at the gesture, came up with a plan to steal spice from the Pykes' loading docks to give to the Pykes so they could free Tano. Meanwhile, attempting to escape from their stronghold and destroy their spice refining facility, Tano discovered that the Pykes were working for the Sith Lord Darth Maul. When Tano was recaptured again, Krim and Fife discovered she was a Force-user and assumed she was on an undercover mission for the Jedi and Galactic Republic. When the sisters came back for her, the three were able to escape Oba Diah again, although the truth of Tano's past was revealed to the Martezes. Tano believed that the sisters were safe from retaliation due to her apparent status as a Republic operative. However, after returning to Coruscant, Tano was immediately recruited by Kryze, who had followed them from the Outer Rim, to help deal with Maul.\\n\\n## Prelude\\n\\nAhsoka Tano, appointed as the Padawan of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker early in the Clone Wars, became disillusioned with the Jedi Order after being framed for treason by her former friend and fellow Padawan Barriss Offee. \", \"The two would often butt heads, each believing that they knew better than the other. During their first mission together at the Battle of Christophsis, they developed demeaning nicknames for each other; Tano gave her master the diminutive title \\\"Skyguy,\\\" while Skywalker returned the favor with the name \\\"Snips,\\\" referring to Tano's snippy wit. Tano used the nickname Skyguy only because it annoyed Skywalker, although, as the war progressed, these nicknames would remain by changing into more playful terms of friendship. Skywalker also quickly came to respect Tano's bravery and determination, and he recognized that Tano was just as reckless as him.\\n\\nFor all their bickering, the two developed a close relationship during the Clone Wars. Skywalker reassured his Padawan that their meeting was no accident and that it was the will of the Force for her to train under him. Their rapport made it's way onto the battlefield, with the duo competing to see who could destroy the most droids during the Second Battle of Geonosis. The master and apprentice grew increasingly reliant on each other throughout the war, taking turns rescuing each other from Separatist forces and bounty hunters. After situations where she was nearly killed, she found that she could talk to her mentor to come to terms with it. Tano's naive outlook balanced with Skywalker's cynical approach. During her time on Mortis, Tano was killed by the Son and only resurrected after Skywalker pleaded with the Father to help save her. \", \"\\nAt birth, like the other clone troopers, Sterling was implanted by the Kaminoan scientists with a behavioral modification biochip to ensure that the trooper would not resist certain orders. Sterling was equipped with a set of Phase II clone trooper armor, which along with that of other troopers of the 332nd Division of the 501st Legion was decorated to match Tano's Togruta coloration and lekku markings.\", \"\\nAt some point later, Tano flew a TIE fighter that had been repainted by Wren after it was stolen by the Spectres during a \\\"meiloorun run\\\" gone wrong.\\n\\nAfter the crew of the Ghost joined the Phoenix Squadron, Ahsoka Tano acted as a mentor and adviser to the newer rebels. She had a particular affinity with Kanan and his apprentice Ezra Bridger, fellow Jedi who were resisting the Empire. On one occasion, Tano and Bridger traveled to a planet where Bridger was practicing his lightsaber form. While Bridger practiced, Tano startled Bridger and asked him where he got his weapon. Bridger explained the origin of his weapon and handed it to Tano. With the weapon, Tano took out the kyber crystal and asked Bridger how he felt to be one of the only ones in the galaxy with a lightsaber. With his response not satisfying her, she decided to teach Bridger a lesson and tossed the crystal into a nearby field. Exasperated, Bridger was tossed back his weapon as Tano activated one of her own. Tano began to swing her lightsaber at Bridger who believed he had no way to defend himself as he questioned her motives. As Tano continued to attack Bridger, she let him focus on the Force to evade her, while simultaneously searching for where his crystal had landed. As he evaded, Bridger eventually discovered his crystal and activated his lightsaber to stop Tano's oncoming blade. \", \"\\nSometime later, Sterling's unit was sent with Advanced Recon Commando Clone Lieutenant Jesse to reinforce C-deck in Sundari's Undercity, but they were ambushed by renegade Sith Lord Maul, who brutally cut through the Republic forces. Sterling was wounded by a blaster shot to his chest, though he survived, unlike most of the unit, which sustained heavy casualties. Sterling also witnessed Maul capturing Jesse after he had determined through the use of a Force mind probe that the clone was older than the rest of his unit.\\n\\nShortly after, Ahsoka Tano was informed of Maul's attack and quickly made her way to the site of the skirmish alongside Commander Rex. Upon seeing her, Sterling, who was supported by a fellow clone and was sitting against a wall in pain from his injuries, summoned Tano to him, respectfully addressing her as \\\"Commander\\\" despite her lack of military rank. He explained to her what had occurred, recounting Maul's ferocity, and he reached out and grabbed her arm as he emphasized that Maul had taken Jesse captive.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\nAs with the other clones of Jango Fett, Sterling stood 1.83 meters tall  and weighed eighty kilograms. He had brown eyes, tan skin, and sported a short black haircut. Sterling addressed Ahsoka Tano with her former military rank, befitting her status as a former Jedi and leader of the clones. Sterling insisted that Tano needed to know what happened when Maul attacked.\\n\\n## Equipment\\n\\n\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.8387942584607693, "reason": "The actual output includes citations [1][2], which is a positive, but it slightly overstates detail by specifying 'Jedi Knight' instead of 'Jedi Master' as in the expected output.

Lando Calrissian, with the help of his his old friend L3-37, one of the droid brains of the Falcon, was able to fix the diagnostic computer.\", \"# Docking Bay 328\\n\\nDocking Bay 328 was a docking bay constructed in the western hemisphere of the Galactic Empire's Death Star superweapon, falling under the control of Station Control West. When, in the year 0 BBY, the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon was pulled by tractor beam into Docking Bay 327, the bay was put on lockdown and all its traffic was diverted into Docking Bays 328 and 329, causing a seven minute delay. Shortly after the Falcon escaped, the docking bay was destroyed along with the rest of the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin.\", \"# Millennium Falcon\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon, originally designated YT 492727ZED and formerly known as the Stellar Envoy, and registered or known under various aliases and pseudonyms including Broken Bell, Corell's Pride, Close Shave, Fickle Flyer, Foul Matter, Graphite Skipper, Jin-Den Smoke, Longshot, Lost and Found, Star Princess, Sunfighter Franchise, Sweet Suprise, Meetyl's Misery, Wayward Son, and Victory Ring, was a Corellian YT-1300 light freighter built around 60 BBY. Earning a legendary status under their ownership, the ship was most famously used by the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca before, during, and following the Galactic Civil War.\\n\\nDuring the Falcon's time in the possession of the smuggler Lando Calrissian, it accumulated numerous modifications in the name of convenience and luxury, including painted exterior paneling and a large escape pod. However, during Han Solo's famous record-breaking Kessel Run, in which he piloted the freighter for the first time, many of these additions were destroyed or lost, leaving the ship battered by the time Solo won it from Calrissian shortly afterwards in a game of sabacc. Its aged appearance still belied numerous advanced modifications to boost the ship's speed, weapons, and shields, including a hyperdrive engine among the fastest in the entire galaxy, enabling it to outrun Imperial Star Destroyers. It also included sensor-proof smuggling compartments, which were used during the rescue of Princess Leia Organa in 0 BBY to evade Imperial stormtroopers. \", \"# Stasis-type shield generator\\n\\nThe Novaldex stasis-type shield generator was a device that worked in a crucial system that prevented passengers aboard a starship from aging at a drastically different rate than 'realspace time' when traveling through hyperspace. The Millennium Falcon used a stasis-type shield generator to suport its Torplex shield generator by feeding the port and starboard projectors.\", \"# Takodana Ship\\n\\nThe Takodana Ship was a Starship model. A ship of this type was standing on the shore of Nymeve Lake on Takodana when the Millennium Falcon landed next to it.\", \"Following Solo's death soon after, the Millennium Falcon became a Resistance vessel piloted by its new owner, Rey, throughout much of the First Order-Resistance War. In 35 ABY, the ship was once again captained by Calrissian during the Battle of Exegol, which saw a decisive victory for the Resistance and Jedi Order, before being returned to Rey, who had been newly dubbed a Skywalker.\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon was a YT-1300 light freighter of the YT-1300f variety. Its basic shape was defined by two convex saucers welded together, a pair of front-facing mandibles and an outrigger-style, side-mounted cockpit with transparisteel viewports. Apart from the shape of its chassis, the Falcon retained very little of its off-the-dock instrumentation. Because its successive owners either upgraded or downgraded every system according to their personal specifications, the freighter ended up becoming a unique ship. These customizations, however, came at the price of reliability, and the Falcon was known to suffer frequent breakdowns in the heat of battle. After the circular military-grade sensor dish was lost during the Battle of Endor, the dish was replaced with the base rectangular model which was originally supplied with the ship. During the Battle of Crait, the Falcon again lost its rectenna, and it was replaced with a military-grade rectenna similar to that of the one lost during the Battle of Endor. \", \"The cruiser eventually exploded into a large fireball, and the Millennium Falcon flew through the fire and wreckage as Vader chased the latter in his TIE Advanced x1. The maneuver allowed the Millennium Falcon to have more distance before it launched the rebel C-3PO in a Model CEC Class-1 escape pod into the rebel flagship Republic to inform the crew about details they had learned to circumvent Shu-Torun systems.\\n\\nAfter the Republic's starfighters launched, Force-sensitive pilot Luke Skywalker and his unit, Rogue Squadron, ignited a display trail to gain the attention of the other rebel Mon Calamari cruisers and flew near the bay doors of the Geist, another cruiser of the class. When the ship's bay doors opened in response to detecting the rebel transponder, Admiral Ackbar ordered all fighters to launch if the bay doors responded to the transponders; the Geist thus launched its fighters. After Princess Organa and rebel forces investigated and located the transponder codes to deactivate Shu-Torun system blocks on the Executor, the rebels used the Shu-Torun cruiser to board the Imperial flagship. By this time, the battle had escalated, and more cruisers of the class were under attack and exploding. Organa's circumvention of the blockers allowed the Republic to escape.\\n\\nAfter regrouping, the Republic returned to the Mako-Ta docks and attacked the Executor while several rebel transports landed on the surviving cruisers, including several of the class, and distributed the override codes. \", \"\\nAt this time, Vader's Imperial Death Squadron arrived and, after pausing to foster fear, attacked the Alliance Fleet, which was caught defenseless, exposed, and without the ability to launch starfighters. Vader's flagship, the Super Star Destroyer Executor, first attacked Yavin's Hope, the flagship of General Vanden Willard, destroying it. Afterward, the Imperial fleet attacked various Mon Calamari vessels, and one cruiser of the class was near another model of Mon Calamari ship. By the time the Rebel YT-1300 light freighter named the Millennium Falcon arrived at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, Commander Lajaie's cruiser was attacked by the Executor as the rebels attempted to break through the system failure. Not having enough time, Commander Lajaie ordered all crew to evacuate the cruiser with the escape pods and for those who survived to inform other rebel personnel that some operating systems could be bypassed and further details that they learned about the failures.\\n\\nWhile sustaining a barrage, Lajaie's cruiser began exploding as its escape pods launched. Under orders from Vader, Imperial forces targeted the escape pods, and many were destroyed by TIE fighters. The cruiser eventually exploded into a large fireball, and the Millennium Falcon flew through the fire and wreckage as Vader chased the latter in his TIE Advanced x1. \", \"\\nThe weaponry of the Millennium Falcon was normally suited for a much larger warship. It included two CEC AG-2G quad laser cannons  with enhanced laser actuators and gas feeds, which gave them maximum range and damage. These served as its primary defensive armament, able to destroy enemy fighters with a single direct hit. Between the forward mandibles, there were two Arakyd ST2 concussion missile tubes, each of which carried a four-missile magazine. Additionally, a BlasTech Ax-108 \\\"Ground Buzzer\\\" blaster cannon mounted near the ventral boarding ramp allowed its crew to defend the ship against infantry and other light targets while on the ground.\\nDuralloy plates salvaged from an Imperial cruiser afforded the Falcon capital ship-class hull armor.\\n\\nThe ship had three deflector shield generators: the bow was protected from both lasers and concussion missiles by Torplex and Nordoxicon units, while a Kuat Drive Yards generator shielded the stern.\\n\\nThe Falcon's combination of sublight speed and maneuverability was comparable to most of the starfighters fielded by the Rebellion and Empire, while its shielding, hyperdrive, heavy armor and weapons were on par with those typically found on capital ships These traits made it an ideal choice for General Lando Calrissian's attack run within the bowels of the Death Star during the Battle of Endor. While agile and almost near impervious to almost all heavy weapons and turbolasers as any large warship, the Falcon's only real combat weakness was its sheer size in comparison to starfighters. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.7827498049449926, "reason": "The actual output provides accurate information and includes citations, which is a positive.

Common traits included a helmet with a T-shaped visor, called a macrobinocular viewplate, that concealed their faces, and armaments like vambraces and jetpacks.\\n\\nThe Mandalorians' bloody history made their armor an iconic symbol of fear. Mandalorian armor was typically made from beskar, which was one of the strongest metals in the galaxy, but it could also be made from more common metals such as durasteel. Beskar could protect the wearer from blasters and even lightsabers. The famed Mandalorian bounty hunter and foundling Jango Fett wore customized armor made of beskar alloy, which was later inherited by his cloned son Boba.\\n\\nThe Arc Pulse Generator, an Imperial superweapon, was capable of superheating the beskar alloy used in Mandalorian armor to incinerate its wearer.\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nGenerally the armor was made from beskar, a highly durable metal which could repel blaster fire and lightsaber strikes. A beskar spear was capable of piercing Mandalorian armor. Identified as a macrobinocular viewplate, the helmets had an angled visor.\\n\\nDue to the durability of the beskar metal, some armor sets were hundreds of years old, such as in the case of Sabine Wren's armor.

In order to sneak into the Temple of the Kyber in 382 BBY, Path member Yana Ro was provided with a set of slightly outdated robes by her reluctant ally, the corrupt chief archivist Feric Oranalli. While Ro mockingly thought that Oranalli's description of the apparel as outdated made it seem like the Jedi cared about always staying slightly ahead of fashion trends, the robes worked just fine as a way to sneak in.\\n\\nDuring the High Republic Era, two Jedi, Barash Silvain and Porter Engle, developed a bond akin to that of siblings. Despite working closely together as they traveled throughout the galaxy, they adopted contrasting clothing in line with their opposing attitudes; Engle wore a set of dark robes, although some of his central robes and his sleeves were lighter, while Silvain adopted radiantly white apparel. Much of her outer robes and her hood were tan.

Without alterations to the template, the clone would be an exact duplicate of its progenitor. By manipulating the genetic structure of the template, a clone's genotype could be modified for various purposes such as growth acceleration and greater docility.\\n\\nA single genetic sample taken from an original organism was sufficient to grow millions of clones. Host samples degraded over time, however, making the donor essential for replacement samples. The cloning process could be sustained without the original host, but only by rationing the last viable samples of DNA.

Shortly thereafter, the entire clone army was decommissioned and replaced by birth-born stormtroopers.\\n\\nThe Empire ultimately fell to the New Republic after the Emperor's destruction.

Count Dooku, posing as a Jedi to the Kaminoan cloners, provided the Kaminoans with a bio-chip to be implanted into the clones during the early phase of their growth period.

His followers, the Sith Eternal, experimented with Sidious' template in the hope of creating a more suitable vessel. Their efforts produced various Strand-Casts, including Supreme Leader Snoke and multiple genetic copies of him, as well as a modified clone that was healthy yet lacked Sidious' connection to the Force.

Kenobi reported his findings to his superiors, Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu, who ordered him to bring the hunter to the Jedi Grand Temple on Coruscant for interrogation.\\n\\nFollowing the death of Jango Fett in the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, the Kaminoans were forced to conserve their remaining samples of the Fett genome in order to grow more clones for the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic.

Naboo was pushed to the forefront of galactic politics as the birthplace of the Dark Lord of the Sith Sheev Palpatine, who served as its representative in the Senate of the Galactic Republic.\\n\\nUnder the guise of his Sith title Darth Sidious, Palpatine secretly engineered an invasion of his peaceful homeworld by the Trade Federation, a megacorporation in a bid for power. Ostensibly done in protest over proposed taxation of formerly free trade routes, the Federation's invasion led to an outpouring of support from the Senate for both Palpatine and the newly-elected Queen of Naboo, Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. Amidala led a successful resistance movement and removed the Federation from her world during the Battle of Naboo. Palpatine subsequently rose to the office of the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, with Amidala eventually taking his place as the planet's senatorial representative.\\n\\nNaboo would commit itself firmly to democracy in the intervening years, staying loyal to the Republic during the pan-galactic Clone Wars, which saw several military engagements against the Confederacy of Independent Systems come to the planet.

One of Amidala's final projects, which continued under the reign of her successor, was the implementation of an ion pulse in Theed in case of future invasions. The decision to install the pulse, whilst meeting with general approval, was nevertheless controversial as some, such as Quarsh Panaka, favored the idea of more robust and extensive defenses whilst others felt that installing any weapon system was against everything Naboo stood for in terms of peace.\\n\\nA series of miners strikes occurred on the moons of Naboo.

The invasion itself had been orchestrated by Naboo's Senator Sheev Palpatine, who was secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, in a successful effort to be elected Supreme Chancellor.

He was known as Darth Maul as the apprentice of Darth Sidious. Having trained in the ways of the Force, Darth Maul was a formidable warrior strong with the dark side and possessed deadly skills in lightsaber combat. After he lost his place as the Dark Lord of the Sith at Sidious' side, Maul remained a scheming mastermind who plotted to gain ever more power.\\n\\nBorn in 54 BBY during the era of the Galactic Republic, Maul was the son of Mother Talzin, leader of the Nightsisters of Dathomir. Maul also had two siblings, the Nightbrothers Savage Opress and Feral. Sensing his potential, Sidious took Maul as an apprentice while he was still a child in 40 BBY. Anointed by his Sith Master as Darth Maul, the Dathomirian was raised to hate the Jedi Knights that served the light side of the Force. Desiring to see the Jedi Order fall, Darth Maul trained for the day when the Sith would exact revenge on their ancient foes. The time for revealing the Sith's continued existence to the Jedi came during the Invasion of Naboo, when Darth Maul confronted Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. Though he killed Jinn, Maul was, in turn, defeated by Kenobi, who bisected the Sith assassin at the waist. \", \"At the Selection Arena, Maul found out that the visitor was Sidious. In a sudden burst of anger, he used the Dark Side of the Force to Force-choke the two brothers, and then the keeper, all in front of Sidious and Talzin. Beyond pleased at Maul's progress and potential, Sidious declared Maul the winner and his new apprentice, to Talzin's dismay. Sidious took Maul and left Dathomir, Talzin swearing to get her stolen son back and have her revenge on Sidious.\\n\\nUnder Sidious's tutelage, Maul trained as a Sith apprentice, Sith warrior, and Sith assassin, eventually being given the title \\\"Darth Maul.\\\" For years, Darth Maul was trained to become a weapon of the Sith. He became an acrobatic warrior, one trained to be relentless against his enemies, and learned to use a dual-bladed lightsaber, eventually crafting his own, using plans given to him by his master. The plans had been hidden by Sidious in a forgotten entrance in the ancient Sith archives. For his lightsaber, Maul used pieces that he had stolen or otherwise acquired. As he noted to himself while sitting in darkness in the time before the Chommell sector summit, a large amount of pain and blood that had gone into the construction of his weapon. However, the majority of the blood that had been spilt in the creation of the weapon was not his. During lightsaber training, Maul trained with Marksman-H training remotes. He also learned martial arts through droid training.\\n\\n\", \"He even put up a reasonable fight against Darth Sidious on Mandalore when they dueled with dual blades, going as far as landing a kick on the Dark Lord. After the Clone Wars, Maul demonstrated the ability to wield an additional weapon alongside his double-bladed lightsaber, on one occasion using a walking stick as a club in conjunction with his connected blades.\\n\\nMaul could destroy numerous enemies, including Banking Clan droid guards, pirates, Hutt Clan forces, hordes of Separatist battle droids, clone troopers, and four of General Grievous' MagnaGuards. He also held his own against Mace Windu and Aayla Secura on a Mandalorian supply outpost, the elder Jedi being a longtime famed member of the High Council; this was a fight that Maul deemed \\\"fair.\\\" He successfully overpowered the infamous Jedi hunter General Grievous; though he fought to a stalemate with the cyborg in their first duel, he overwhelmed him in their second and third encounters.\\n\\nOver a decade later, Maul's fighting prowess was still as sharp as ever. While on Malachor, he aided Ahsoka Tano and Kanan Jarrus against three members of the Inquisitorius, defeating them easily. He also battled Tano and Jarrus, in turn, but lost the high ground to Jarrus whom he blinded with his lightsaber.\\n\\nDespite Maul's dueling skills, Darth Sidious defeated both him and his brother Savage Opress. Though he pressed Sidious on his back foot, he was disarmed before being manhandled by the elder Sith Lord's Force powers. \", \"Maul used his lightsaber against Jedi Knight Finn Ertay and an an unidentified Nikto Jedi at an Outer Rim spaceport, murdering the former by running her through from behind whilst she was distracted. Following his duel with the two Jedi, Maul used his lightsaber to cut through several security droids at the Cybloc Transfer Station in order to raid the station. After finding a vault, Maul used his lightsaber against his brother in order to prove himself as the master and Savage, his apprentice.\\n\\nAt Florrum, Maul used his lightsaber to force several pirates under Jiro of Captain Hondo Ohnaka's gang to join him. After killing one of Hondo's loyal lieutenants, Maul fought Kenobi while Savage fought Adi Gallia.\\n\\nWhen Maul and Opress were found by the Mandalorian Death Watch, Pre Vizsla took Maul's lightsaber as the two Zabraks recovered. Maul was given back his lightsaber after Vizsla agreed to an alliance between Death Watch and Maul. Maul used his lightsaber against the various criminals of Black Sun and the Hutt Clan, as he was planning to form a united criminal organization, the Shadow Collective.\\n\\nFollowing the Shadow Collective's takeover of Mandalore, the Death Watch betrayed Maul and Savage and imprisoned them, with Bo-Katan wearing Maul's lightsaber on her belt. After escaping from the Sundari prison, Maul challenged Vizsla to a duel to the death, and Vizsla order Katan to give Maul his weapon so Maul can duel Vizsla. \", \"This left Maul with only one functional half of it. Despite this, Maul was able to push Kenobi and kick his lightsaber into a pit and used his lightsaber to shower sparks at the young Jedi and force him to let go. When Maul lowered his guard, Kenobi saw his chance and jumped towards him. Using Jinn's lightsaber, Kenobi seemingly killed Maul by cutting him in half. Maul and his lightsaber fell down the shaft, presumed dead and lost.\\n\\nIn truth, Maul survived and was found on Lotho Minor by his brother, Savage Opress, who returned Maul to Dathomir to be healed by their mother, Talzin. Maul's lightsaber was given back to him by his brother and he used it in his quest for vengeance against Kenobi.\\n\\nMaul used it to kill innocent villagers on Raydonia in order to bring Kenobi to him. When Kenobi arrived, Maul and his brother fought and subdue Kenobi. Maul planned to use his lightsaber to torture Kenobi until Asajj Ventress arrived. Maul and his brother fought Kenobi and Ventress until they escaped.\\n\\nMaul continued to use this lightsaber as he and his brother cut a swath across the Outer Rim. Maul used his lightsaber against Jedi Knight Finn Ertay and an an unidentified Nikto Jedi at an Outer Rim spaceport, murdering the former by running her through from behind whilst she was distracted. \", \"\\nDuring the Clone Wars, Besalisk Jedi Master Pong Krell wielded dual-hinged double-bladed lightsabers, one blue-bladed and one green-bladed, which could fold at the middle. The Lasat Jedi Master Jaro Tapal also made use of a double-bladed lightsaber throughout the Clone Wars and to defend himself and his Padawan during the execution of Order 66, though the weapon was sundered in half by clone blasterfire. The Jedi Temple Guard wielded a similar weapon, the yellow double-bladed lightsaber pike. A yellow double-bladed lightsaber was used by the Zygerrian Jedi Master Tosan. A blue double-bladed lightsaber was also used by a human Jedi that was present for the Massacre on Zondula.\\n\\nThe Imperial Inquisitors, dark side adepts tasked at identifying and hunting down Jedi following Order 66, fought using their unique version of the weapon. Their red double-bladed spinning lightsabers could also be used as regular single-bladed lightsabers.\\n\\nDuring the Imperial Era, Maul used another double-bladed lightsaber, which could be disguised as a cane and bore strong visual similarities to the lightsabers wielded by members of the Inquisitorius. Maul wielded this lightsaber until his death on Tatooine at the hands of his old enemy Kenobi a few years before the Battle of Yavin.\\n\\nWhile searching for the wayfinder on Kef Bir in 35 ABY, Rey fought a vision of herself as a Sith. In the vision, her dark side counterpart wielded a hinged double-bladed lightsaber with red blades.\", \"\\nThe Dathomirian Zabrak Sith Lord Darth Maul wielded a red double-bladed lightsaber he created himself. Maul's lightsaber was damaged when he was defeated by Obi-Wan Kenobi during the Battle of Naboo. Savage Opress, Maul's brother, also wielded a red double-bladed lightsaber he received from Count Dooku during his brief stint as the Sith Lord's apprentice. When Opress recovered Maul from the junk planet Lotho Minor, Maul only had one half of his old lightsaber. He wielded it as a single-bladed lightsaber for a time, but by the time of the Siege of Mandalore, he had rebuilt it into a double-bladed weapon. However, he lost the saber for good when he was captured by Ahsoka Tano during the Siege.\\n\\nA weapon that previously belonged to a different apprentice, Count Dooku's personal assassin and apprentice Asajj Ventress had a pair of curved-hilt lightsabers that could be joined together at the hilt into a single weapon by a locking mechanism, becoming a double-bladed lightsaber.

This was a configuration known as a split saber, one that was also fielded by Jedi such as Cal Kestis, who built a double-bladed lightsaber from the pieces of his master Jaro Tapal's broken double-bladed lightsaber, which Kestis had used as a single-bladed weapon after Tapal's death and the loss of his own lightsaber, combining what was salvageable from Tapal's weapon with pieces of his new master Cere Junda's lightsaber.\\n\\n\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.8294521170662168, "reason": "The actual output aligns with the expected output, providing accurate details about Darth Maul's background and weapon.

He spoke a fractured, heavily accented form of Basic known as Anzellan.\\n\\n## Biography\\n\\nBabu Frik worked for the Spice Runners of Kijimi on the planet of Kijimi for some time before the Cold War. When Zorii Bliss and Poe Dameron and members of the gang went to Quintil to rescue Tomasso, Bliss asked after Frik. Later, after Bliss and Dameron were inducted as Spice Runners, Bliss brought Dameron and their damaged droid companion EV-6B6 to Babu, who fixed the droid for them. When Dameron abandoned the group to join the New Republic, Babu allowed him to take a holographic disguise matrix so he could sneak offworld. Sometime after the Battle of Crait, Kijimi fell under First Order occupation, which made life more difficult for Babu and the band of spice runners.\\n\\nDuring the war between the First Order and the Resistance, a group of Resistance members consisting of Rey, Finn, Chewbacca, BB-8, C-3PO, and the now Resistance Commander Poe Dameron recovered a Sith dagger.

Sometimes referred to as Threepio, he was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.\\n\\nC-3PO was rebuilt from spare parts by Anakin Skywalker, a human slave who lived in Mos Espa, a city on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. During the Clone Wars, he would serve the Naboo Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. Shortly after the Clone Wars, C-3PO's memory was erased, though R2-D2's memory was not. C-3PO and R2-D2 were assigned to the Alderaan cruiser Tantive IV, where they served senator Bail Organa for nineteen years, assisting in his fledgling resistance movement against the Galactic Empire. At some point during this time, C-3PO's right leg was fitted with mismatched plating.\\n\\nC-3PO remained constant companions with R2, and in 0 BBY, the pair became embroiled in the Galactic Civil War when Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance entrusted them to bring a copy of the Death Star plans to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. \", \"C-3PO's inability to lie came at a disadvantage when he and his companions were captured by Ewoks prior to the Battle of Endor. Due to his general inability to keep secrets, Bail Organa arranged for him to receive a memory wipe in order to preserve the secret of Anakin and Padm\\u00e9's offspring, Luke and Leia.\\n\\nThreepio's programming, focused on etiquette and protocol, impacted his personality and limited his behavior in several other ways. On Endor, he found it difficult to impersonate a deity due to his programming, and during the attack on the Resistance fleet, he attempted to leave a mutiny in progress because it was not correct protocol.\\n\\nC-3PO continued serving Leia Organa in her careers as New Republic senator and subsequently Resistance General. C-3PO managed General Organa's Resistance droid spy network. Despite not being able to run or fight, C-3PO bravely stayed behind to hold back the First Order Agent Terex so that Poe Dameron and the spy droid N1-ZX could flee deeper into the caves.

C-3PO provided the talky with a new series of emergency communications, and the ancient droid complied, again recommending that another hybroid be prepared.

Dameron recovered and led Calrissian away, with Organa instructing C-3PO to continue.\\n\\nHowever, C-3PO revealed that he had successfully compiled the Trawak language based on the talky's messages, thus being able to encode further communications without its help. The talky was incredulous, believing no droid could reconstruct Trawak due to its complexity. C-3PO informed the talker droid that he was far more advanced than it and criticized its self-interest before thanking the talky for its service and deactivating it. With the talky powered down and Lobot having survived the ordeal, Organa ordered for the ancient droid to be placed in storage.\\n\\nCalrissian, concluding as a result of the incident that the Rebellion did not care for him or Lobot, decided to sell the talker droid, and thus the key to the rebels' new communications, to the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, to whom he owed a debt.

Lobot, entering the room to face the talker droid, managed to connect with the droid and reorganize its circuits, removing the corruption from within it.\\n\\nUpon awakening, the talker droid asked who the rebels were. C-3PO spoke with the ancient droid, informing it that it had awoken in the future and requesting that the linguistics droid prepared its Trawak language module for download. The droid refused, to C-3PO's surprise, not wishing to surrender the one reason that it had been brought back online. Interrupting C-3PO's outrage, Calrissian reminded the talker droid that it was functioning solely because of Lobot, who could undo what he had done to fix the droid.

Aware that the procedure would erase his memory, C-3PO decided to undergo it as he knew there was no other way to have a chance at defeating Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal. The protocol droid later regained his memory from a backup carried by R2-D2. Babu tinkered with C-3PO's main processing unit in order to locate the text of the inscription and override the programming preventing C-3PO from speaking the translation.

Obi-Wan told Skywalker that he did not remember much about his early life; he only knew that he left his homeworld at a young age, and was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant after being identified as Force-sensitive. Skywalker, having joined the Order at a much later time in his life than other Jedi, drew comparisons between his experience as a Padawan and that of his master, which in turn contributed to his insecurity and self-doubt.\\n\\nObi-Wan only retained vague memories of his biological family.

After communing with the Force spirit of Kenobi, Skywalker traveled to Dagobah, where he discovered Yoda, the ancient Grand Master of the Jedi Order. But Yoda was initially discouraged by Skywalker's attitude, seeing much of Anakin's impatience and anger in Luke. After some consideration and Kenobi's endorsement, Yoda chose to overlook Skywalker's age as well as his penchant for adventure and excitement in order to complete his training.\\n\\nSkywalker and Yoda were often at odds throughout their time together, with the latter trying to teach his apprentice to be calm and in control of his developing Jedi abilities.

By the time Luke returned to Dagobah to finish his Jedi training, Yoda had become ill and was on the verge of becoming one with the Force. Yoda told Skywalker that, while he required no further formal training, he had to confront his father one last time in order to finally become a true Jedi. Skywalker not only passed his final test, but also inspired Vader to turn away from the dark side, destroying the Sith and fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One.\\n\\nWith the Sith defeated, Luke Skywalker wandered the galaxy searching for knowledge that could help restore the Jedi Order. He trained his sister Leia Organa in the ways of the Force until she ceased her training to protect her son, Ben Solo, from the death she had foreseen would come if she continued down that path.

He and Luke immediately disliked each other: Solo found Luke irritating and overly eager, and his open disdain for Kenobi's beliefs and actions did little to change Luke's initial view of Solo as an extortionist. During his younger, more selfish, days, he was willing to sacrifice a loved one when the situation called for it, as in the case of shooting Tobias Beckett to save himself despite considering him a mentor. However, he came to change as he met Luke Skywalker and the Rebellion. After Han demonstrated his bravery on the Death Star and proved his loyalty, they became genuine friends, and soon after, Han became loyal to the Rebellion. Aside from his seemingly self-centered ways, Han was actually very loyal to his friends, and a good man. Having endured a difficult childhood as an impoverished orphan with no identity, Han instantly related to the Jakku scavenger Rey, who shared some of his skills.\\n\\nSolo enjoyed a good Rodian Splice, a drink typically ordered by, as described by the cook Strono Tuggs, \\\"desperate\\\" smugglers who wanted to prove something.

Han later met the thief Tobias Beckett and wound up joining his crew to steal unrefined coaxium from Kessel in order to pay a debt to Dryden Vos, a kingpin with the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate. By the end of this scheme, during which he reunited with Qi'ra, Han was forced to kill his mentor after a brutal double-cross. Han also became rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler Lando Calrissian and the Wookiee Chewbacca, the latter who became his best friend. Calrissian owned the Millennium Falcon, a fast ship with which Han made the Kessel Run in just twelve parsecs and won from Lando in a game of sabacc.\\n\\nWith only Chewbacca remaining at his side, as his trusted copilot who swore a life debt to the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo embarked on a smuggling career under the employ of Jabba the Hutt, a notorious gangster and crime lord of Tatooine. After ditching a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, Solo owed a great deal of money to Jabba, who then placed a bounty on the smuggler's head, as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when Han and Chewbacca were hired to charter Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Alderaan, avoiding Imperial stormtroopers who were searching for Luke's droids. \", \"However, he failed to live up to both his own and his parents' expectations. From adolescence, Dalven had dreamed of enrolling in the Imperial Academy in order to become somebody \\\"important\\\" despite his lack of interest in starships and piloting.

He regularly ridiculed Ciena for her poverty and her \\\"old-fashion ways.\\\" At the age of twelve, Dalven was once embarrassed when his younger brother was able to correctly identify the engine sounds of a Lambda-class shuttle. As an adult, Dalven was considered by his superior officer commander Windrider to be a weak and toadying man, who was capable of only fulfilling the basic tasks he had been given. Dalven's disdain for Ciena, who had become a captain in the Imperial Navy, led him to suggest that she was not worthy of the Distinguished Medal of Imperial Honor, one of the highest accolades in the Empire, which earned him rebuke from his superior officer, who had been a close friend to Ciena prior to her alleged death.\", \"Upon learning that commander Windrider had nominated his brother's childhood friend Ciena for the Distinguished Medal of Imperial Honor, Dalven suggested that the more common Medal of Honor would be more appropriate. Believing that Ciena had perished aboard the Star Destroyer Inflictor at Jakku, Nash pointed out that the captain had stayed behind to crash the ship onto the planet's surface in an effort to deny the Inflictor to the New Republic. When Dalven suggested that Windrider's nomination could be seen as a sign of factionalism since they had belonged in the same class, Windrider retorted that several prominent Imperial captains, generals, admirals, and officials including Grand Moff Randd were also planning to nominate her since she had purportedly died a hero's death.\\n\\nChastised by his commander, Dalven added that Ciena had died a \\\"terrible death.\\\" Windrider however disagreed with Dalven's remark and suggested that it was a glorious way to die for the Empire. He also expressed the hope of having such an opportunity. Dalven concurred before slinking away. Knowing that Dalven had ridiculed Ciena in his adolescence, Windrider toyed with the idea of finding an \\\"appropriate\\\" suicide mission for the clerical officer.

Han and Chewie headed there in a recently purchased high-end speeder, for which Han intended to bill the Alliance. The gang of bounty hunters they had run into previously followed them after interrogating Delia and threatening to kill her longtime friend. Unbeknownst to Han, Chewbacca and Ematt, the bounty hunters, realizing their situation for fighting the Empire earlier, agreed to help the Imperials by hunting down Han Solo and the rebel he was supposed to meet, with Alecia Beck having previously ambushed Ematt's team members of Taanab. Not intending to have Ematt commit suicide as his team members did to protect the sensitive information in their heads, Beck ordered over forty stormtroopers to take up positions in and around the hangar where the Falcon was berthed as the bounty hunters chased Han back towards his ship.\\n\\nArriving in the hanger to be surrounded by stormtroopers, Han and his compatriots believed they were done for. \", \"\\nUnlike his younger brother Thane, Dalven remained loyal to the Galactic Empire and did not defect to the Rebellion following the destruction of Alderaan.

They were unaware that Thane had become a starfighter pilot in the Rebel Alliance's Corona Squadron.

It took the Alliance Engineering Corps eighteen months to build, with two full months to install the equipment needed to make the base functional and survivable. It was protected from orbital bombardments by a massive shield generator  and a v-150 ion cannon, which would help the Alliance evacuate the base in case of an attack.\\n\\nOwing to slap-dash construction methods, a single faulty element in the base's electrical system could deny heat to half the base. Nevertheless, soldiers of the outpost were better equipped and displayed better discipline than those stationed elsewhere.

Rumors of a Rebel base, circulated throughout the Rebellion, though only a few in the Alliance actually knew concrete details of its existence. Rebel troopers at Echo Base, far-distanced from the disastrous Rebel tactical situation in the Mid and Outer Rim Territories, actually had access to better equipment and training than Rebel soldiers throughout the rest of the galaxy. The Empire began to intensify its search for the Rebel base after the ambush of a rebel convoy at Derra. As part of Project Swarm, the Empire sent Viper probe droids to search for the rebel base throughout the galaxy. Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra heavily set back the Empire's efforts to find Echo Base when, by hacking into Vader's armor while the Sith Lord was weakened in the Martyrium of Frozen Tears, she had numerous probe droid records deleted or altered. By her own estimate, as well as that of the Empire when it set out to untangle the mess she left them with, it would take weeks to recover the project's lost ground.\\n\\nShortly before the battle, a strategy conference was held at the base after the arrival of several transports arrived, which were rumored to carry Princess Leia Organa, General Carlist Rieekan, Commander Chiffonage, a Bothan spy, and several other members of Alliance Command. \", \"Following the evacuation from Yavin, The Alliance High Command met in the Alliance Fleet to discuss what actions to take next.

Though the Death Star was destroyed, the Rebels evacuated the Great Temple as the Empire still knew where the Alliance was housed. The initial search for a new base was conducted by General Jan Dodonna during the evacuation from Yavin 4. The Rebels eventually decided to establish their new base of operations on the ice planet Hoth in 1 ABY, with the Rebellion then spending the next two years building what became Echo Base. Over those two years, rebel engineers expanded ice caverns in a feat of engineering work. Once the area was finally carved and expanded, completing the base for use in 3 ABY, the Rebellion inhabited Echo Base for less than a month before the Empire discovered it.

They also attempted to set up base at Crait. In the subsequent three and a half years of conflict, General Jan Dodonna ordered a mission to find a base for the High Command, drawing up a list of potential planets, which included Hoth. During that mission, an Rebel Alliance Special Forces soldier named Purpruff traveled to the planet of Hoth in the Anoat sector and filed a report on it. Subsequently, the Corps of Engineers constructed the base over the course of two standard years, hoping to claim it as their new base of operations while avoiding the watchful eyes of the Empire. The base was inhabited for less than a month before the battle took place.\\n\\nFollowing the defeat of the Empire three and a half years earlier at the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance suffered from relentless Imperial attacks during the Mid Rim Retreat. \", \"\\nThe base was occupied by 7,500 combat personnel and 350 medical personnel, and contained a command center where the Rebel leadership coordinated Rebel activities, including the eventual evacuation from Hoth.

Hoth was continually pelted by meteors from its asteroid belt. Designed to be evacuated at a moment's notice, the base was hastily constructed, and often as not, wampa ice creatures would sneak into the base at night, forcing the closures of various corridors. Additionally, a specially reinforced chamber was constructed to hold multiple wampas. During the battle of Hoth, several snowtroopers ignored the sign and went into the room anyway, only to be slain by the icy creatures.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nEarly in the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance base made its home in the Great Temple on Yavin 4, the fourth moon of the planet Yavin.

The Skywalker twins developed a bond without knowing about their biological connection to each other.

It was rumored that he was an ex-slave, who had climbed out of the slave pits of Hutt Cartel gangster Jabba Desilijic Tiure; whatever the reason, Puhr harbored a hatred towards the crime lord, and refused to take bounties from his organization.\\n\\nPuhr was an associate of the smuggler Han Solo and his first mate Chewbacca. Puhr and Solo had an agreement whereby Solo would deliver him gwayo bird eggs, a delicacy of Puhr's homeworld, along with his regular cargo of spice for Jabba. During one of these shipments, Solo was forced to drop his spice cargo to avoid arrest by the Galactic Empire, causing Jabba to place a 50,000-credit bounty on his head and throwing the standing of his agreement with Puhr into question.\\n\\nIn 0 BBY, Puhr was present in the spaceport of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine.

He spent time at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in the spaceport of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine before accompanying Jabba to find the smuggler Han Solo in Docking Bay 94. Byrnloo and several other thugs began searching around Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon, but the smuggler arrived and offered to pay back the money he owed the Hutt. After haggling with Solo over interest on the debt, Jabba called off Byrnloo and the others, and they left the docking bay.\\n\\n## Biography\\n\\nA native of the planet Corellia, the human male Ront Byrnloo was a pirate and bounty hunter who served the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure as an enforcer. In the year 0 BBY, Byrnloo and two other human thugs were drinking at the bar of Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in the spaceport of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine when local moisture farmer Luke Skywalker and the hermit Obi-Wan Kenobi entered with the droids C-3PO and R2-D2.\\n\\nByrnloo and the two others then left the cantina and joined Jabba, three Rodians, and the bounty hunter Boba Fett in traveling to Docking Bay 94 in Mos Eisley, where the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon was docked. \", \"Byrnloo and the two others then left the cantina and joined Jabba, three Rodians, and the bounty hunter Boba Fett in traveling to Docking Bay 94 in Mos Eisley, where the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon was docked. The starship belonged to Han Solo, a smuggler who worked for Jabba but owed him money after dumping a shipment of the Hutt's spice in space upon encountering an Imperial ship. Byrnloo and his cohorts began searching around the ship as Jabba called out to Solo to come out and meet him.\\n\\nThe sisters Brea and Senni Tonnika, who were planning on stealing the Falcon, then sneaked in the back of the docking bay. Upon seeing Byrnloo and the other thugs with Jabba, the pair abandoned their plan and left to look for a different ship. Solo, who was not aboard the ship at all, then surprised Byrnloo and the others when he addressed Jabba from the entryway to the bay, having just arrived from the nearby cantina.\\n\\nThe Hutt chastised Solo for having not repaid him and for killing Greedo, another of his thugs, in the cantina. Solo then offered to repay the Hutt with interest using credits from a job he had just accepted from Kenobi. The two haggled over the interest amount that the smuggler would pay, settling on fifteen percent. Satisfied, Jabba called off his thugs, and Byrnloo and the others made their way out of the docking bay.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\n\", \"Following this, he left to celebrate in Chalmun's Cantina, only to be found by Solo, Chewbacca and an escaped prisoner named Phaedra. Upon being interrogated, Greedo told them the urn was stored in Tarkin's office on Coruscant and that the Falcon was in a docking bay in Mos Entha. Solo then punched Greedo and left him unconscious in the street as he and his crew left to retrieve the Falcon. Sometime later, Greedo was met by Tyra, who supplied him with burnt Ronto meat to pass off to Jabba as D'Naran's ashes. Despite Jabba's suspicions, the ploy worked and Greedo received the reward. He then met back up with Tyra, who told Greedo that he wanted to tie up loose ends since he still had a score to settle with Solo.\\n\\nGreedo was hunting Solo for the bounty Jabba placed on his head after the smuggler dropped a large shipment of illicit cargo owned by the Hutt to avoid Imperial arrest. A fellow Rodian bounty hunter named Neesh, who actually had been hired to kill Greedo before outsourcing the job to Spruch Goa, had encouraged Greedo to make a play at capturing Solo. Despite Neesh urging him to act alone when confronting Solo, Greedo hired Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba as backup.\\n\\nTo corner the smuggler, Greedo traveled to the Mos Eisley Cantina, where he also attempted to collect money owed to him by Bith musician Lirin Car'n. \", \"Greedo challenged Solo at the Mos Eisley Cantina, where, threatening Solo with his DT-12 heavy blaster pistol, he demanded that he pay the money to Jabba or to Greedo himself; or hand over Solo's legendary starship, the Millennium Falcon. When Solo replied that he would rather die than give up his ship, Greedo said that was indeed the idea before announcing that it was something he had been looking forward to for a long time. As Greedo pulled his trigger and said that he would end with him, Solo shot Greedo dead from beneath the table with his readily prepared blaster. Greedo missed Solo completely and the last thing that Greedo ever saw was a flash of bright light with a memory of bitter injustice. Greedo's body collapsed over the table, and his blood got over the surface.\\n\\nThe blaster shots and Greedo's death silenced the cantina for a brief moment as the various patrons turned to see Solo and the dead bounty hunter, with Solo getting up to leave immediately after as if nothing important had happened. As he left, he threw a few credits to Wuher to apologize for the mess. While his mind was more interested on Kenobi's display with the lightsaber, Wuher dragged Greedo's body out of the building and cleaned up the Rodian's blood. Cantina patron Ohwun De Maal later gave a statement on the incident and noted Greedo had unholstered his blaster.\\n\\n\", \"\\nAround this time, he was hired by Myo to retrieve a valuable kloo horn, which the Abyssin had won in a card game from Lirin Car'n the night before before becoming intoxicated and losing it himself. Car'n, a member of the Modal Nodes house band , desperately needed money to pay off a debt to Rodian bounty hunter Greedo. With this in mind, Lirin Car'n also hired Puhr for the same task, promising to pay two hundred credits to retrieve it.\\n\\nThe Sakiyan bounty hunter easily found the horn\\u2014which had been stolen by Muftak and Kabe and sold in order to pay their rent\\u2014and acquired it from the Scrapper. After a brief confrontation with Han Solo and Chewbacca , he returned to his regular table. In the course of the heated conversation between his companions, it became clear that the group's various problems stemmed from the smuggler Solo's failure to deliver his cargo of narcotics to Muftak. Knowing that Greedo planned to collect on Solo's bounty that same day, Puhr made a wager on the smuggler's life, promising to \\\"pay off\\\" the group's various debts himself, should Solo live.\\n\\nAfter his henchmen, Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba, were incapacitated by a third party, Greedo's attempt failed, and he was killed by Solo. Puhr, content with the outcome of the situation and the justice of the universe, produced Car'n's kloo horn\\u2014in doing so defusing the situation and effectively paying off the \\\"debts\\\" of his friends.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\n\", \"\\nExploiting his species' keen senses and quick reflexes, Djas Puhr was a skilled tracker\\u2014effortlessly retrieving Lirin D'avi's kloo horn from a Scrapper for his friend Lirin Car'n. As a bounty hunter, Puhr considered himself a professional and carefully analyzed the situations he found himself in; when he wished to do so, he would even wager on the outcome, sometimes just to consider the philosophy behind it.\\n\\nThough Puhr retained some sentimentality when remembering his homeworld, he was generally reluctant to have close relationships with others, even his drinking partners at Chalmun's Cantina. He felt that, in his line of work, personal attachment was dangerous, if not impossible. Nevertheless, Puhr found the concept of friendship intriguing, and considered Han Solo's gwayo egg smuggling as a foolhardy but admirable and thoughtful gesture.\\n\\nDespite his work on Tatooine, Puhr hated Jabba Desilijic Tiure with a passion and refused to take bounties from him, holding other hunters that did so, like Greedo, in contempt. He also disliked the Empire and likened the Imperial Navy to a \\\"refuse fleet.\\\"\", \"\\nGreedo's death angered a group of fellow Rodians based on Tatooine, who saw Greedo as a brother Rodian and thus wanted revenge on Solo. The masked Sana Starros met with the Rodians to learn Solo had departed the planet by that point. In the end, Greedo had never established the legacy for himself he hoped to earn. The successful jobs he did carry out were regarded as mid-level affairs and were forgotten with time. As reasoned by the pirate Hondo Ohnaka, Greedo was likely more famous for his death at the hands of Solo than anything the bounty hunter did in his life.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\nAs a boy, Greedo was noted for his temper and tendency to pick fights with others, which his friend, Wald warned would lead to trouble. In adulthood, Greedo was overconfident and slow on the uptake, and something of a poor shot with a blaster. He thought highly of himself as a \\\"big time\\\" bounty hunter due to his employment to Jabba the Hutt, even believing himself more prestigious than Boba Fett, though others saw him as unremarkable.\\n\\nHe was a frequent customer of Chalmun's Cantina, considering it his base of operations and preferred venue for death deals.

The Jedi poured their Living Force presence into the Cosmic Force, allowing them to create a simulacrum of themselves and small objects over distances of several light-years. It was also possible to project several simulacra at the same time in the immediate vicinity of the caster.\\n\\nUsing this power was extremely taxing; Kylo Ren noted that Rey, whose power in the Force rivaled his own immense powers as a Skywalker, would die just by trying. Although Luke Skywalker maintained a projection for several minutes, giving all of himself to the Force to allow him to physically interact with his surroundings, the strain cost him his life.\\n\\nThe simulacrum, being only a projection, allowed one to appear to perform seemingly impossible feats, such as being unscathed after taking a barrage of blaster bolts, stabbed at with a weapon, or disappearing from one position and reappearing in another. It also allowed one to project something other than one's true physical appearance, such as making oneself appear younger, or appearing to have an object not currently in one's possession. \", \"As they fought on the wreckage of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, Ren's mother, General Leia Organa, died reaching out to her son in the Force.

Meanwhile, Rey resolved to confront and destroy her grandfather, Sidious, on the dark world of Exegol.\\n\\nWhile the Resistance and its allies engaged the Sith Eternal forces in the Battle of Exegol, Solo and Rey confronted Sidious in the heart of his citadel. Having failed to take Rey as his new vessel, Sidious resolved to destroy them both, but in the process he discovered that their bond was as powerful as life itself. Realizing that they were a Force dyad, Sidious decided to remain in his clone body and have it healed instead by nearly draining their combined life force in order to do so. Yet his triumphant return was short-lived; calling on the spirits of all the past Jedi, Rey was able to vanquish her grandfather at the cost of her life. When Solo found Rey's body, he sacrificed himself to bring her back to life.

However, Ren also had a vision of his own, one where he saw Rey standing by his side.\\n\\nRey's confrontation with Snoke led to her brutal interrogation by way of the Supreme Leader's Force powers, and as a result the location of Luke Skywalker's hermitage was successfully probed from her mind. Snoke, who intended to kill the last Jedi after dealing with the more immediate threat of the Resistance, held Rey in stasis and commanded Ren to kill her, exclaiming that this act would be the fulfillment of his dark destiny. Ren's emotions were even further churned up by the bond between himself and Rey, but his newfound resolve and clarity reassured Snoke that his oft-conflicted apprentice would not give into sentiment again. In the end, Snoke's visions and Force senses failed him for he did not see his end at the hands of his own disciple.

However, an inquisitive porg began to search through her belongings and snatched it, attempting to escape with into the ocean with it before Rey used the Force to pull the fleeing bird back to her and retrieve the weapon. The incident was a teaching moment for Rey, who had been able to focus on the power of telekinesis to retrieve the porg.\\n\\nAfter a fateful connection with Kylo Ren, Rey attacked Luke with her quarterstaff, demanding to know the truth of what transpired between the Jedi Master and his apprentice, Ben Solo, on the night of the Jedi temple's destruction. When Luke disarmed Rey of her melee weapon, she summoned the Skywalker lightsaber through telekinesis. Luke gave ground when Rey moved into an attack position, and the scavenger lowered the lightsaber while still demanding to hear the truth. After his confession, Rey offered Luke his old lightsaber once more, entreating him for the last time to join the fight against the First Order.\\n\\nDisillusioned by Luke's inaction, Rey departed from Ahch-To without him. She kept the Skywalker lightsaber and brought it with her to the Supremacy, flagship of Supreme Leader Snoke, where she confronted Kylo Ren in person. He ordered Rey to surrender the lightsaber to him upon seeing it in her hands, stating that it belonged to him. \", \"At this point, they discovered their ability to see, hear and touch each other through the Force.

Convinced that the light side still existed within the former Ben Solo, Rey chose to confront Ren in person, believing she could help him turn away from the dark side of the Force.\\n\\nRen's master, Supreme Leader Snoke, was aware of his apprentice's connection to a certain entity in the light, knowing that Ren's growing strength with the dark side meant that his equal would rise in the light. He assumed it would be Luke Skywalker, Ren's previous mentor, until he discovered Rey after her awakening in the Force. Snoke gloated in his success at having gathered Rey and Ren before him, for it proved beyond a doubt that there existed a unique bond between them. Using Snoke's reliance on sensing his every thought, Ren outmaneuvered his mentor and ultimately killed him. With Snoke's unexpected death, the Elite Praetorian Guards did all they could to stop their leader's assassin, causing Ren and Rey to fight alongside each other. Their bond grew even more powerful in combat, amplifying the powers of the two.\\n\\n\", \"Following her confrontation against Ren and the revelation that the resurrected Darth Sidious was her grandfather, fearing that she would fall to the dark side of the Force, Rey fled to Ahch-To and intended to live out the rest of her days there in self-imposed exile as Skywalker had previously done. During her exile, Rey destroyed Kylo Ren's TIE whisper, burning it on the shores of Ahch-To, where she also planned to throw her saber into, but was caught by the Force spirit of Luke Skywalker, who gave it back to her, reminding her of the respect the weapon deserved. Rey then took the lightsaber, along with Leia's lightsaber, to Exegol in his old X-wing.\\n\\nAfter using Vader's wayfinder, Rey and Sidious confronted each other during the Battle of Exegol. His spirit confined to an imperfect clone of his original body, the fallen Emperor urged his granddaughter to kill him with her Jedi lightsaber, taking his place on the Throne of the Sith as \\\"Empress Palpatine.\\\" This would ensure the Sith Lord's essence's transferal to Rey, which will allow him to possess her body, thus renewing the Sith Eternal for the reign of a new Sith Empire.

In 34 ABY, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker projected his appearance from Ahch-To to Crait, where he confronted his nephew, Kylo Ren, during the Battle of Crait. The feat was so strenuous that it led to Skywalker's death, after which he became one with the Force. He carried a copy of Han Solo's dice with him that he left with General Leia Organa, who left them at the old Rebel base on the planet. Ren discovered the dice, which disappeared shortly after Skywalker's death.\\n\\nSkywalker's ability to project himself became known in the wider galaxy after his death, so the story of his stand against tyranny spread hope as the First Order invaded.

They were physically two separate individuals, but they were one in the Force. This form of connection made it possible for the bonded individuals to communicate with each other across great distances.\\n\\nA Force dyad, binding two separate beings together, was not an easily discernible phenomenon. The Sith Lord Darth Sidious was unaware that Ben Solo and Rey were a dyad until he inadvertently siphoned a fraction of their bond's life force. Supreme Leader Snoke, the dark side master of Solo's alter ego, Kylo Ren, was aware that his apprentice had an equal in the light side of the Force. However, he incorrectly presumed that it was Solo's uncle, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, before realizing that it was, in fact, a scavenger girl from Jakku.\\n\\nAccording to Darth Sidious, the Force dyad was a power like life itself; and the members of a dyad possessed many unique Force powers that were otherwise inaccessible to even the most powerful Force wielder who lacked the dyadic relationship. He believed that if two Sith were bonded so deeply as to transcend their physical beings, the power they could unlock together would know no limits.\\n\\nThe beings who formed a dyad in the Force possessed the uncommon power of Force healing. \", \"\\nRen pulled the lightsaber forward with the Force; as it levitated into Rey's hand, the upper half of Snoke's body fell to the floor while the lower half remained seated on his throne. Armed with their lightsabers, they fought together to defeat the Elite Praetorian Guards. When all but one of the guards were slain, Rey threw the Skywalker lightsaber to Ren, who killed the final sentry by igniting the plasma blade through the Praetorian's face-plate.\\n\\nAfter the battle, Ren offered Rey a place at his side as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, which she refused and attempted to take her lightsaber back by way of the Force. The two simultaneously pulled at the weapon, trapping it between them as they expended powerful Force energy to reclaim it. The strain eventually caused the kyber crystal within to crack and release a surge of energy that knocked the two combatants back, rendering Ren unconscious and sundering the lightsaber in half.

As a first step, Yoda acquired a kyber crystal from the icy caverns of Ilum, a mission that proved to be very eventful.\\n\\nThe lightsaber was put to good use on Geonosis, when Yoda was forced to confront his former apprentice Count Dooku while the first battle of the Clone Wars was being fought outside.\\n\\nIn the years of the Clone Wars, the green-bladed saber served its master well on multiple occasions. However, Yoda eventually lost his weapon when he dueled the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious in the Senate Building. When Sidious unleashed bolts of energy to disarm him, the Jedi Master lost his lightsaber, which fell to the ground below.\\n\\nWith that, Yoda lost the lightsaber he had treasured.

These lightsabers were burned as part of the public demonstration, and their kyber crystals caused a large explosion of energy during the gathering.\\n\\nSubsequently, Yoda didn't want to wield another lightsaber. However, he kept another lightsaber in a box in his hut in 3 ABY. After Yoda's death in 4 ABY, that lightsaber ended up in the possession of Yoda's last Jedi apprentice, Luke Skywalker.\", \"Although the planet's fauna, weather patterns, and non-existence on standard astrogation charts made it an ideal place to hide, Yoda lived in exile there for a deeper purpose than to live a life of hardship or to hide from the fledgling Galactic Empire. Without distractions or any means of leaving the world to confront the Sith on his own, Yoda was allowed to ponder ancient Jedi texts, meditate on the deepest mysteries of the Force, and communicate with other Jedi such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ezra Bridger. Patiently waiting until he would be called to help the children of Anakin Skywalker to restore balance to the Force as well as the Jedi Order to maintain it, Yoda lived a modest existence, meditating and studying Dagobah's strength in the Living Force whilst also monitoring the Skywalker twins.\\n\\nThe energy of all life, the Living Force was particularly affected by sentient beings. Feeling emotions and capable of intelligence, sentients' actions echoed deeply in the Living Force throughout galactic history. Qui-Gon Jinn was a student of the Living Force, and stressed its importance to his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, telling him that being mindful of the Living Force required him to keep his concentration on the here and now, rather than letting anxieties about the future come at the expense of the present moment. \", \"As the Clone Wars progressed, Yoda decided to alleviate Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker's fear and inability to lose loved ones by assigning him a Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano. He believed that by becoming a teacher, Skywalker would develop emotionally and that when the time came for Tano to go off on her own, he would understand that his excessive bonding to those he cared about was unnecessary. Tano traveled to the planet of Christophsis, where she presented herself to Skywalker in the midst of a battle against Confederate forces.\\n\\nAfter the battle had concluded, Yoda, himself, arrived on the planet and assigned the duo to the task of finding Rotta, the son of influential Hutt crime lord Jabba, who had been kidnapped as part of a plan arranged by his uncle Ziro to alienate the Hutts and the Jedi and drag the former into war.

Despite her young age, the child proved to be wise, and Tano was upset that Fardi would likely never be able to prove her wisdom to Yoda. Later, while sleeping aboard the CR90 corvette Tantive IV after Organa offered her a chance to join his rebellion, Tano remembered Yoda's advice to her when she was getting her first kyber crystal. Awaking and knowing she should make a new set of lightsabers, she thanked Yoda, even though she knew he could not possibly hear or help her.\\n\\nDuring his exile on Dagobah, Yoda kept an eye on other Jedi throughout the galaxy, including those who ventured into the various Jedi Temples found amongst the stars. Approximately four years before the Battle of Yavin, Yoda spoke to Kanan Jarrus, who had been the Padawan of Depa Billaba and a survivor of Order 66.

With an unusually high concentration of the Living Force coursing across Dagobah, the planet allowed for even the most powerful Force users to camouflage themselves within its echoes. Verdant swamps and jungles on the world formed wellsprings of the Living Force\\u2014eddies, whirlpools, and springs in the cosmic flow of the Force that came and went with it.

Having been expelled from the Order prior to her trial, Tano was offered a promotion to the rank of Knight, but rejected it and chose to leave the Order for good.\\n\\nTano spent a period of time wandering the city planet of Coruscant, acquiring a junky Joben T-85 speeder bike. Eventually, the bike malfunctioned as she was entering an underworld portal, sending her plummeting all the way down to Level 1313, where she made a crash landing on the landing platform of a repair shop owned by Trace Martez. Tano quickly befriended Trace, but her older sister Rafa Martez, a cynical gambler, remained suspicious of her and her motives, feeling she might be using her somehow. After helping Trace chase down a rampaging Type II loadlifter droid that Rafa had been hired to build, Tano was invited to stick around for as long as she needed to, an offer she eventually accepted when Trace asked her to help test her self-assembled starship, the Silver Angel. Choosing to keep her past secret from the sisters, Tano fudged the truth when asked where she was from and how she had learned things like how to fight and where she had worked on starships, and avoided using her Force powers where they would be noticeable.\\n\\n\", \"However, after being framed for treason by her former friend Barriss Offee, leading to her trial and near-execution, Tano lost faith in the Order and left, leaving her weapons behind. Late in the war, after joining up with Mandalorian warrior Bo-Katan Kryze and her Nite Owls, Tano received her lightsabers back from her former master Anakin Skywalker upon temporarily rejoining the Republic military to lead forces in the Siege of Mandalore. After winning the Siege and capturing the renegade Sith Lord Maul, Tano and Clone Commander Rex's journey back to Coruscant with their prisoner was disrupted by Darth Sidious' issuance of Order 66, which initiated the Great Jedi Purge. After freeing Maul as a distraction for the attacking clone troopers, Tano ambushed Rex and had his control chip removed. However, Maul's subsequent destruction of the hyperdrive of the Tribunal, the Venator-class Star Destroyer they were traveling on, caused the stricken starship to crash on a moon, with only Tano, Rex and Maul making it off beforehand. Afterwards, Tano abandoned her lightsabers by the graves she and Rex had dug for the clones who died in the crash to fake her death, before she and Rex parted ways to go into hiding.\\n\\nTano spent the next year in hiding on the planet Thabeska, working as a mechanic for the Fardi clan. After fleeing the planet on the first Empire Day, Tano, under the alias \\\"Ashla,\\\" wound up on the remote farming moon Raada. \", \"Tano eventually gave the sisters an opportunity to escape by claiming to want to cut a deal with Krim by herself, asserting that the sisters had hidden the spice offworld and giving them the opportunity to retrieve it, with the threat of retaliation against their family if they failed, Krim being unaware that the sisters had no living relatives. Rafa, touched at the gesture, came up with a plan to steal spice from the Pykes' loading docks to give to the Pykes so they could free Tano. Meanwhile, attempting to escape from their stronghold and destroy their spice refining facility, Tano discovered that the Pykes were working for the Sith Lord Darth Maul. When Tano was recaptured again, Krim and Fife discovered she was a Force-user and assumed she was on an undercover mission for the Jedi and Galactic Republic. When the sisters came back for her, the three were able to escape Oba Diah again, although the truth of Tano's past was revealed to the Martezes. Tano believed that the sisters were safe from retaliation due to her apparent status as a Republic operative. However, after returning to Coruscant, Tano was immediately recruited by Kryze, who had followed them from the Outer Rim, to help deal with Maul.\\n\\n## Prelude\\n\\nAhsoka Tano, appointed as the Padawan of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker early in the Clone Wars, became disillusioned with the Jedi Order after being framed for treason by her former friend and fellow Padawan Barriss Offee. \", \"The two would often butt heads, each believing that they knew better than the other. During their first mission together at the Battle of Christophsis, they developed demeaning nicknames for each other; Tano gave her master the diminutive title \\\"Skyguy,\\\" while Skywalker returned the favor with the name \\\"Snips,\\\" referring to Tano's snippy wit. Tano used the nickname Skyguy only because it annoyed Skywalker, although, as the war progressed, these nicknames would remain by changing into more playful terms of friendship. Skywalker also quickly came to respect Tano's bravery and determination, and he recognized that Tano was just as reckless as him.\\n\\nFor all their bickering, the two developed a close relationship during the Clone Wars. Skywalker reassured his Padawan that their meeting was no accident and that it was the will of the Force for her to train under him. Their rapport made it's way onto the battlefield, with the duo competing to see who could destroy the most droids during the Second Battle of Geonosis. The master and apprentice grew increasingly reliant on each other throughout the war, taking turns rescuing each other from Separatist forces and bounty hunters. After situations where she was nearly killed, she found that she could talk to her mentor to come to terms with it. Tano's naive outlook balanced with Skywalker's cynical approach. During her time on Mortis, Tano was killed by the Son and only resurrected after Skywalker pleaded with the Father to help save her. \", \"\\nAt some point later, Tano flew a TIE fighter that had been repainted by Wren after it was stolen by the Spectres during a \\\"meiloorun run\\\" gone wrong.\\n\\nAfter the crew of the Ghost joined the Phoenix Squadron, Ahsoka Tano acted as a mentor and adviser to the newer rebels. She had a particular affinity with Kanan and his apprentice Ezra Bridger, fellow Jedi who were resisting the Empire. On one occasion, Tano and Bridger traveled to a planet where Bridger was practicing his lightsaber form. While Bridger practiced, Tano startled Bridger and asked him where he got his weapon. Bridger explained the origin of his weapon and handed it to Tano. With the weapon, Tano took out the kyber crystal and asked Bridger how he felt to be one of the only ones in the galaxy with a lightsaber. With his response not satisfying her, she decided to teach Bridger a lesson and tossed the crystal into a nearby field. Exasperated, Bridger was tossed back his weapon as Tano activated one of her own. Tano began to swing her lightsaber at Bridger who believed he had no way to defend himself as he questioned her motives. As Tano continued to attack Bridger, she let him focus on the Force to evade her, while simultaneously searching for where his crystal had landed. As he evaded, Bridger eventually discovered his crystal and activated his lightsaber to stop Tano's oncoming blade. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.8669075132506985, "reason": "The actual output aligns with the expected output in terms of facts and opinions, includes citations in the correct format, and provides sufficient detail without being vague.

The planet of Felucia hosted many translucent life-forms that colored the sunlight as its beams penetrated their skin. Blue, green, red, and yellow are examples of colors.\\n\\n## In technology\\n\\nThe color of a Jedi lightsaber's blade was defined by its kyber crystal, which was harvested from the Crystal Cave on Ilum. A lightsaber crystal was colorless until it was found by a Jedi youngling, where the youngling would then become attuned to the crystal and the crystal would display its color. The color being determined by the youngling's \\\"spiritual alignment.\\\" A Jedi's lightsaber blade was usually green or blue, but other colors were possible, such as Mace Windu's purple-bladed lightsaber. The Sith often wielded red lightsabers due to a process known as bleeding, where the user used the dark side of the Force to bend a kyber crystal to their will. Additionally Jedi can use the Force to heal them of the dark side presence, causing them to turn white.\\n\\nSpecialized B1-series battle droids were distinguished by colored markings on their armor. Blue denoted pilot droids, red denoted security droids, and yellow denoted command droids.\\n\\n## In culture\\n\\nIn the galaxy, colors were often culturally significant. For example, the color red was associated with diplomatic immunity under the Galactic Republic, warning others not to attack. \", \"# Yoda's lightsaber\\n\\n## Characteristics\\n\\nYoda's lightsaber smaller size was a unique quality matching its wielder's small stature. The weapon had a simple design, consisting of a studded chrome handle with black trim and an emitter shroud. It contained a kyber crystal that put forth a bright green plasma blade.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nLike many Jedi did for hundreds of years, Yoda built his lightsaber under the aegis of Professor Huyang, an architect droid who had been with the Jedi Order since its nascent days. As a first step, Yoda acquired a kyber crystal from the icy caverns of Ilum, a mission that proved to be very eventful.\\n\\nThe lightsaber was put to good use on Geonosis, when Yoda was forced to confront his former apprentice Count Dooku while the first battle of the Clone Wars was being fought outside.\\n\\nIn the years of the Clone Wars, the green-bladed saber served its master well on multiple occasions. However, Yoda eventually lost his weapon when he dueled the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious in the Senate Building. When Sidious unleashed bolts of energy to disarm him, the Jedi Master lost his lightsaber, which fell to the ground below.\\n\\nWith that, Yoda lost the lightsaber he had treasured. After the rise of the new Galactic Empire, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda spoke to a gathering of citizens on Coruscant about the end of the Jedi Order and the freedoms that the Empire would bring to the galaxy without the Jedi. \", \"# Yoda's second lightsaber\\n\\nYoda kept a second lightsaber, which he previously built as a backup blade, on Dagobah inside his hut in 3 ABY after his previous one was lost during a duel in the Galactic Senate against Darth Sidious and then incinerated during a celebration of the Jedi Order's eradication in 19 BBY.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker eventually had the lightsaber in his possession after Yoda's death in 4 ABY. Five years later, he offered the weapon to Grogu in a choice against obtaining beskar armor. However, Grogu chose the beskar armor over the lightsaber and went back to Din Djarin.\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nThe lightsaber was a single-bladed shoto consisting of a short blade length, a straight and cylindrical hilt shape, an emitter shroud, and was powered by a green kyber crystal.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nThe Jedi Grand Master Yoda had at least two lightsabers. In 3 ABY, Yoda stored one of his lightsabers in a box alongside keepsakes and ancient texts in his hut on the Outer Rim planet Dagobah after the specific lightsaber he had treasured was lost during a duel in the Galactic Senate against the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious. Sidious wanted to keep Yoda's initial lightsaber as a trophy in the Imperial Palace, however, it was incinerated during a celebration of the Jedi Order's eradication on the Imperial capital, Coruscant, by Grand Vizier Mas Amedda in 19 BBY. Yoda in his self-imposed exile, decided not to wield a lightsaber anymore.\\n\\n\", \"After Vader did so, Sidious shocked his apprentice with bolts of Force lightning. Sidious then ignited his lightsaber and threatened that if Vader touched him with the Force again, he would finish what Obi-Wan could not.\\n\\nAfter Vader tracked down Jedi Master Kirak Infil'a and took his lightsaber, claiming the kyber crystal. Palpatine sent him to a Sith cave which was all that remained of the Sith temple on Mustafar so he could corrupt it with his pain and anger in order to make it \\\"bleed.\\\" Inside the cave, Vader's first attempt resulted in him experiencing an intense light side Force visions that urged him to return to the light side. He experienced a vision where he reassembled the lightsaber and returned to Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant with it in its green color. Realizing Vader did not embraced the dark side, Palpatine attacked his apprentice but the cyborg killed him in the vision and reconciled with Kenobi.\\n\\nLater after Vader bled his third kyber crystal, Palpatine sought to teach him a lesson with a sparring duel on the Works which was the first headquarters of them and the former\\u2019s new Inquisitorius. Igniting his remaining lightsaber, Palpatine charged at Vader and quickly overwhelming his apprentice who told him lightsabers were not the real tool of the Sith but the dark side of the Force was. \", \"After the rise of the new Galactic Empire, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda spoke to a gathering of citizens on Coruscant about the end of the Jedi Order and the freedoms that the Empire would bring to the galaxy without the Jedi. He had a collection of lightsabers from fallen Jedi, including Yoda's lightsaber. These lightsabers were burned as part of the public demonstration, and their kyber crystals caused a large explosion of energy during the gathering.\\n\\nSubsequently, Yoda didn't want to wield another lightsaber. However, he kept another lightsaber in a box in his hut in 3 ABY. After Yoda's death in 4 ABY, that lightsaber ended up in the possession of Yoda's last Jedi apprentice, Luke Skywalker.\", \"As such, the Council ordered Jedi to only construct battle sabers, hilts with a simple design like those seen in the late Republic Era. Even then, Jedi active in the later High Republic Era still had a wider variance in lightsaber color than the blue and green-filled Order of the late Republic. While each individual Jedi built their own lightsaber as a youngling to their own specifications, allowing for a degree of individuality in hilt design even during the late Republic Era, groupings of Jedi of that time were largely defined by cylindrical silver hilts of an overall similar design, with those hilts mainly producing green or blue blades.\\n\\nDuring the High Republic Era, when the young boy Lohim Nara spoke to Grand Master Yoda about his life-long desire to join the Order, he confessed that he had faked his Force-sensitivity and midi-chlorian count, but Yoda told the boy of how the Force was not the sole answer to what a Jedi was. Yoda spoke of how the Force existed in all life forms and how, if he wanted to be someone worthy of the name Jedi, he could not dwell on what he did not have. He also told the boy not to worry about being \\\"too old\\\" to become a youngling, stating that he was still learning at over six hundred years old. \", \"For example, the color red was associated with diplomatic immunity under the Galactic Republic, warning others not to attack. As the color of ambassadorial relations and neutrality under the Republic, a completely red color scheme such as that of the Consular-class space cruiser Radiant VII indicated a ship came from the capital world of Coruscant. As the personal favorite color of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, red was co-opted during his chancellery and assigned across Republic vessels at his direction. Dark red was also the main color scheme on Republic ships and vehicles during the Clone Wars, whereas the Separatist ships and vehicles largely used dark blue. However, the color red was sometimes regarded as intense and aggressive. For that reason, the Sith wielded red lightsaber blades that represented their destructive view of the Force. Nevertheless, the members of many Force-worshipping sects native to Jedha donned scarlet vestments.\\n\\nLikewise, the white color of clone trooper armor signified an honorable symbol of defense before becoming skewed into one of a faceless icon of conformity under the Galactic Empire. During the Clone Wars, the clone troopers were referred to as \\\"the boys in white.\\\" In the days of the Old Republic, silver was used as a status symbol for royalty, as residents of Naboo used chromium to cover their starfighters and cruisers.\\n\\nAll languages combined, there existed forty billion, eleven million, seven hundred forty-two thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three accepted synonyms for the color blue. \", \"While the phrase \\\"this weapon is your life\\\" was popular during the late Republic Era, a Jedi\\u2014as exemplified by the High Republic Era and Kenobi's speech\\u2014needed to be more than their lightsaber. Indeed, after the Order's fall, Luke Skywalker came to realize that a Jedi was not their lightsaber and instead the duty he was tasked with was something beyond a single weapon. Faced with either needing to rescue his friend Leia Organa or continue looking for his lightsaber on Cloud City, Skywalker came to his decision and left to help his friend.\\n\\nThe High Republic Era would also see a greater variance in lightsaber color and hilt design than the Jedi of the late Republic. During the late Republic era, Jedi largely wielded blue or green lightsabers with simple silver hilts. A shift in lightsaber design could be seen in the High Republic Era: the Nihil conflict saw the Jedi Order implement the Guardian Protocols and prepare for greater conflict, during which the High Council knew Jedi could lose their blade and be forced to quickly replace it. Rather than have Jedi spend time building elaborated hilts, the Council reasoned that speed and effectiveness was of the essence and that a ready supply of lightsabers was something the Order needed. As such, the Council ordered Jedi to only construct battle sabers, hilts with a simple design like those seen in the late Republic Era. \", \"\\nAfter Yoda's death in 4 ABY, the lightsaber with its accompanying storage box ended up in the possession of Yoda's last Jedi apprentice, Luke Skywalker. In 9 ABY, Skywalker offered the saber to Grogu\\u2014a young member of Yoda's species\\u2014who was being trained by Skywalker at his Jedi academy on the Outer Rim planet Ossus. Grogu had to make a choice, choose the lightsaber and continue on the Jedi path or choose the beskar armor made for him at the request of his Mandalorian mentor Din Djarin and surrender to the bond he had with him, renouncing the Jedi.

Soldiers in the field complained that it attempted to manage the Rebellion as a government, and not a military resistance.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nIn the early days of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire, various rebel cells began coordinating their efforts to combat the reign of the Empire.

It was from there that the Alliance launched their assault on the planet Scarif and saw the acquisition of the technical data to the Galactic Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star.\\n\\nFollowing the evacuation from Yavin, The Alliance High Command met in the Alliance Fleet to discuss what actions to take next. \", \"# Echo Base\\n\\nEcho Base was the facility established by the Rebel Alliance on the frigid planet of Hoth in the wake of the Battle of Yavin, so named due to its strange acoustics. Within a month of its establishment, the base was discovered by the Galactic Empire, which quickly invaded Hoth, forcing the Rebels to evacuate.\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nThe den of a wampa clan before the arrival of the Rebel Alliance, Echo Base was carved out of a glacier and connected by artificial corridors linked together with structural supports, while natural caverns were expanded to suit the Alliance's needs. It took the Alliance Engineering Corps eighteen months to build, with two full months to install the equipment needed to make the base functional and survivable. It was protected from orbital bombardments by a massive shield generator  and a v-150 ion cannon, which would help the Alliance evacuate the base in case of an attack.\\n\\nOwing to slap-dash construction methods, a single faulty element in the base's electrical system could deny heat to half the base. Nevertheless, soldiers of the outpost were better equipped and displayed better discipline than those stationed elsewhere. In its cavernous ice hangars, the base hosted a contingent of speeders, which were specially modified to operate in the harsh conditions and which the Rebels used for patrol and defense of the outpost. \", \"# Echo Station 3-T-8\\n\\nEcho Station 3-T-8 was a Rebel Alliance scout post outside Echo Base on the icy planet Hoth. Prior to the Battle of Hoth, scouts at the Echo Station were the first to spot approaching Imperial forces. After sighting Imperial AT-ATs on the north ridge, the station officer relayed the message to the rest of Echo Base. The post, which was garrisoned by multiple Rebel troops and turrets, was quickly overwhelmed by the advancing Imperial forces.\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nLocated on the frozen, barren planet Hoth, Echo Station 3-T-8 was composed of trenches dug out along the North Ridge near Echo Base. The station was used for scouting purposes, and it was occupied by several Rebel troops and turrets.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nEarly in the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance base made its home in the Great Temple on Yavin 4. The Empire tracked the Rebels to Yavin 4 and attempted to destroy the moon with the Death Star, a superweapon capable of destroying planets. During the ensuing battle, Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker successfully destroyed the space station. Although the Death Star was destroyed, Rebel forces evacuated, as the Empire knew their location.\\n\\nFollowing the evacuation of Yavin, General Jan Dodonna initiated a search for a new base, and within three years Echo Base was constructed on Hoth, accompanied by a v-150 ion cannon and several outposts, such as Echo Station 3-T-8.\\n\\n\", \"# Unidentified wampa's clan\\n\\nA Wampa clan lived on the planet Hoth around three years after the Battle of Yavin. Prior to the Battle of Hoth, the clan lived in what would eventually become the Rebel Alliance's Echo Base.

The patriarch lost his arm to Skywalker but recovered and began to adjust over the next few days, eventually making his way back to Echo Base and reclaiming the now-vacant caverns in the wake of the Battle of Hoth. With his home reclaimed, the wampa intended to reunite his clan.\", \"Following the defeat of the Empire three and a half years earlier at the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance suffered from relentless Imperial attacks during the Mid Rim Retreat. Rumors of a Rebel base, circulated throughout the Rebellion, though only a few in the Alliance actually knew concrete details of its existence. Rebel troopers at Echo Base, far-distanced from the disastrous Rebel tactical situation in the Mid and Outer Rim Territories, actually had access to better equipment and training than Rebel soldiers throughout the rest of the galaxy. The Empire began to intensify its search for the Rebel base after the ambush of a rebel convoy at Derra. As part of Project Swarm, the Empire sent Viper probe droids to search for the rebel base throughout the galaxy. Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra heavily set back the Empire's efforts to find Echo Base when, by hacking into Vader's armor while the Sith Lord was weakened in the Martyrium of Frozen Tears, she had numerous probe droid records deleted or altered. By her own estimate, as well as that of the Empire when it set out to untangle the mess she left them with, it would take weeks to recover the project's lost ground.\\n\\nShortly before the battle, a strategy conference was held at the base after the arrival of several transports arrived, which were rumored to carry Princess Leia Organa, General Carlist Rieekan, Commander Chiffonage, a Bothan spy, and several other members of Alliance Command. \", \"Following the evacuation from Yavin, The Alliance High Command met in the Alliance Fleet to discuss what actions to take next.

Admiral Gial Ackbar told the princess that they could not maintain such an offensive due to still being on the run.\\n\\nFour years after the Battle of Yavin, the High Command had transferred their headquarters to Admiral Ackbar's flagship Home One.

The Alliance High Command eventually transitioned into the New Republic High Command.\", \"The Galactic Empire tracked the Rebels to Yavin 4 and attempted to destroy the moon with the Death Star, a deep-space mobile battle station capable of destroying entire planets, in 0 BBY. The Rebels launched the Battle of Yavin in a successful attempt to destroy the Death Star, an event that was carried out by Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker. Though the Death Star was destroyed, the Rebels evacuated the Great Temple as the Empire still knew where the Alliance was housed. The initial search for a new base was conducted by General Jan Dodonna during the evacuation from Yavin 4. The Rebels eventually decided to establish their new base of operations on the ice planet Hoth in 1 ABY, with the Rebellion then spending the next two years building what became Echo Base. Over those two years, rebel engineers expanded ice caverns in a feat of engineering work. Once the area was finally carved and expanded, completing the base for use in 3 ABY, the Rebellion inhabited Echo Base for less than a month before the Empire discovered it. The base's South Corridor and many others were built by Major Kem Monnon's engineers.\\n\\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, searched for Skywalker\\u2014who he had learned was his son\\u2014across the galaxy. \", \"The remaining base personnel proceeded to evacuate, as the 501st Legion, led by Darth Vader, entered the base. The overwhelming Imperial invasion forced the Rebellion to scatter their fleet across the galaxy, leading to a multitude of scattered skirmishes across the galaxy before the Empire's sudden and crushing defeat at the Battle of Endor.\\n\\n## Prelude\\n\\nFollowing the Rebel Alliance's major victory at Yavin, the Rebellion abandoned its base on Yavin 4 and began searching the galaxy for new possible bases of operation, considering worlds, such as Daxan Beta and Insk. They also attempted to set up base at Crait. In the subsequent three and a half years of conflict, General Jan Dodonna ordered a mission to find a base for the High Command, drawing up a list of potential planets, which included Hoth. During that mission, an Rebel Alliance Special Forces soldier named Purpruff traveled to the planet of Hoth in the Anoat sector and filed a report on it. Subsequently, the Corps of Engineers constructed the base over the course of two standard years, hoping to claim it as their new base of operations while avoiding the watchful eyes of the Empire. The base was inhabited for less than a month before the battle took place.\\n\\nFollowing the defeat of the Empire three and a half years earlier at the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance suffered from relentless Imperial attacks during the Mid Rim Retreat. \", \"\\nThe base was occupied by 7,500 combat personnel and 350 medical personnel, and contained a command center where the Rebel leadership coordinated Rebel activities, including the eventual evacuation from Hoth. Most of the troops present slept in enormous bunkers with several hundred others, and often had scant rations.\\n\\nAdditionally, many droids could be found around Echo Base, such as 2-1B, K-3PO, R-3PO, EG-4, R5-M2, and many other droids that helped the Rebel Alliance in some way.\\n\\n## Threats\\n\\nBesides the possibility of the Galactic Empire eventually finding Echo Base, there were other threats to the encampment. Hoth was continually pelted by meteors from its asteroid belt. Designed to be evacuated at a moment's notice, the base was hastily constructed, and often as not, wampa ice creatures would sneak into the base at night, forcing the closures of various corridors.

In the year 0 BBY, Byrnloo and two other human thugs were drinking at the bar of Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in the spaceport of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine when local moisture farmer Luke Skywalker and the hermit Obi-Wan Kenobi entered with the droids C-3PO and R2-D2.\\n\\nByrnloo and the two others then left the cantina and joined Jabba, three Rodians, and the bounty hunter Boba Fett in traveling to Docking Bay 94 in Mos Eisley, where the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon was docked. \", \"Byrnloo and the two others then left the cantina and joined Jabba, three Rodians, and the bounty hunter Boba Fett in traveling to Docking Bay 94 in Mos Eisley, where the YT-1300 light freighter known as the Millennium Falcon was docked. The starship belonged to Han Solo, a smuggler who worked for Jabba but owed him money after dumping a shipment of the Hutt's spice in space upon encountering an Imperial ship. Byrnloo and his cohorts began searching around the ship as Jabba called out to Solo to come out and meet him.\\n\\nThe sisters Brea and Senni Tonnika, who were planning on stealing the Falcon, then sneaked in the back of the docking bay. Upon seeing Byrnloo and the other thugs with Jabba, the pair abandoned their plan and left to look for a different ship. Solo, who was not aboard the ship at all, then surprised Byrnloo and the others when he addressed Jabba from the entryway to the bay, having just arrived from the nearby cantina.\\n\\nThe Hutt chastised Solo for having not repaid him and for killing Greedo, another of his thugs, in the cantina. Solo then offered to repay the Hutt with interest using credits from a job he had just accepted from Kenobi. The two haggled over the interest amount that the smuggler would pay, settling on fifteen percent. Satisfied, Jabba called off his thugs, and Byrnloo and the others made their way out of the docking bay.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\n\", \"Following this, he left to celebrate in Chalmun's Cantina, only to be found by Solo, Chewbacca and an escaped prisoner named Phaedra. Upon being interrogated, Greedo told them the urn was stored in Tarkin's office on Coruscant and that the Falcon was in a docking bay in Mos Entha. Solo then punched Greedo and left him unconscious in the street as he and his crew left to retrieve the Falcon. Sometime later, Greedo was met by Tyra, who supplied him with burnt Ronto meat to pass off to Jabba as D'Naran's ashes. Despite Jabba's suspicions, the ploy worked and Greedo received the reward. He then met back up with Tyra, who told Greedo that he wanted to tie up loose ends since he still had a score to settle with Solo.\\n\\nGreedo was hunting Solo for the bounty Jabba placed on his head after the smuggler dropped a large shipment of illicit cargo owned by the Hutt to avoid Imperial arrest. A fellow Rodian bounty hunter named Neesh, who actually had been hired to kill Greedo before outsourcing the job to Spruch Goa, had encouraged Greedo to make a play at capturing Solo. Despite Neesh urging him to act alone when confronting Solo, Greedo hired Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba as backup.\\n\\nTo corner the smuggler, Greedo traveled to the Mos Eisley Cantina, where he also attempted to collect money owed to him by Bith musician Lirin Car'n. \", \"Greedo challenged Solo at the Mos Eisley Cantina, where, threatening Solo with his DT-12 heavy blaster pistol, he demanded that he pay the money to Jabba or to Greedo himself; or hand over Solo's legendary starship, the Millennium Falcon. When Solo replied that he would rather die than give up his ship, Greedo said that was indeed the idea before announcing that it was something he had been looking forward to for a long time. As Greedo pulled his trigger and said that he would end with him, Solo shot Greedo dead from beneath the table with his readily prepared blaster. Greedo missed Solo completely and the last thing that Greedo ever saw was a flash of bright light with a memory of bitter injustice. Greedo's body collapsed over the table, and his blood got over the surface.\\n\\nThe blaster shots and Greedo's death silenced the cantina for a brief moment as the various patrons turned to see Solo and the dead bounty hunter, with Solo getting up to leave immediately after as if nothing important had happened. As he left, he threw a few credits to Wuher to apologize for the mess. While his mind was more interested on Kenobi's display with the lightsaber, Wuher dragged Greedo's body out of the building and cleaned up the Rodian's blood. Cantina patron Ohwun De Maal later gave a statement on the incident and noted Greedo had unholstered his blaster.\\n\\n\", \"Minutes later, more guards arrived with a medshuttle and Solo stunned the driver before he, \\\"Ovan\\\" and Greedo used it to escape from the penthouse. They then met back up with Chewbacca and used a landspeeder to reach the Falcon. Once they arrived, Solo told his supposed father that Graves' terminal said the urn had been sold to a buyer on Antillion and that he and Chewbacca could use an extra pair of hands. \\\"Ovan\\\" accepted the offer and joined them aboard the Falcon. When \\\"Ovan\\\" asked Solo if they would wait for Greedo to join them before they left Corellia, Solo said he only went along with Greedo because he claimed to know the location of the urn, which he clearly hadn't. Solo went on to say that the reward would only be split three ways as they left Greedo on Corellia and headed for Antillion.\\n\\nOnce they arrived on Antillion, Solo went on to explain that the urn had been sold to a Sava named Madelin Sun. When his supposed father doubted anyone on such a planet could buy the urn, Solo speculated that she may have traded something for it. Upon locating Sun's shop, Solo said he would negotiate for the urn. However, when Sun denied having any such urn in her possession, Solo told \\\"Ovan\\\" and Chewbacca that she definitely had it and that they would have to get her away from her collection. \", \"Solo asked the marshal where Tanna was, and he told him she was bound up on his ship as there had been a warrant out for her in connection with a Heist on Galator III. Vancto then informed Solo that he had made a deal with Chewbacca, that he was free to go in exchange for Tanna and her ship being taken by Vancto. After the marshal left, the rest of Tanna's crew asked where it left them, and Solo told them he intended to leave them. T'onga attempted to protest, but Solo refused to listen and reminded them they had done the exact same to him before, and he saw this as fair payback. Solo, Chewbacca, and Phaedra then departed on the Falcon, leaving Akko, Bynar, and T'onga. Eventually, Tyra was also able to leave the object and headed to Tatooine where he provided the Rodian bounty hunter Greedo with the urn containing charred ronto ashes, who then presented it to Jabba.\", \"Solo, then, in self defense, covertly pulled his DL-44 blaster pistol under the table; after Greedo tried to shoot Solo but missed, Solo fired back, killing the Rodian. Solo ignored the Murder tax Jabba enforced on Tatooine, opting instead to simply toss Wuher, the cantina's bartender, some credit chips, before apologizing for leaving a mess and then heading to Docking Bay 94. None of the witnesses present could agree whether Solo or Greedo shot first, but all confirmed Solo had the better shot of the two.\\n\\nSolo arrived in the docking and found Jabba himself, with several of his guards\\u2014including Jabba's top bounty hunter Boba Fett\\u2014 looking for him near the Falcon. Jabba inquired whether Solo was going to pay him, and why he had \\\"fried poor Greedo.\\\" Jabba was disappointed in having to put the bounty on Solo, the crime lord's top smuggler. Solo insisted he had had no choice but to dump the cargo, and informed the Hutt that he had secured a charter that would be able to compensate the Hutt's loss in full as soon as he completed it. Jabba was pleased and added that if Solo paid twenty percent interest all could be forgotten, but Solo talked him down to fifteen percent, and ironically stated that the Hutt was a \\\"wonderful Human being,\\\" before boarding the Falcon.\\n\\n\", \"When the man asked what his father's name was, Solo said it was Ovan. The man then exclaimed that Ovan was his name and claimed that he had found his son. In reality, the man was the criminal Corbus Tyra. As Solo's supposed father tried to embrace his supposed son, Solo punched him, believing the man to be conning him. When Han accused him of faking his injury, \\\"Ovan\\\" removed his eye patch and revealed his scar, remarking that shipbuilding was dangerous work. To this, Solo asked \\\"Ovan\\\" if he had any powerful tools like a plasma cutter, which the man confirmed that he did.\\n\\nAfterwards, Solo met back up with Chewbacca on the Falcon, where they discussed whether the man was actually Solo's father. When Greedo accused Solo of being sentimental, Solo explained that the man claiming to be his father was going to help them retrieve the urn. Chewbacca then pointed out that Graves had hired private security since Solo broke into his penthouse, to which Solo claimed the guards would be their way in. Later, Solo found \\\"Ovan\\\" at one of the docks and took the plasma cutter from him. When \\\"Ovan\\\" suggested going along with them for the heist, Solo refused until \\\"Ovan\\\" recalled a conversation he'd had with Solo on the same dock when Solo was a child. Despite Greedo's objections and Chewbacca's suspicions, Solo took his supposed father with them as they burst into a local laundromat and took three guards' security uniforms. \", \"\\nGreedo's death angered a group of fellow Rodians based on Tatooine, who saw Greedo as a brother Rodian and thus wanted revenge on Solo. The masked Sana Starros met with the Rodians to learn Solo had departed the planet by that point. In the end, Greedo had never established the legacy for himself he hoped to earn. The successful jobs he did carry out were regarded as mid-level affairs and were forgotten with time. As reasoned by the pirate Hondo Ohnaka, Greedo was likely more famous for his death at the hands of Solo than anything the bounty hunter did in his life.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\nAs a boy, Greedo was noted for his temper and tendency to pick fights with others, which his friend, Wald warned would lead to trouble. In adulthood, Greedo was overconfident and slow on the uptake, and something of a poor shot with a blaster. He thought highly of himself as a \\\"big time\\\" bounty hunter due to his employment to Jabba the Hutt, even believing himself more prestigious than Boba Fett, though others saw him as unremarkable.\\n\\nHe was a frequent customer of Chalmun's Cantina, considering it his base of operations and preferred venue for death deals. He was known for rotten luck, and that proved true for the majority of his life.

The battle featured four separate parts and was conceived by Queen Padm\\u00e9 Amidala upon returning to her planet, after unsuccessfully pleading with the Galactic Senate for help. The plan would be to use the Gungans and their Grand Army to lure the Trade Federation army away from Theed, the capital city, so Amidala and her security forces could infiltrate the palace and capture Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Meanwhile, a team of starfighter pilots would enter orbit in an assault on the Federation command ship, the destruction of which would disable all Federation battle droids on the planet.\\n\\nIn what became known as the Battle of the Great Grass Plains or simply the Battle of the Grassy Plain, the Gungans lured the Federation army away from the city to distract them through a fight in the Great Grass Plains, while the queen and her team made their way to the palace in the Battle of Theed, which was also known as Second Battle of Theed due to a prior engagement. Once inside, and as the starfighter pilots made their way into orbit after being freed, the Naboo were confronted by the Sith Lord Darth Maul. \", \"# Governor of Theed\\n\\nGovernor of Theed was a title given to the governor of Theed, the capital city of the planet Naboo, ruled by the Royal House of Naboo. During Queen Padm\\u00e9 Amidala's coronation in 32 BBY, the governor, along with the Naboo Royal Advisory Council, closed the Palace Plaza to allow the Volunteer Security Forces Parade and March to take place. The Governor of Theed was mentioned in A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy, a book that looked at the use of propaganda by various factions, released around 34 ABY.\", \"# Head of Security\\n\\nHead of Security was a title held by the commanding officer of the Royal Naboo Security Forces and individual personally responsible for the Monarch of Naboo's safety.

In 28 BBY, Sach\\u00e9, a handmaiden of outgoing Queen Padm\\u00e9 Amidala, successfully ran for a seat in the legislature. Members of the legislature held the title of Representative.\", \"# Naboo\\n\\nNaboo was a bountiful planet in the Chommell sector of the Mid Rim, in the Trailing Sectors and close to the border of the Outer Rim Territories. It was home to the indigenous Gungan species and to a population of humans known as the Naboo. Naboo was pushed to the forefront of galactic politics as the birthplace of the Dark Lord of the Sith Sheev Palpatine, who served as its representative in the Senate of the Galactic Republic.\\n\\nUnder the guise of his Sith title Darth Sidious, Palpatine secretly engineered an invasion of his peaceful homeworld by the Trade Federation, a megacorporation in a bid for power. Ostensibly done in protest over proposed taxation of formerly free trade routes, the Federation's invasion led to an outpouring of support from the Senate for both Palpatine and the newly-elected Queen of Naboo, Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. Amidala led a successful resistance movement and removed the Federation from her world during the Battle of Naboo. Palpatine subsequently rose to the office of the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, with Amidala eventually taking his place as the planet's senatorial representative.\\n\\nNaboo would commit itself firmly to democracy in the intervening years, staying loyal to the Republic during the pan-galactic Clone Wars, which saw several military engagements against the Confederacy of Independent Systems come to the planet. By the time of the war's end, Palpatine had amassed considerable power and proclaimed himself the head of a new Galactic Empire. \", \"Amidala guided her home planet through the invasion and sealed a new friendship with the Gungans. In an upsurge of sympathy and solidarity toward the invaded planet, the queen's emissary in the Galactic Senate, the seemingly unassuming Senator Sheev Palpatine, was made Supreme Chancellor of the Republic.\\n\\nNaboo recovered quickly from the invasion under Amidala's remaining years, managing to almost completely restore its harvests and crop yields by the end of her final term. One of Amidala's final projects, which continued under the reign of her successor, was the implementation of an ion pulse in Theed in case of future invasions. The decision to install the pulse, whilst meeting with general approval, was nevertheless controversial as some, such as Quarsh Panaka, favored the idea of more robust and extensive defenses whilst others felt that installing any weapon system was against everything Naboo stood for in terms of peace.\\n\\nA series of miners strikes occurred on the moons of Naboo. A mudslide disaster occurred on Naboo's secondary continent in 22 BBY. Both the Naboo and the Gungans remained loyal to the Republic during the Clone Wars, though many on Naboo were in despair at the idea of a galaxy-wide war. Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala and Representative Jar Jar Binks worked together to represent the interests of the Naboo and Gungans respectively in the Galactic Senate. During the Clone Wars, Neeyutnee served as Queen of Naboo. \", \"\\nTen years before the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation was forced to invade the planet Naboo by its hidden master, Darth Sidious. Over the course of the Battle of Theed, the Federation failed to capture the planet's Queen, Padm\\u00e9 Amidala, despite the assistance of the Sith Lord Darth Maul. She fled to Coruscant to plead her case to the Galactic Senate, to no avail as many Senators were, as Palpatine put it, \\\"on the Trade Federation's payroll.\\\"\\n\\nDeciding to take action herself, she returned to Naboo and, with the aid of the exiled Gungan Jar Jar Binks, the Queen went to the Gungan Sacred Place to convince Boss Rugor Nass, leader of the Gungans, to align with the human population of Naboo. The Trade Federation had managed to drive the Gungans to their sacred place after invading their homes. Amidala humbled herself before the Gungans, begging them for their help, and Nass pledged to support to her, forging a historic pact between the Naboo and the Gungans. Once what remained of the Royal Naboo Security Forces had been summoned to their hiding place, the Queen, head of security Captain Panaka, and Nass devised a plan to retake Naboo. By the time Amidala returned to the planet, only one Droid Control Ship was left in orbit.\\n\\nDuring the planning session, Nass made Binks a Bombad General for the upcoming battle. \", \"\\nThough one of the less corrupt Imperial officials, Panaka was assassinated by Saw Gerrera's Partisans insurgency in 3 BBY. Due to its status as Palpatine's homeworld, Naboo prospered during the Age of the Empire. Its economy and environment were regarded to be far healthier than most worlds which had been subject to Imperial rule. Nevertheless, the people of Naboo resented the fact that it was their world that brought forth a man like Palpatine. The Empire also demilitarized Naboo and dissolved the Royal Naboo Security Forces's starfighter wing. As a result, Naboo lacked any combat-trained pilots by the time of the Battle of Endor.\\n\\nSab\\u00e9, former handmaiden of Padme Amidala, brought Darth Vader to Naboo in 3 ABY.

Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star.

Possessing the wisdom and teachings of his own masters, Skywalker tried to educate his young student through the ways of the Force. Telling tales of Master Yoda onto Grogu, the young Jedi Master passed on what he had learned, echoing Yoda's words \\\"size matters not\\\" and to do, not try. However, Skywalker strived to make impression on his small student, having to stop him from using the Force to eat creatures and let Grogu use the Force as he did. Knowing that knowledge lied in Grogu's memory, Luke offered to help him remember and placed his hands gently on the alien's head.

Yoda completed the trials and was deemed worthy of learning the secret of eternal consciousness.\\n\\nAfter the end of the Clone Wars and the fall of the Jedi Order, Yoda revealed Obi-Wan Kenobi that Jinn had returned from the netherworld of the Force and could guide his former Padawan in learning the secret.

After communing with the Force spirit of Kenobi, Skywalker traveled to Dagobah, where he discovered Yoda, the ancient Grand Master of the Jedi Order.

By the time Luke returned to Dagobah to finish his Jedi training, Yoda had become ill and was on the verge of becoming one with the Force. Yoda told Skywalker that, while he required no further formal training, he had to confront his father one last time in order to finally become a true Jedi. Skywalker not only passed his final test, but also inspired Vader to turn away from the dark side, destroying the Sith and fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One.\\n\\nWith the Sith defeated, Luke Skywalker wandered the galaxy searching for knowledge that could help restore the Jedi Order.

Shortly after the Falcon escaped, the docking bay was destroyed along with the rest of the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin.\", \"# Millennium Falcon\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon, originally designated YT 492727ZED and formerly known as the Stellar Envoy, and registered or known under various aliases and pseudonyms including Broken Bell, Corell's Pride, Close Shave, Fickle Flyer, Foul Matter, Graphite Skipper, Jin-Den Smoke, Longshot, Lost and Found, Star Princess, Sunfighter Franchise, Sweet Suprise, Meetyl's Misery, Wayward Son, and Victory Ring, was a Corellian YT-1300 light freighter built around 60 BBY. Earning a legendary status under their ownership, the ship was most famously used by the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca before, during, and following the Galactic Civil War.\\n\\nDuring the Falcon's time in the possession of the smuggler Lando Calrissian, it accumulated numerous modifications in the name of convenience and luxury, including painted exterior paneling and a large escape pod. However, during Han Solo's famous record-breaking Kessel Run, in which he piloted the freighter for the first time, many of these additions were destroyed or lost, leaving the ship battered by the time Solo won it from Calrissian shortly afterwards in a game of sabacc. Its aged appearance still belied numerous advanced modifications to boost the ship's speed, weapons, and shields, including a hyperdrive engine among the fastest in the entire galaxy, enabling it to outrun Imperial Star Destroyers. It also included sensor-proof smuggling compartments, which were used during the rescue of Princess Leia Organa in 0 BBY to evade Imperial stormtroopers. \", \"# Stasis-type shield generator\\n\\nThe Novaldex stasis-type shield generator was a device that worked in a crucial system that prevented passengers aboard a starship from aging at a drastically different rate than 'realspace time' when traveling through hyperspace.

A ship of this type was standing on the shore of Nymeve Lake on Takodana when the Millennium Falcon landed next to it.\", \"Following Solo's death soon after, the Millennium Falcon became a Resistance vessel piloted by its new owner, Rey, throughout much of the First Order-Resistance War. In 35 ABY, the ship was once again captained by Calrissian during the Battle of Exegol, which saw a decisive victory for the Resistance and Jedi Order, before being returned to Rey, who had been newly dubbed a Skywalker.\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nThe Millennium Falcon was a YT-1300 light freighter of the YT-1300f variety. Its basic shape was defined by two convex saucers welded together, a pair of front-facing mandibles and an outrigger-style, side-mounted cockpit with transparisteel viewports. Apart from the shape of its chassis, the Falcon retained very little of its off-the-dock instrumentation. Because its successive owners either upgraded or downgraded every system according to their personal specifications, the freighter ended up becoming a unique ship. These customizations, however, came at the price of reliability, and the Falcon was known to suffer frequent breakdowns in the heat of battle. After the circular military-grade sensor dish was lost during the Battle of Endor, the dish was replaced with the base rectangular model which was originally supplied with the ship. During the Battle of Crait, the Falcon again lost its rectenna, and it was replaced with a military-grade rectenna similar to that of the one lost during the Battle of Endor. \", \"The cruiser eventually exploded into a large fireball, and the Millennium Falcon flew through the fire and wreckage as Vader chased the latter in his TIE Advanced x1.

When the ship's bay doors opened in response to detecting the rebel transponder, Admiral Ackbar ordered all fighters to launch if the bay doors responded to the transponders; the Geist thus launched its fighters. After Princess Organa and rebel forces investigated and located the transponder codes to deactivate Shu-Torun system blocks on the Executor, the rebels used the Shu-Torun cruiser to board the Imperial flagship. By this time, the battle had escalated, and more cruisers of the class were under attack and exploding. Organa's circumvention of the blockers allowed the Republic to escape.\\n\\nAfter regrouping, the Republic returned to the Mako-Ta docks and attacked the Executor while several rebel transports landed on the surviving cruisers, including several of the class, and distributed the override codes. \", \"\\nAt this time, Vader's Imperial Death Squadron arrived and, after pausing to foster fear, attacked the Alliance Fleet, which was caught defenseless, exposed, and without the ability to launch starfighters. Vader's flagship, the Super Star Destroyer Executor, first attacked Yavin's Hope, the flagship of General Vanden Willard, destroying it. Afterward, the Imperial fleet attacked various Mon Calamari vessels, and one cruiser of the class was near another model of Mon Calamari ship. By the time the Rebel YT-1300 light freighter named the Millennium Falcon arrived at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, Commander Lajaie's cruiser was attacked by the Executor as the rebels attempted to break through the system failure. Not having enough time, Commander Lajaie ordered all crew to evacuate the cruiser with the escape pods and for those who survived to inform other rebel personnel that some operating systems could be bypassed and further details that they learned about the failures.\\n\\nWhile sustaining a barrage, Lajaie's cruiser began exploding as its escape pods launched. Under orders from Vader, Imperial forces targeted the escape pods, and many were destroyed by TIE fighters. The cruiser eventually exploded into a large fireball, and the Millennium Falcon flew through the fire and wreckage as Vader chased the latter in his TIE Advanced x1. \", \"\\nThe weaponry of the Millennium Falcon was normally suited for a much larger warship. It included two CEC AG-2G quad laser cannons  with enhanced laser actuators and gas feeds, which gave them maximum range and damage. These served as its primary defensive armament, able to destroy enemy fighters with a single direct hit. Between the forward mandibles, there were two Arakyd ST2 concussion missile tubes, each of which carried a four-missile magazine. Additionally, a BlasTech Ax-108 \\\"Ground Buzzer\\\" blaster cannon mounted near the ventral boarding ramp allowed its crew to defend the ship against infantry and other light targets while on the ground.\\nDuralloy plates salvaged from an Imperial cruiser afforded the Falcon capital ship-class hull armor.\\n\\nThe ship had three deflector shield generators: the bow was protected from both lasers and concussion missiles by Torplex and Nordoxicon units, while a Kuat Drive Yards generator shielded the stern.\\n\\nThe Falcon's combination of sublight speed and maneuverability was comparable to most of the starfighters fielded by the Rebellion and Empire, while its shielding, hyperdrive, heavy armor and weapons were on par with those typically found on capital ships These traits made it an ideal choice for General Lando Calrissian's attack run within the bowels of the Death Star during the Battle of Endor. While agile and almost near impervious to almost all heavy weapons and turbolasers as any large warship, the Falcon's only real combat weakness was its sheer size in comparison to starfighters. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.7984614172988153, "reason": "The actual output aligns with the expected output and includes a citation, but it adds extra detail about the 'YT-1300f variety,' which is not present in the expected output.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "local model", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "______________________\n| TaskNode | Level == 0 |\n*******************************\nLabel: None\n\nInstructions:\nExtract the citation annotation of format [#] or [#, #] used in the answer `actual_output`, if not ciation is present return null\n\ncitation annotation:\n[1]\n \n \n__________________________________\n| BinaryJudgementNode | Level == 1 |\n************************************************\nLabel: None\n\nCriteria:\ntest whether `citation annotation` is present in the format [#] or [#. #] and not null\n\nVerdict: True\nReason: The citation annotation is present in the format [#] and is not null.\n \n \n________________________\n| VerdictNode | Level == 2 |\n**********************************\nVerdict: True\nType: GEval\n\nCriteria:\nNone\nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check whether the facts in 'actual output' contradicts any facts in 'expected output'\",\n    \"You should heavily penalize when 'actual output' is missin a citation of the format [#]\",\n    \"You should also moderately penalize omission of detail\",\n    \"Vague language, or contradicting OPINIONS, are not OK\",\n    \"do not check, comment, or penalize whether 'expected output' has citations\"\n]"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "local model", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}]}, "{\"actual_output\": \"Boba Fett successfully captured Han Solo to collect the bounty placed on him by Jabba the Hutt [2][7].\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": \"Boba Fett captured Han Solo to collect Jabba the Hutt's bountys\", \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Who successfully captured Han Solo to collect the bounty placed on him by Jabba the Hutt?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"# Loje Nella\\n\\nNella later took part in a trap laid for Princess Leia Organa, who freed Jabba's prisoner Han Solo from carbonite while she thought the Hutt was sleeping.

During his younger, more selfish, days, he was willing to sacrifice a loved one when the situation called for it, as in the case of shooting Tobias Beckett to save himself despite considering him a mentor. However, he came to change as he met Luke Skywalker and the Rebellion. After Han demonstrated his bravery on the Death Star and proved his loyalty, they became genuine friends, and soon after, Han became loyal to the Rebellion.

By the end of this scheme, during which he reunited with Qi'ra, Han was forced to kill his mentor after a brutal double-cross. Han also became rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler Lando Calrissian and the Wookiee Chewbacca, the latter who became his best friend.

Developed at 5,000 credits and given out to Jedi after the Jedi Military Integration Act was passed, Jedi Commander armor was a modified version of the clone trooper armor. It was developed during the Clone Wars and utilized by the Jedi Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic, who fought alongside the clone troopers on numerous battlefronts across the galaxy. Notwithstanding the Force powers and lightsaber combat skills of the Jedi, they were vulnerable to blaster fire and as such wore armor over their ceremonial robes during the conflict against the Separatist Droid Army, which was composed of billions of battle droids.\\n\\nAnother type of armor used by the Jedi was the Jedi Reconnaissance Armor.

Skywalker, Tano, and R2 were able to destroy the starfighters, but were forced to crash land in the Dune Sea.\\n\\nFollowing the mission, Skywalker had the Twilight salvaged. Skywalker would tinker with Twilight's machinery using it to teach Tano mechanical skills, something he considered an important skill one should know. Skywalker would also use it as an asset in secret missions.\\n\\nFollowing the destruction of Master Plo Koon's fleet in the Abregado system at the hands of General Grievous and the mysterious Malevolence, Skywalker, Tano, and R2 took the Twilight to the system to search for survivors. Their search was initially fruitless, but when Tano sensed Koon in the debris field, she took the controls and piloted the ship to the lone escape pod, where they rescued Koon, Clone Commander Wolffe, Clone Sergeant Sinker, and Boost. As they prepared to leave, the Malevolence arrived, and the Twilight powered down to avoid detection in the debris field. Unfortunately, TB-2, the 2-1B-series medical droid, was left on to care for the injured clones, and Grievous spotted them and fired the ion cannon. \", \"\\nA year after the establishment of the Empire, Black Sun took notice of pilot Ahsoka Tano\\u2014although they only knew her by her alias of \\\"Ashla\\\" and did not know she was a former Padawan\\u2014after she intruded in their sentient trafficking, as the secret Force-sensitive had taken to helping the people of the Outer Rim. Learning that \\\"Ashla\\\" had been hired by the Fardi clan, Black Sun knew they could pay her more than the smaller group, though they also wanted her to work to make back the thousands of credits she had cost them. Thus, Black Sun ordered their agents to either hire or kill the pilot. When one Black Sun agent found her on an Outer Rim planet, Tano rejected their job offer, escaping aboard her light freighter as the agent fired on her.\\n\\nUsing their sleek starship, the agent pursued Tano, even as she concurrently realized her encounter with the agent had helped clear her mind of doubts. Tano and the agent's dogfight was interrupted by Chardri Tage's starship, having been sent by Senator Bail Prestor Organa to locate Tano, and the agent elected to escape instead of attack the larger craft. \", \"\\nThe Twilight was originally owned by the Hutt crime lord Ziro Desilijic Tiure, who used it as a spice freighter. In 22 BBY, early in the Clone Wars, Ziro allied himself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems in a plot to take over his nephew Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire, as well as sabotaging relations between the Galactic Republic and the Hutt Clan. As a result, the Twilight was present on the Wild Space planet Teth, at a landing platform near a B'omarr Order Monastery where the Separatists were holding Jabba's abducted son, Rotta. During the subsequent battle at the monastery as Republic forces attempted to locate the child, the spy droid 4-A7 and several battle droids were loading cargo aboard the ship when they were discovered by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and Skywalker's astromech R2-D2, who had rescued Rotta and were escaping Separatist commander Asajj Ventress. Realizing that 4-A7 was not the \\\"caretaker droid\\\" he had claimed to be, Tano destroyed him and the battle droids before she and her master claimed the Twilight.\\n\\nAt first, the Twilight refused to start up, but Skywalker and R2 were able to fire up the engines and attempted to land on the nearest Jedi Cruiser.

During the late era of the Galactic Republic, the human bounty hunter Jango Fett became the template of an army of clone troopers secretly built on the planet Kamino.\\n\\nDarth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith and Emperor of the Galactic Empire, engineered a clone of himself to serve as a vessel for his essence, thereby allowing him to resurrect himself after his first death. Sidious was also the template of his cloned son, a failed strandcast who was engineered by the Sith Eternal cult on Exegol.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nCloning was the scientific process of using a living organism's genetic code as a template in order to create one or more clones of the original source. Without alterations to the template, the clone would be an exact duplicate of its progenitor. By manipulating the genetic structure of the template, a clone's genotype could be modified for various purposes such as growth acceleration and greater docility.\\n\\nA single genetic sample taken from an original organism was sufficient to grow millions of clones. Host samples degraded over time, however, making the donor essential for replacement samples. The cloning process could be sustained without the original host, but only by rationing the last viable samples of DNA. Eventually a new template would have to be selected in order to grow more clones.\\n\\n\", \"# Cloning\\n\\nCloning was the process of duplicating an organism into one or many genetically identical individuals known as clones. During the final years of the Galactic Republic, an army of clone troopers was grown on the planet Kamino. Using the human Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett as a template, the Kaminoans tampered with Fett's genetic structure to make his clones more docile. In addition, they were designed to grow at twice the rate of normal human aging, making the clone troopers ready for deployment in a decade's time. At Fett's request, an unmodified clone\\u2014Boba Fett\\u2014was created from his template and given to him to raise as his son.\\n\\nDuring the Clone Wars, Fett's clone soldiers served in the Grand Army of the Republic under Jedi leadership until Order 66 called for the destruction of the Jedi Order. The clones carried out their mandate due to their programming, eliminating most of the Jedi Knights across the galaxy, after which the Galactic Empire was formed by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Shortly thereafter, the entire clone army was decommissioned and replaced by birth-born stormtroopers.\\n\\nThe Empire ultimately fell to the New Republic after the Emperor's destruction. However, Sidious managed to cheat death. Through the combined use of cloning and the dark side of the Force, the Sith Lord transferred his spirit to a new host that had been cloned from his original body. \", \"# Rescue of Omega\\n\\nEarly in the Imperial Era, the young clone Omega was rescued from an abandoned facility on Bora Vio. Omega, a creation of the Kaminoan cloners, was highly valuable due to being one of only two clones in existence with the unaltered DNA of Jango Fett, who had served as the clone template for the Grand Army of the Republic. After her escape with Clone Force 99, a group of renegade clone commandos, shortly after the formation of the Galactic Empire, the Kaminoans wanted her back so they could create superior clones to keep the Empire's business. However, after the Empire tracked down the \\\"Bad Batch\\\" on Bracca, Prime Minister Lama Su sent the bounty hunter Cad Bane to retrieve the girl, over the objections of Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se as they had already hired Fennec Shand for the task. Having developed an attachment to Omega, Nala Se sent Shand to disrupt the rendezvous where Bane was scheduled to hand over Omega after learning that Lama Su wanted her terminated once the necessary genetic material had been extracted. Omega was able to escape while Shand and Bane fought each other, stealing a Kaminoan flight pod and sending a signal which allowed the Batch to track her down and pick her up.\\n\\n## Prelude\\n\\nAround 32 BBY, the cloners of the remote, Wild Space planet Kamino were approached by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas about creating an army for the Galactic Republic. \", \"Around 32 BBY, the cloners of the remote, Wild Space planet Kamino were approached by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas about creating an army for the Galactic Republic. Sifo-Dyas was murdered and the project hijacked by the Sith, who wanted to use the clones for their long-brewing revenge against the Jedi. The Sith Lord Tyranus hired bounty hunter Jango Fett to serve as the clone template. In addition to his substantial fee, Fett also requested one unaltered clone for himself, whom he named Boba and raised as a son. Over the course of their cloning work, however, the Kaminoans created another clone without the age acceleration and ingrained obedience standard to the clone troopers. This clone, a female named Omega, was unaware of the truth of her creation, working as a medical assistant to Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se. Nala Se developed an attachment to the young clone which stood in stark contrast to her view of the regular clone troopers as products and property.\\n\\nThe Clone Wars that Sifo-Dyas had foreseen began in 22 BBY at the First Battle of Geonosis, during which Jango Fett, who had been working for the Separatists at the time, was beheaded by Jedi Master Mace Windu. As the war dragged on, the Kaminoans were forced to stretch their remaining samples of Fett's DNA to create more clones, resulting in a decrease in quality. \", \"Around ten years prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas ordered the clone army for the Republic, having had visions of a future conflict. However, the Sith took over the project as part of their plot to destroy the Jedi Order, having Sifo-Dyas murdered by the Pyke Syndicate and concealing the true circumstances and location of his death from the Jedi. Count Dooku, posing as a Jedi to the Kaminoan cloners, provided the Kaminoans with a bio-chip to be implanted into the clones during the early phase of their growth period. This chip contained the order the Kaminoans knew as \\\"Clone Protocol 66\\\"\\u2014which, when activated, would ensure total obedience in the clones and cause them to violently lash out against the Jedi.\\n\\nThe Kaminoans, including Prime Minister Lama Su and Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se, believed the protocol existed as a contingency for rogue Jedi. Dooku, who was only known to the cloners under the alias of his Sith name, also convinced them that it was imperative the existence of the protocol and chips be kept secret from the Jedi, claiming it was what Sifo-Dyas had wanted. The clone army's existence became known to the Jedi just before the Clone Wars when Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi tracked clone template Jango Fett to Kamino while investigating an assassination attempt on Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala.\\n\\n\", \"As a result, the new clones were less efficient according to Lama Su, who recommended to Jedi Master Shaak Ti that the Order should procure another template due to their waning supply of Fett DNA. As the Clone Wars continued to spread across the galaxy, the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded Kamino with the aim of halting the world's cloning production. The Republic Military successfully defended Tipoca City from the Separatist Droid Army while Jedi General Anakin Skywalker prevented Asajj Ventress from stealing the last supply of Fett's genetic samples.\\n\\nShortly after the discovery of the Zillo Beast on Malastare, the Republic Military transferred the creature to the Republic capital for scientific study. In the aftermath of the beast's escape and subsequent death, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine ordered Doctor Sionver Boll to utilize its corpse as a clone template. The Empire's Advanced Science Division later succeeded in utilizing this prime clone to create a line of zillo beast clones which were kept in the Tantiss Base on Wayland.\\n\\nA premature execution of Order 66 led CT-5555 \\\"Fives,\\\" an Advanced Recon Commando with the 501st Legion, to investigate the cause of Jedi General Tiplar's death at the hands of CT-5385 \\\"Tup.\\\" Aided by the medical droid AZI-345211896246498721347, Fives learned that the \\\"tumor\\\" in Tup's brain was not part of the original Jango Fett genome; it was in fact an artificial construct that had been implanted in every clone during the initial phase of their development. \", \"Following the death of Sifo-Dyas, the Sith took control of his project and hired a human bounty hunter, Jango Fett, to serve as the army's clone template. Fett's genetic code served the foundation for millions of clone troopers who all shared the same face, voice, and combat prowess as their progenitor, although they were also structurally modified at the genetic level to make them less independent and more docile. The first clones of the Jango Fett genotype were designated as \\\"generation one,\\\" and among their ranks was Clone Captain CT-7567 of the 501st Legion.\\n\\nFurther genetic tampering caused Fett's clones to grow at twice the rate of the human species, making them ready for deployment in a decade's time. While the process of growing clone troopers was left to Kaminoan scientists, the Sith took a more active role in their programming, having supplied their cloners with behavioral modification biochips to be implanted in the brain of every clone at the earliest stage of their development. Portrayed as a structural inhibitor chip, they ostensibly made their hosts more docile and less aggressive than their template, but their true purpose was to force the clones to obey Order 66\\u2014a secret protocol authorizing the immediate extermination of the Jedi Order as enemies of the state.\\n\\nIn addition to Fett's considerable monetary fee, the Kaminoans compensated him by creating a clone\\u2014codenamed Alpha\\u2014that stood apart from the rest of his artificial progeny. \", \"\\nIn spite of Taun We's confidence in the clone army's training, Fett was indifferent to them, referring to his cloned progeny as \\\"livestock\\\" bred to fight and die as \\\"cannon fodder.\\\" He dismissed the Kaminoan aide's assumption that he would be proud of his clones, and reminded Taun We that they were the Kaminoans' creations.\\n\\nDuring the Separatist Crisis, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the clone army on Kamino while investigating an assassination plot against Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. Prime Minister Lama Su and Taun We took him on an inspection tour of the cloning facility in Tipoca City, believing he had been dispatched at the behest of the Jedi High Council and the Galactic Senate. During the tour, Kenobi learned the identity of clone army's template, Jango Fett, who was also the would-be assassin who tried to kill Amidala. Kenobi reported his findings to his superiors, Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Mace Windu, who ordered him to bring the hunter to the Jedi Grand Temple on Coruscant for interrogation.\\n\\nFollowing the death of Jango Fett in the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, the Kaminoans were forced to conserve their remaining samples of the Fett genome in order to grow more clones for the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic.

She had this dream because, during her school years, she entered in a cooking class, and the teacher told Whitesun that her blue-milk cheese was the best he had ever tasted, prompting her to have such dream as the instructor said that it appeared that she was born to make blue-milk cheese.\\n\\nOn a supply run in Mos Espa, Whitesun stopped at Watto's junk shop to have her portable nav fixed.

Her mother, Sola, was uninterested in having a partner, although she was comfortable with having children, a position not uncommon on Naboo. Ryoo was raised on her people's home planet of Naboo during the final years of the Galactic Republic, along with her sister, Pooja. Her aunt, Padm\\u00e9 Amidala, met her shortly after she was born.

The family's origins dated back to Shmi Skywalker, who, as a young girl, was captured by pirates and forced into slavery. In 41 BBY, she conceived a son, Anakin Skywalker, who was born without a father. Anakin was the Chosen One destined to bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith. Possessing the highest concentration of midi-chlorians in his blood, Anakin had the potential to become the most powerful Force-sensitive being in the galaxy. The Force was strong in Anakin's bloodline, passing down to his progeny, the twin siblings Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, as well as Ben Solo, Organa's son and the last Skywalker in the direct line.\\n\\nThe Skywalkers were living on the desert planet Tatooine as slaves of the Toydarian junk dealer Watto when they encountered Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in 32 BBY. Intrigued by Anakin's origins and raw connection to the Force, Jinn sought to have him trained in the Jedi arts. \", \"Both alone after Cliegg's death, Owen and Beru decided to have a child, but problems of infertility precluded them to have one, leading them to consider seeing one of the fertility droids at Mos Eisley. When the galactic conflict came to a close, Beru and Owen became the guardians of their new nephew, Luke Skywalker, after his father turned to the dark side of the Force and became Darth Vader and his mother died in childbirth. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Jedi Master and friend of Anakin, delivered infant Luke to the Lars homestead. After receiving Luke, Beru told Owen that they would be raising his stepbrother's son as their own.\\n\\nFor the next nineteen years, Lars and her husband raised Skywalker like a son. Lars would often defend Skywalker's interests against Owen, who was overprotective of him out of fear that he would follow in Anakin's footsteps and try to become a Jedi Knight. In 9 BBY, Luke and Owen carried out work at the homestead, all the while being observed from a distance by Kenobi, who left some spare parts for a toy T-16 skyhopper for Luke. As they worked, however, Luke ran away from the labor, climbed on top the homestead, and pretended to podrace, all while Owen and Beru looked for Luke. Upon spotting Luke, Beru laughed while Owen expressed disappointment.\\n\\n\", \"Despite the recent loss of his adoptive family, Skywalker did not grieve until soon after the battle, when his love interest, Nakari Kelen, was killed on the planet Omereth. Kelen's death provided Skywalker a moment to consider his losses, and he wept upon thinking of his uncle and aunt. Skywalker later returned to Tatooine to recover Kenobi's journal, which contained stories of the Jedi's few encounters with the Lars family.\\n\\nIn the weeks after the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader searched for the pilot responsible for destroying the Death Star, discovering that the pilot was the son he never knew he had. Vader, accompanied by Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra, revisited the abandoned homestead and followed Skywalker's trail. While assessing the destruction, Aphra speculated that Skywalker might have never left Tatooine, had his family been spared.\\n\\n## Personality and traits\\n\\nIn contrast to her husband Owen, who was gruff and harsh, Beru Whitesun Lars was warm and loving.

As a result, Luke did not continue the Skywalker family bloodline as he never managed to sire any children. However, Luke once dreamed of a different life in which he never learned the ways of the Force. Instead, he remained on his homeworld of Tatooine, marrying his childhood friend Camie Marstrap. He also never left the moisture farming business, having chosen to continue supporting his uncle and aunt as a farmer. In this version of his life though, Luke dreamed of a more exciting life for himself, causing Camie to suspect that her husband regretted their marriage despite Luke's assurance to the contrary.\\n\\nAs a young man, Luke was fascinated by several women that he encountered as an aspiring Jedi, including his twin sister Leia Organa. The Skywalker twins developed a bond without knowing about their biological connection to each other. Luke and Organa had both lost their adoptive families, making them orphans in the civil war between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. In addition to their personal losses, the Skywalkers found themselves devoted to the same cause, fighting for the galaxy's freedom which strengthened the connection between them.\\n\\n\", \"Her brother, Luke was given to his relatives, Owen Lars and Beru Whitesun Lars, who raised him as a moisture farmer on Tatooine. Though Owen opposed his nephew's ambition to explore the greater galaxy by leaving Tatooine, Beru saw that Luke was too similar to his father to settle for the life of a farmer. While Luke yearned for a more interesting life, one filled with adventure and excitement, Leia succeeded her adoptive father as the senator of Alderaan.\\n\\nThough a member of the Imperial Senate, Organa secretly worked to undermine the Empire by supporting the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a rebellion founded with the aim of overthrowing the Empire and restoring democracy.

While C-3PO was able to translate the Sith inscriptions on the dagger, his programming prevented him from revealing the translation to anyone. \", \"# C-3PO\\n\\nC-3PO  was a 3PO-series protocol droid designed to interact with organics, programmed primarily for etiquette and protocol. Sometimes referred to as Threepio, he was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.\\n\\nC-3PO was rebuilt from spare parts by Anakin Skywalker, a human slave who lived in Mos Espa, a city on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. During the Clone Wars, he would serve the Naboo Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. Shortly after the Clone Wars, C-3PO's memory was erased, though R2-D2's memory was not. C-3PO and R2-D2 were assigned to the Alderaan cruiser Tantive IV, where they served senator Bail Organa for nineteen years, assisting in his fledgling resistance movement against the Galactic Empire. At some point during this time, C-3PO's right leg was fitted with mismatched plating.\\n\\nC-3PO remained constant companions with R2, and in 0 BBY, the pair became embroiled in the Galactic Civil War when Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance entrusted them to bring a copy of the Death Star plans to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. \", \"# Memory wipe\\n\\nA memory wipe was a method that was used to selectively or completely erase the memory of a droid. It was an act sometimes performed on unwitting droids by dregs and criminals. After Cad Bane had kidnapped and ransacked the memory of C-3PO and R2-D2 for information on the Senate Building's layout, he only had the incident wiped from their memories to avoid having any suspicion falling on him.\\n\\nShortly after the Galactic Empire was formed, Bail Organa, in order to protect Princess Leia, had C-3PO's memory wiped clean in order for the droid to not spill any confidential information, especially information related to Leia's true lineage, which would make her a target of the Emperor. When he purchased C-3PO and R2-D2, Owen Lars also wanted the droids' memories wiped after he learned they were looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi. C-3PO's memories were  wiped again on Kijimi when the droidsmith Babu Frik bypassed C-3PO's programming restrictions to allow the droid to translate the Sith writings on a Sith dagger. C-3PO's photoreceptors turned red while he translated the forbidden inscriptions. After completing the translation C-3PO rebooted, and his memory was wiped in the process, leaving him to restart with his basic factory programming.\\n\\nMemory wipes were an important process, and the lack of one could allow droids to develop new ideas. \", \"C-3PO's inability to lie came at a disadvantage when he and his companions were captured by Ewoks prior to the Battle of Endor. Due to his general inability to keep secrets, Bail Organa arranged for him to receive a memory wipe in order to preserve the secret of Anakin and Padm\\u00e9's offspring, Luke and Leia.\\n\\nThreepio's programming, focused on etiquette and protocol, impacted his personality and limited his behavior in several other ways. On Endor, he found it difficult to impersonate a deity due to his programming, and during the attack on the Resistance fleet, he attempted to leave a mutiny in progress because it was not correct protocol.\\n\\nC-3PO continued serving Leia Organa in her careers as New Republic senator and subsequently Resistance General. C-3PO managed General Organa's Resistance droid spy network. Despite not being able to run or fight, C-3PO bravely stayed behind to hold back the First Order Agent Terex so that Poe Dameron and the spy droid N1-ZX could flee deeper into the caves. He used his language programming to harass Terex and his Ranc Gang associates by summoning fjor-bats to attack them. C-3PO quipped that he was expendable and could be rebuilt.\\n\\n## Equipment\\n\\nC-3PO was a 3PO-series protocol droid, who stood at a height of 1.77 meters and weighed 75 kilograms. He had a masculine programming and had experienced at least two memory wipes throughout his operational life. \", \"N1-ZX was stationed on the planet Kaddak and reported to the protocol droid C-3PO, who served as General Leia Organa's spymaster. Prior to the Mission to Kaddak, N1-ZX managed to send a transmission to the Resistance base on D'Qar that it had acquired a large trove of information about the First Order including the location of Supreme Leader Snoke. In response, Organa dispatched Poe Dameron, C-3PO, BB-8, and the Abednedo technician Oddy Muva to recover N1-ZX.\\n\\nLater, N1-ZX was captured by the Ranc Gang, who wanted to sell the droid. Before this could happen, Dameron and C-3PO managed to force their way into the Ranc Gang's headquarters and freed N1-ZX by activating a sleeper cell of spy droids. Nunzix expressed little gratitude to his rescuers and chided them for taking too long. Despite C-3PO's orders, N1-ZX also refused to release his information on Snoke until they had left Kaddak. C-3PO explained that N1-ZX's self-preservation programming was deeply embedded into his processors. When Dameron proposed giving Nunzix a \\\"robo-lobotomy\\\", N1-ZX dared him to while C-3PO explained that doing so would result in a complete memory wipe. Dameron decided to take N1-ZX back to the ship, prompting Nunzix to reply that his name was \\\"Nunzix.\\\"\\n\\nBefore they could leave, Terex flew over Kaddak in his ship Carrion Spike and called on the local gangsters to seize Poe. \", \"While C-3PO was able to translate the Sith inscriptions on the dagger, his programming prevented him from revealing the translation to anyone. When Chewbacca was captured along with the dagger, the group went to Kijimi to find Babu Frik in order to retrieve the information in C-3PO's memory banks following the recommendations of Poe.\\n\\nBabu was able to bypass C-3PO's programming restrictions to allow C-3PO to speak the translation. Aware that the procedure would erase his memory, C-3PO decided to undergo it as he knew there was no other way to have a chance at defeating Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal. The protocol droid later regained his memory from a backup carried by R2-D2. Babu tinkered with C-3PO's main processing unit in order to locate the text of the inscription and override the programming preventing C-3PO from speaking the translation. During the procedure, C-3PO's photoreceptors became red as he spoke the words. After completing the translation C-3PO was rebooted with no memory, leaving him only with his base factory programming.\\n\\nUpon the departure of the Resistance fighters, Babu Frik contacted Jannah and the rest of Company 77 on Kef Bir in the hope that they would be able to aid the fighters on their quest to find the Emperor's wayfinder which would lead them to the Sith world of Exegol. \", \"\\n3PO-series droids were a modern model of protocol droid that succeeded the likes of the ancient Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II. Known as the \\\"talker droid\\\" or \\\"talky,\\\" the Autonomous Translator Module had its heyday but, in time, fell out of use. Despite being used as a protocol droid, the talky lacked the diplomacy modules seen in later protocol droids. While he knew the talky to be a predecessor to his own model, 3PO unit C-3PO regarded the talky as an inelegant, blocky design. Indeed, by the time of the 3PO-series, droid design had been streamlined instead of remaining like that of the talky.\\n\\n3PO droids in the Senate Office Building of the capital planet Coruscant served as aides, carrying drinks for senators, including the Supreme Chancellor. During the Clone Wars' Senate hostage crisis, one such droid occupied the Office Building's power control room, which was the operations center for not only power to the main structure itself, but also the Senate Building. This crucial waypoint for power supply was targeted by a group of bounty hunters led by the infamous Cad Bane. One of the group's IG-86 sentinel droid unit, HELIOS-3E, shot the Senatorial protocol droid as they stormed the control room.\\n\\nA Senatorial protocol droid trailed after Senator Dantum Roohd aboard Duchess Satine Kryze's starship, the Coronet, as it ferried a delegation led by Kryze from the world of Mandalore to Coruscant. \", \"\\nFollowing the Battle of Hoth in 3 ABY, the Rebel Alliance split its fleet into divisions, intending for the divisions to communicate with one another in order to reform. However, the Empire was able to crack the rebel encryption codes, and the Rebellion wished to devise a new method of secure communication. Aware of the Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II's existence, C-3PO suggested that the rebels use its knowledge of Trawak as the basis for a new code. In order to do so, the Rebellion planned a mission to steal the droid from the Imperial Museum, dispatching a team of Pathfinders, accompanied by the cyborg Lobot and former Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian.\\n\\nAfter learning of the droid's location within the private collection, the rebels drew the curator out and kept him distracted so that Lobot could slice the door and allow them to break in. The rebels located the talker droid, returning it to the combined fleet of the Fourth and Seventh Divisions. Once it was aboard the rebel flagship, C-3PO reactivated the droid. However, the talker droid's speech was garbled, and C-3PO determined that its memory banks and primary cognitive functions had been corrupted, leaving the rebels without a solution to their situation.\\n\\nSupervised by C-3PO and watched by several rebels, the astromech droid R2-D2 repaired the talker droid's circuits. The droid was successfully reactivated; however, it was still malfunctioning, speaking incoherently and rising up from the table it had been lying on. \"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.7284385109303192, "reason": "The actual output aligns with the expected output regarding Anakin Skywalker constructing C-3PO and his primary programming for etiquette and protocol.

The Jedi poured their Living Force presence into the Cosmic Force, allowing them to create a simulacrum of themselves and small objects over distances of several light-years. It was also possible to project several simulacra at the same time in the immediate vicinity of the caster.\\n\\nUsing this power was extremely taxing; Kylo Ren noted that Rey, whose power in the Force rivaled his own immense powers as a Skywalker, would die just by trying. Although Luke Skywalker maintained a projection for several minutes, giving all of himself to the Force to allow him to physically interact with his surroundings, the strain cost him his life.\\n\\nThe simulacrum, being only a projection, allowed one to appear to perform seemingly impossible feats, such as being unscathed after taking a barrage of blaster bolts, stabbed at with a weapon, or disappearing from one position and reappearing in another.

Ren used his new TIE whisper to travel to Exegol where he confronted Darth Sidious, who revealed the Sith Eternal's fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers, the Final Order, and ordered him to kill Rey and end the Jedi. Ren later used his TIE to confront the Jedi Rey on the desert world Pasaana, during which she jumped over his ship and sliced off one of its wings, causing it to crash. Ren flew another TIE of the same model to Kef Bir, where he again confronted Rey in a lightsaber duel. Defeating and wounding him, Rey took the TIE and flew it to Ahch-To, where she burned it, pledging that she would follow the path of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and exile herself to the island. However, Skywalker's Force spirit confronted her and convinced her to continue the fight. Rey then took the wayfinder from the wreckage and departed the planet in Luke's old X-wing starfighter.\", \"# Kylo Ren's command shuttle\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nKylo Ren's command shuttle featured two shield generators, instead of one as was typical on most starships. This simplified and strengthened shield distribution. The shuttle also featured an experimental magnetic field projection system, particularly effective against plasma rounds. This forced incoming projectiles off course.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nKylo Ren's command shuttle was present during the subjugation of Tuanul, Jakku and the Battle of Takodana landing at the remains of Takodana Castle. The ship delivered Rey to Starkiller Base where she was to be interrogated by Ren himself.\\n\\nAfter Ren usurped the title of Supreme Leader by killing Snoke, he and General Armitage Hux commanded the First Order forces during the Battle of Crait from the shuttle's bridge. After the sudden appearance of Luke Skywalker, Ren ordered the shuttle's pilot, Jober Tavson, to land the craft on the salty plains so he could confront his former Jedi Master, hurling General Hux against a control console when the man protested.\", \"As they made their way to Snoke's throne room, Rey implored Ren to abandon his journey down the dark path, having sensed Ren's conflict and how it caused him so much pain. Her confidence was further bolstered by the Force vision she experienced during their last connection, explaining that when they touched hands she saw a future where Ren no longer bowed before Snoke. However, Ren also had a vision of his own, one where he saw Rey standing by his side.\\n\\nRey's confrontation with Snoke led to her brutal interrogation by way of the Supreme Leader's Force powers, and as a result the location of Luke Skywalker's hermitage was successfully probed from her mind. Snoke, who intended to kill the last Jedi after dealing with the more immediate threat of the Resistance, held Rey in stasis and commanded Ren to kill her, exclaiming that this act would be the fulfillment of his dark destiny. Ren's emotions were even further churned up by the bond between himself and Rey, but his newfound resolve and clarity reassured Snoke that his oft-conflicted apprentice would not give into sentiment again. In the end, Snoke's visions and Force senses failed him for he did not see his end at the hands of his own disciple. Through guile and subterfuge, Ren cleaved Snoke in half with Rey's lightsaber, ending his master's life in an act worthy of the Sith Rule of Two.\\n\\n\", \"At another point in her training, as Rey worked on telekinesis, she kept the lightsaber by her bag. However, an inquisitive porg began to search through her belongings and snatched it, attempting to escape with into the ocean with it before Rey used the Force to pull the fleeing bird back to her and retrieve the weapon. The incident was a teaching moment for Rey, who had been able to focus on the power of telekinesis to retrieve the porg.\\n\\nAfter a fateful connection with Kylo Ren, Rey attacked Luke with her quarterstaff, demanding to know the truth of what transpired between the Jedi Master and his apprentice, Ben Solo, on the night of the Jedi temple's destruction. When Luke disarmed Rey of her melee weapon, she summoned the Skywalker lightsaber through telekinesis. Luke gave ground when Rey moved into an attack position, and the scavenger lowered the lightsaber while still demanding to hear the truth. After his confession, Rey offered Luke his old lightsaber once more, entreating him for the last time to join the fight against the First Order.\\n\\nDisillusioned by Luke's inaction, Rey departed from Ahch-To without him. She kept the Skywalker lightsaber and brought it with her to the Supremacy, flagship of Supreme Leader Snoke, where she confronted Kylo Ren in person. He ordered Rey to surrender the lightsaber to him upon seeing it in her hands, stating that it belonged to him. \", \"At this point, they discovered their ability to see, hear and touch each other through the Force. The bond allowed Rey to gain new insights into Ren, who no longer attempted to hide his pain and misery from her. Convinced that the light side still existed within the former Ben Solo, Rey chose to confront Ren in person, believing she could help him turn away from the dark side of the Force.\\n\\nRen's master, Supreme Leader Snoke, was aware of his apprentice's connection to a certain entity in the light, knowing that Ren's growing strength with the dark side meant that his equal would rise in the light. He assumed it would be Luke Skywalker, Ren's previous mentor, until he discovered Rey after her awakening in the Force. Snoke gloated in his success at having gathered Rey and Ren before him, for it proved beyond a doubt that there existed a unique bond between them. Using Snoke's reliance on sensing his every thought, Ren outmaneuvered his mentor and ultimately killed him. With Snoke's unexpected death, the Elite Praetorian Guards did all they could to stop their leader's assassin, causing Ren and Rey to fight alongside each other. Their bond grew even more powerful in combat, amplifying the powers of the two.\\n\\n\", \"Following her short and unconventional training under Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, Rey left the planet Ahch-To intent on confronting Ren in person.

Although he secured control of the bridge, Organa regained consciousness and subdued the Resistance pilot, thus ending the insurrection.\\n\\nBy then, Kylo Ren had taken Rey directly to his dark side master, Snoke, who tortured and interrogated Rey in order to learn the location of Skywalker's hermitage. Having gained the knowledge he sought, Snoke ordered Ren to execute Rey, but Ren instead saved her by killing his master. They stood together as allies against the late Snoke's Elite Praetorian Guards, all of whom fell in battle against both the Jedi and Master of the Knights of Ren. When Rey beseeched Ren to call off the First Order's attack on the Resistance, Ren revealed he had no intention of saving his mother's insurgents and invited Rey to rule the galaxy at his side. \", \"It also allowed one to project something other than one's true physical appearance, such as making oneself appear younger, or appearing to have an object not currently in one's possession. Despite being otherwise immaterial, the user was at least capable of physical contact with others and could even fool advanced sensors and droids.\\n\\n## History\\n\\nThe power of Force projection originated with the Fallanassi order. In 34 ABY, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker projected his appearance from Ahch-To to Crait, where he confronted his nephew, Kylo Ren, during the Battle of Crait. The feat was so strenuous that it led to Skywalker's death, after which he became one with the Force. He carried a copy of Han Solo's dice with him that he left with General Leia Organa, who left them at the old Rebel base on the planet. Ren discovered the dice, which disappeared shortly after Skywalker's death.\\n\\nSkywalker's ability to project himself became known in the wider galaxy after his death, so the story of his stand against tyranny spread hope as the First Order invaded. Though some believed in Skywalker's power, others\\u2014such as First Order Commander Branwayne Spiftz\\u2014saw it as nothing more than a myth; Spiftz referred to the ability mockingly while chastising Lieutenant Aderat over the \\\"disappearing\\\" Minfar resistance fighters.\", \"\\nRen pulled the lightsaber forward with the Force; as it levitated into Rey's hand, the upper half of Snoke's body fell to the floor while the lower half remained seated on his throne. Armed with their lightsabers, they fought together to defeat the Elite Praetorian Guards. When all but one of the guards were slain, Rey threw the Skywalker lightsaber to Ren, who killed the final sentry by igniting the plasma blade through the Praetorian's face-plate.\\n\\nAfter the battle, Ren offered Rey a place at his side as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, which she refused and attempted to take her lightsaber back by way of the Force. The two simultaneously pulled at the weapon, trapping it between them as they expended powerful Force energy to reclaim it. The strain eventually caused the kyber crystal within to crack and release a surge of energy that knocked the two combatants back, rendering Ren unconscious and sundering the lightsaber in half. Rey escaped with the pieces of the more than fifty-year-old relic and took them with her when she joined the Battle of Crait.\\n\\nDuring the battle, Luke Skywalker stepped onto the battlefield, appearing to wield his father's lightsaber against Kylo Ren, though this was actually an illusion brought about by a Force projection sent by Skywalker from Ahch-To through the power of the Force.
