Because of this, Spain is divided into 17 autonomous communities (''comunidades aut\\u00f3nomas''), plus two autonomous cities. As a result, some even describe Spain as a \\\"federation without federalism\\\". Some of the autonomous communities\\u2014notably the ones which have other official languages alongside Spanish\\u2014have been recognised as \\\"historical nationalities\\\" that have a unique historical identity.

There is everything from lush meadows and snowy mountains to huge marshes and deserts in the south east. While summer is the peak season, those who wish to avoid the crowds should consider visiting in the winter as not only is it normally mild and sunny, but attractions such as the Alhambra Palace in Granada and La Gran Mezquita in Cordoba will not be overcrowded. However the ski resorts of Sierra Nevada do get very crowded. The Mediterranean climate that predominates in Southern and Central Spain is noted for its dry summers and (somewhat) wet(ter) winters, so visiting in the winter or spring brings the added benefit of the vegetation looking much more healthy. Northern Spain (e.g. Asturias) on the other hand gets quite a bit of rain year round and is ripe with lush green vegetation even in August.\\n\\n===History===\\nSome of the earliest known remains of ''Homo'' of any kind ''in Europe'' have been found in Spain. Spain is also thought to have been the last refuge of the Neanderthals, and one of the few places that were inhabitable and inhabited throughout the ice ages.\\n\\n====Early Spain and Roman Era====\\n{{see also|Roman Empire}}\\nThe earliest inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula we have any profound knowledge of were Iberians, Celts (related to the Gaulish, Britannic and Central European Celts in language and culture) and Basques. As most of these groups had little to no written records we only know of them due to the descriptions of the Greek, Punic and later Roman settlers and conquerors, who colonised Spain from the South starting in the 3rd century BC. [[Latin Europe|Roman culture]] lasted on the peninsula for roughly half a millennium, when in the age of migrations the Visigoths conquered the Roman province of ''Hispania''.\\n\\n====Visigoth Spain====\\n{{see also|Goths}}\\nMost inhabitants of the area kept speaking Latin or rather Latin-derived languages/dialects and only a handful of Germanic words entered the Spanish language (''\\\"ganso\\\"'' being the most commonplace). Soon after their conquest, the Visigoths formed a number of rival \\\"kingdoms\\\" and petty noble states in almost constant conflict in ever-shifting shaky alliances with or against one another, giving rise to constant wars.\\n\\n====Muslim conquest and \\\"al-Andalus\\\"====\\n[[File:Alhambra palace and surrounding area.jpg|thumbnail|Alhambra and the city of Granada]]\\n{{see also|Islamic Golden Age|Al-Andalus}}\\nIn 711 one Visigoth ruler apparently called for the Umayyad Muslims to help in his fight against a rival. (Which one is unclear, as the historical records for this era in Spain are scarce and there are for example no contemporary Muslim sources whatsoever.) This proved more successful than he could have imagined, and by the end of the 8th century most of the peninsula was in Muslim hands. While the almost 800 years of divided rule by Christian and Muslim rulers on the Iberian peninsula was by no means peaceful, the modern narrative of a somehow concerted effort to \\\"regain\\\" the \\\"lost lands\\\" for Christendom was never the first, second or any priority for the majority of the Christian rulers. As a matter of fact, many times Christian rulers entered into alliances with Muslim rulers against other Christian rulers and vice versa. While the situation for Muslims in Christian lands and vice versa and Jews in either depended very much on the mood of the ruler and could lie anywhere on a range from benevolent ignorance to murder and expulsion, religious minorities had it a lot better in Spain than in most of the rest of Europe at that time. In fact the Sephardi Jews (named after the Hebrew word for Spain) were at that time not only one of the most important groups inside Spain in terms of science and education, but also dominant among the [[Judaism|Jewish people, worldwide]]. During that time an estimated 90% of Jews were Sephardi. (In the 19th century, on the other hand, roughly 90% of Jews were Ashkenazim [German and Eastern European, and primarily Yiddish-speaking].)\\n\\nHowever, this period ended when through conquest and marriage the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon as well as a couple of minor Christian lands were united and their rulers started a war of conquest against the Muslim rulers. The union of the numerous Christian kingdoms is commemorated in the modern Spanish coat of arms, which is an amalgamation of the coats of arms of the four main kingdoms prior to the union, namely the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Le\\u00f3n and Navarre. In the process of re-conquering Spain, many of the great mosques and synagogues were desecrated and converted into Christian churches.\\n\\nSome of the most glorious historical attractions in Spain date from the period of Muslim rule, including '''The Mezquita''', built as the Great Mosque of [[C\\u00f3rdoba (city, Spain)|C\\u00f3rdoba]] and the '''Medina Azahara''', also in C\\u00f3rdoba and now in ruins but still visitable as such and built as the Madinat al-Zahra, the Palace of al-Andalus; and the '''Alhambra''' in [[Granada]], a splendid, intact palace. There are also two synagogues still standing that were built during the era of Muslim Spain: '''Santa Mar\\u00eda la Blanca''' in [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]] and the '''Synagogue of C\\u00f3rdoba''', in the Old City.\\n\\n====Reconquista and Imperial era====\\n{{seealso|Age of Discovery}}\\nThis so-called \\\"reconquista\\\" was completed in 1492 with the fall of Granada, and all Jews were forced to leave Spain or convert that year; by 1526, all Spanish Muslims had suffered the same fate. 1492 also marks the point when Spain started to become the world's strongest empire with territories in [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], [[Africa]], and the [[Philippines]] (named after Spanish king Felipe II). The \\\"new Christians\\\" as they were called were often not sincere in their largely forced conversions and to ensure religious \\\"purity\\\", the notorious Spanish inquisition was set up. <!-- which nobody expected!--> Genetic studies made in modern times suggest that a large percentage of modern Spaniards have at least partial Jewish and/or Muslim ancestry, which might surprise some, as the concept of being a \\\"true Christian\\\" (rather than a \\\"converso\\\") soon began to get hereditary overtones, with the expulsion of all the descendants of forced converts from Islam in 1609.\\n\\nUnder the House of Habsburg, Spain became a personal union with the [[Austrian Empire]], and reached its height of power in Europe during the 16th and early 17th centuries, controlling much of [[Benelux]] and [[Italy]]. Spain was weakened as the House of Habsburg lost the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1648. Spain was further weakened by ineffective governance, religious intolerance that drove out the erstwhile prosperous and productive Jewish and Muslim minorities and hampered free inquiry and - paradoxically - Latin American gold and silver that devalued the currency and still couldn't cover war expenses. The Spanish Habsburgs - prone to marrying inside the family, thus accumulating inheritable diseases - died out when Charles II was unable to produce an heir, which like many of his other afflictions was likely a result of incest. Most powers of Europe fought for the possibility to put one of their own on the Spanish throne, with the House of Bourbon doing it. The Bourbons would attempt a reform of their many domains gaining some successes but enraging those who had held onto old privileges of local autonomy or feudal rights.\\n\\nThe colonisation of Central and South America and of [[Mexico]] was particularly profound, with the deaths of millions of native people through disease, war and outright murder as the Spanish sought riches in these 'undiscovered' lands. Today many of the countries in this area are defined by Hispanic language and culture (Spanish is today the world's second most spoken native language after Mandarin and before English, and Catholicism dominates throughout the former Spanish colonies).\\n\\n====Crises of the 19th century====\\nWith the death of Charles III in 1788, Spain lost its last monarch with will, energy and capability for a long time at a crucial juncture - the French Revolution would break out the next year. His successor Charles IV tried at first to maintain some of his father's policies but ultimately saw more fun in hunting than politics. Soon politics in Spain would come to be dominated by Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy who was rumored to have an affair with the queen. Meanwhile, Charles' son, Ferdinand VII was chomping at the bit to replace his father as king, which earned him the contempt of the latter. In 1808 Ferdinand seemed to have briefly succeeded in replacing the hated Godoy and his father but Napoleon Bonaparte invited the two quarrelling kings to Bayonne under the pretext of mediating but forced both to abdicate in favor of his brother Joseph Bonaparte. Many among Spain's elites were having none of it and set up ''Juntas'' to maintain a government nominally loyal to Spanish monarchy. The liberal constitution of Cadiz 1812 was drafted in those years and as Ferdinand was willing to promise everyone everything to return to the throne, he came to be known as \\\"the Desired One\\\", with high hopes that he would rule as a liberal citizen-king under the constitution of Cadiz. Ferdinand never intended any such thing and his heavy-handed policies brought the wrath not only of his Spanish subjects but even of those ''Juntas'' in Latin America that had been set up without making up their mind whether to support a restoration of Bourbon rule or independence - only certain that they would oppose Napoleon and his regime. When Ferdinand died in 1833 he left a nominally absolute monarchy with an unhappy population which had lost most of its colonies to a not-yet three year old Isabella II. Immediately some hyper-conservative elements but also those in the Basque country who wanted back the old ''fuero'' autonomy refused to back Isabella's claim on account of her being female, giving birth to the \\\"Carlist\\\" movement.\\nThe 19th century saw independence movements fight back against the kingdom of Spain, with leaders such as Sim\\u00f3n Bol\\u00edvar and August\\u00edn de Iturbide successfully creating new independent nations throughout Latin America. By 1898 Spain lost the majority of its remaining territories during the Spanish-American War: it lost [[Cuba]] and then sold [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Guam]] to the [[United States]]. The war of 1898 was a huge shock to Spanish culture and shattered Spain's self-image of a first-rate power, and it thus inspired a whole literary movement known as the generation of '98. For much of this time, Spain was not really ''one'' realm so much as ''several'' realms which shared a monarch. While the monarch had broad powers, there was no such thing as \\\"absolute\\\" monarchy in Spain and the various regions - notably the Basque country - had numerous special privileges and autonomies granted either to \\\"the people\\\", a local lord or \\\"free men\\\". This proved complicated to resolve when Spain became a Republic and it is still an issue with which Spain is grappling in the 21st century.\\n[[File:Sagrada Familia Eixample from Montjuic.jpg|thumb|Sagrada Familia, the Gaudi masterpiece in the [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]] region of [[Barcelona]]]]\\n\\n====The 20th century====\\nSpain experienced a devastating civil war between 1936 and 1939 that killed half a million Spaniards and ushered in more than 30 years of dictatorship under Generalissimo Francisco Franco. The civil war began from a mostly failed coup in Spanish North Africa (today part of Morocco) against Spain's left-wing republican government supported by the popular front (a popular front was in those days a regime including communist, socialist, liberal, Christian Democrat and even conservative parties and originated in France as a response to fascism, though the parties in power in July 1936 were Izquierda Republicana and Uni\\u00f3n Republicana, two centre-left wing republican parties, supported by PSOE; the communist party had just 17 seats). The fascist side was led by a group of generals; however, some of them soon died in plane crashes or were pushed to the side by Franco. Although the League of Nations (a precursor of today's United Nations) attempted to make intervention impossible, Mussolini's Italy and Nazi Germany ignored this by aiding the nationalist (Franco) side, while the Soviet Union and to some extent Mexico provided aid to the Republican (popular front) side. The Republican side called for volunteers in the so-called \\\"international brigades\\\", and around 20,000 Brits, Americans, Frenchmen and even Germans joined the fight on their side. However, the Republican side was plagued by lack of weapons and ammunition (some of their rifles were produced in the 19th century), by infighting between communists and anarchists, and by Stalinist purges ordered by the super-paranoid supporters of Republican Spain in Moscow. As many people of that generation fought in the Spanish Civil War or covered it as \\u2013 often blatantly biased \\u2013 war correspondents (including George Orwell, Ernest Hemingway and later German chancellor Willy Brandt) there is a lot of well-written literature (and some films), which while not always historically accurate, manage to perfectly capture the spirit of vain idealism that made many of the interbrigadistas go to Spain in the first place. Just as the [[American Civil War]] gave a breakthrough for photojournalism, [[World War I]] for news radio and World War II for the newsreel, the Spanish Civil War made its mark on journalism, literature and arts. The Reina Sofia museum in Madrid has an exhibition for artistic expressions of the war, with Picasso's ''Guernica'' \\u2013 produced for the republican Spanish pavilion at the 1937 world exhibition in Paris \\u2013 as its centrepiece.\\n\\nThe war was won for Franco through superior fire-power and with military aid from the Nazis (including the war-crime of bombing [[Guernica]]). Franco managed to unify the not at all homogeneous nationalist forces behind his less-than-charismatic leadership and hold onto power through the [[World War II in Europe|Second World War]] (in which he stayed neutral) until his death. He was succeeded by King Juan Carlos. The Spanish Civil War is still in some sense an open wound as it was hardly ever talked about during the days of Franco's regime. To this day, conservatives and Catholics (the Republicans were pretty anti-clerical) are sometimes apologetic about Franco and the \\\"necessity\\\" of the war. Franco's legacy was that the historically important regional identities and languages (such as Catalan and Basque) were brutally suppressed and a policy of strong national identity under the Spanish/Castilian language was promoted. Many Republican soldiers and supported continued fighting until the mid 50s in the so-called maquis, in 1944 there was even an attempt to invade Spain from France through the Vall d'Aran in 1944 which was quickly suppressed by the Guardia Civil. Violent groups such as ETA (see below) started their activity in the 1960s during Franco's time, there was also an increasing protest movement in the last years of franquism. Franco oversaw Spain's rapid economic expansion with its industrialisation in the 1960s. Spain's messy divorce from its African colonies in the last years and days of Franco's life is also one of the reasons for the conflict in [[Western Sahara]], a former Spanish colony.\\n\\nFranco named Juan Carlos as his successor in 1969, with Juan Carlos being crowned king shortly after Franco's death. Shortly after King Juan Carlos \\u2013 to the surprise of many \\u2013 insisted on the country becoming a parliamentary democracy with a figurehead king as nominal head of state, right-wing generals tried to overthrow the nascent democracy on 23 February 1981 in what is now known as 23F. One of the most striking images of the coup was the general Tejero storming into the Congress of Deputies at the head of 200 Guardia Civil members and interrupting the vote to replace centre-left Adolfo Suarez with centre-right Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo for Prime Minister. The coup failed mostly due to lack of popular support and because the king \\u2013 in his capacity of commander-in-chief \\u2013 appeared on television in full uniform to order the soldiers back into their barracks, thus throwing his lot in with democracy. This resulted in a lot of support for the king personally even among otherwise republican-inclined Spaniards for most of his reign. However, the monarchy is rather unpopular among the autonomist or independist movements of Catalonia or the Basque Country. Spain entered NATO (though not the EU or any of its predecessors) in 1982, which Calvo-Sotelo. The ruling centre-right party UCD under Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo badly misjudged the Andalusian desire for regional self-government and thus lost the 1982 election, in one of the biggest popular vote landslides in any modern democracy, to the leftist PSOE. This led to the formation of Partido Popular (PP) from the rubble left behind by the temporary collapse of the centre-right. PSOE was led at that time by the relatively youthful Andalusian Felipe Gonz\\u00e1lez and enjoys a strong basis of support in Andalusia to this day.\\n\\nWith the peaceful transition to democracy after Franco's death, the restrictions on regional identity were lifted, with autonomy granted to several regions, and the regional languages gaining co-official status in their respective areas. The nature of the transition meant that there was little justice for those who had suffered under the Franco dictatorship and divisions still remain.\\n\\nThe Basque Country in Spain's north that had begun violent resistance in 1959 against Franco continued its campaign of bombings and assassinations into the democratic era with the terrorist ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna; Basque for Basque Country and Freedom) group, despite the region having been provided with a high degree of autonomy. The group declared a ceasefire in 2011 and the armed struggle appears over for the time being. Even in the \\\"democratic\\\" 1980s, (under longtime Prime minister Felipe Gonz\\u00e1lez [PSOE 1982\\u20131996]) the Spanish government responded with methods that are now known to have included \\\"death squadrons\\\" to combat terrorism.\\n\\n====21st century====\\nIn the 2000s there was more economic expansion and a housing price boom that subsequently collapsed, leaving Spain with high unemployment and economic difficulties. The economically important Catalan region has become louder in its demands for independence. In 2017/18 this conflict erupted as the central government had worked to annul key aspects of a more extensive statute of autonomy while parts of the Catalan parliament held an independence referendum, deemed \\\"illegal\\\" by opponents of independence. The central government cracked down heavily on the independence movement and several people involved in the referendum were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.\\n\\n====Migration====\\nSpain holds a historical attachment to its neighbours on the Iberian Peninsula, [[Andorra]] and [[Portugal]], to its former colonies, to former citizens and their descendants, and to a special category of former citizens, namely Sephardic Jews.\\n\\nThe population of Spain is growing in large part due to migration by people from relatively poor or politically unstable areas of Latin America, such as [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]] [[Nicaragua]], [[Peru]] or [[Venezuela]]; other parts of Europe, especially Eastern Europe; and Africa and Asia, particularly areas that have a historical or linguistic attachment to Spain. There is also an important segment of immigration that consists mainly of retired people, and people running businesses for them and foreign tourists, coming from wealthier European countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Benelux]] and the [[Nordic countries]], established all along the Mediterranean shore, especially in the [[Costa Blanca]], [[Costa del Sol]], the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Balearic Islands]], particularly in the summer months.\\n\\nInternally there have always been migrations from poorer rural areas (such as Andalusia) to the cities and to jobs in construction and tourism. Due to the economic crisis of the 2000s and 2010s, youth unemployment has risen to unbearable levels in the 50% range and quite a number of young people have semi-permanently fled the country to other European Union countries such as Germany to study, work or do internships either until things get better in Spain or forever. In the latter half of the 2010s there were tentative signs of economic improvement with some economic emigrants returning to Spain.\\n\\n===Tourist information ===\\n* [https://www.spain.info/ Tourist information website] of the Spanish government.\\n\\n==Talk==\\n{{see also|Spanish phrasebook}}\\n\\n{{infobox|I'm so pregnant|Many English words have their origins in Latin, which makes it easy for English speakers to guess the meanings of many Spanish words.

Many people, especially outside Castile, prefer to call it '''Castilian''' (''castellano'').\\n\\nHowever, there are a number of languages (Catalan, Basque, Galician, Asturian, etc.) spoken in various parts of Spain. Some of these languages are dominant and co-official in their respective regions, though most people will be bilingual in their local language and Spanish. Catalan, Basque and Galician are recognised as official languages according to the Spanish constitution. With the exception of Basque (whose origins are still debated), the languages of the Iberian Peninsula are part of the Romance family and are fairly easy to pick up if you know Castilian well.\\n\\n* '''[[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]]''' (Catalan: ''catal\\u00e0'', Castilian: ''catal\\u00e1n''), a distinct language similar to Castilian but more closely related to the Oc branch of the Romance Languages and considered by many to be part of a dialect continuum spanning across Spain, France, and Italy and including the other langues d'oc such as Proven\\u00e7al, Be\\u00e0rnais, Limousin, Auvernhat and Ni\\u00e7ard. Various dialects are spoken in the northeastern region of [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], and [[Valencia (region)|Valencia]] (where it is often referred to as ''Valenci\\u00e0''), east of [[Aragon]], as well as neighbouring [[Andorra]] and southern France. To a casual listener, Catalan superficially appears to be a cross of Castilian, French and Portuguese and though it does share features of all three, it is a separate language.\\n* '''[[Galician phrasebook|Galician]]''' (Galician: ''galego'', Castilian: ''gallego''), very closely related to Portuguese, Galician is spoken in [[Galicia]] and the western portions of [[Asturias]] and [[Leon (Spain)|Le\\u00f3n]]. Galician predates Portuguese and is deemed one of the four main dialects of the Galician-Portuguese language family group which includes Brazilian, Southern Portuguese, Central Portuguese, and Galician. While the Portuguese consider it a dialect of Portuguese, Galicians consider their language separate.\\n* '''[[Basque phrasebook|Basque]]''' (Basque: ''euskara'', Castilian: ''vasco''), a language unrelated to Castilian (or any other known language in the world), is spoken in the three provinces of the [[Basque Country]], on the two adjacent provinces on the French side of the Spain-French border, and in Navarre. Basque is considered a language isolate unrelated to any Romance, Indo-European, or even any known language, save for a weak theory that Basque could be related to Aquitanian.\\n* '''[[Asturiano phrasebook|Asturiano]]''' (Asturiano: ''asturianu'', Castilian: ''asturiano'', also known as ''bable''), spoken in the province of [[Asturias]], where it enjoys semi-official protection. It was also spoken in rural parts of [[Le\\u00f3n (Spain)|Le\\u00f3n]], [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]], [[Salamanca]], in a few villages in Portugal (where it is called Mirandes) and in villages in the extreme north of [[Extremadura]]. While the constitution of Spain explicitly protects Basque, Balearic-Catalan-Valencian under the term Catalan, Galician, and Castilian, it does not explicitly protect Asturian. Still, the province of Asturias explicitly protects it, and Spain implicitly protects it by not objecting before the Supreme Court.\\n* '''[[Aragonese phrasebook|Aragonese]]''' (Aragonese: ''aragon\\u00e9s'', Castilian: ''aragon\\u00e9s'', also known colloquially as ''fabla''), spoken in the north of [[Aragon]], and is not officially recognised. This language is close to Catalan (specially in [[Benasque]]) and to Castilian, with some Basque and Occitan (southern France) influences. Nowadays, only a few villages near the [[Pyrenees]] use the language vigorously, while most people mix it with Castilian in their daily speech.\\n* '''[[Aranese phrasebook|Aranese]]''' (Castilian: ''Aran\\u00e9s'', Catalan/Aranese Occitan: ''Aran\\u00e8s''), spoken in the Aran Valley and recognised as an official language of Catalonia (not of Spain), alongside Catalan and Castilian. This language is a variety of Gascon Occitan, and as such is very closely related to Proven\\u00e7al, Limousin, Languedoc, and Catalan.\\n\\nIn addition to the native languages, many languages such as English, [[French phrasebook|French]], and [[German phrasebook|German]] are commonly studied in school. However, Spaniards are not known for their proficiency in foreign languages, and it is very rare to find locals conversant in foreign languages outside of tourist establishments or major international hotels. Most establishments in Spain's important tourist industry, however, have staff members who speak a decent level of English, particularly in popular beach resorts such as those in the [[Costa del Sol]] where you will find people who are fluent in several languages, the most common ones being German and French. As [[Portuguese phrasebook|Portuguese]] and [[Italian phrasebook|Italian]] are closely related to Spanish, if you speak either of these languages, locals would be able to puzzle you out with some difficulty. German is spoken in some areas frequented by German tourists, such as Mallorca. In general, people who speak two national languages (e.g. Basque and Castilian or Catalan and Castilian) are more likely to speak a foreign language than monolingual Spanish speakers.\\n\\nCastilian Spanish differs from the '''Latin American Spanish''' varieties in pronunciation and grammar, although all Latin American varieties are easily understood by Spaniards and vice-versa. While the differences in spelling are virtually non-existent, the differences in vocabulary and pronunciation between Castilian Spanish and \\\"Latin American Spanish\\\" are arguably bigger than those between \\\"American\\\" and \\\"British\\\" English.\\n\\nFrench is the most widely understood foreign language in the northeast of Spain. The Basque region and northern Catalonia in particular have sizable populations that speak French.\\n\\nLocals will appreciate any attempts you make to speak their language. For example, know at least the Castilian for \\\"good morning\\\" (''buenos d\\u00edas'') and \\\"thank you\\\" (''gracias'').\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===Entry requirements===\\n{{infobox|Minimum validity of travel documents|* EU, EEA and Swiss citizens need only produce a passport or national identity card that is valid on the date of entry.\\n* Other nationals must produce a passport that is valid for the entirety of their stay in Spain.\\n* More information about the minimum validity of travel documents is on the [http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/MIAMI/en/InformacionParaExtranjeros/Pages/RequisitosDeEntrada.aspx Spanish government website].}}\\n{{Schengen}}\\n\\nIn addition, citizens of [[Andorra]] may enter and reside in Spain indefinitely without a visa.\\n\\nEU, EEA and Swiss nationals who enter Spain on a national identity card, who are under 18 years old and travelling without their parents are required to have written parental consent.\\n\\nCitizens of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Seychelles are permitted to work in Spain without the need to obtain a visa or any further authorisation for the period of their 90-day visa-free stay.

From neighbouring European countries, a drive with the car or a train ride is feasible; from a number of Mediterranean countries more or less [[Ferries in the Mediterranean|regular ferry connections]] are available; visitors from further away will probably be using air travel.\\n\\n===By plane===\\n[[File:Torre de control de Madrid-Barajas - 01.jpg|thumb|Control tower of [[Madrid\\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid-Barajas]]]]\\nSpain's flag carrier is '''[http://www.iberia.com Iberia]''', and its two other main airlines are '''[http://www.vueling.com Vueling]''' and '''[http://www.aireuropa.com Air Europa]'''. There are many airlines connecting from most European countries, Africa, the Americas and Asia. Virtually all European low cost carriers provide frequent services to Spain including: [https://www.tui.co.uk/flight/ '''TUI Airways'''], '''[http://www.easyjet.com EasyJet]''', '''[http://www.ryanair.com Ryanair]''', '''[http://wizzair.com Wizz Air]''' and '''[http://www.jet2.com Jet2.com]'''.\\n\\nThe busiest airports are [[Madrid\\u2013Barajas Airport]], [[Barcelona El Prat]], [[Palma de Mallorca#By plane|Palma de Mallorca]] and [[Malaga#By plane|Malaga]], followed by [[Seville#By plane|Seville]], [[Valencia#By plane|Valencia]], [[Bilbao#By plane|Bilbao]], [[Alicante#By plane|Alicante]] and [[Santiago de Compostela#By plane|Santiago de Compostela]].\\n\\nFor mainland Spain, Madrid Barajas ({{IATA|MAD}}), Barcelona ({{IATA|BCN}}) and Malaga ({{IATA|AGP}}) are your most likely ports of entry, as they have by far the highest number of international flights. For the islands, you will most likely directly arrive at an airport on the island, without connecting through another Spanish airport. If your destination does not have a direct flight, you can make use of Iberia's [[rail air alliance]] with Renfe. Searching for your destination directly on the Iberia website will give you flights with a connecting train service automatically.\\n\\nYou can also enter Spain by using an alternative airport not far away from the land border:\\n\\n* To the mainland's west: [[Porto#By plane|Porto]] ({{IATA|OPO}})\\n* To the mainland's south-west: [[Gibraltar#By plane|Gibraltar]] ({{IATA|GIB}}) and [[Faro#By plane|Faro]] ({{IATA|FAO}})\\n* To the mainlands's north: [[Biarritz]] ({{IATA|BIQ}}) and [[Perpignan]] ({{IATA|PGF}})\\n* To [[Ceuta]]: [[Tangier#By plane|Tangier]] ({{IATA|TNG}}) and [[T\\u00e9touan#By plane|T\\u00e9touan]] ({{IATA|TTU}})\\n* To [[Melilla]]: [[Nador#By plane|Nador]] ({{IATA|NDR}})\\n* To [[Lanzarote]]'s south: [[Fuerteventura#By plane|Fuerteventura]] ({{IATA|FUE}})\\n* To [[Fuerteventura]]'s north: [[Lanzarote]] ({{IATA|ACE}})\\n\\n===By train===\\n{{see also|rail travel in Europe}}\\n[[File:AVE in spain.jpg|thumb|AVE in Spain (Spanish High Speed)]]\\n\\nThe train system in Spain is modern and reliable, most of the trains are brand new and the punctuality rate is one of the highest in Europe, the only problem is that not all the populated areas have a train station; sometimes small towns don't have one, in those cases you need to take a bus. Another issue with the Spanish Rail network is that the lines are disposed in a radial way so almost all the lines head to Madrid. That's why sometimes travelling from one city to another geographically close to it might take longer by train than by bus if they are not on the same line. Always check whether the bus or the train is more convenient. The Spanish [[high speed rail]] system is, however, more reliable than that of - say - Germany, because the gauge of traditional and high speed trains is different and thus high speed lines are only used by high speed passenger trains meaning fewer delays due to congested lines or technical problems. All lines that cross the border into France have either a break of gauge (thus making changing train or a lengthy gauge change necessary) or are high speed, thus making the high speed trains the vastly preferable option to cross the border. Trains between Barcelona and France are operated jointly by '''SNCF''' and '''renfe''' and both sell tickets for any international train on that route. Spain has numerous rail links with neighbouring Portugal, none of them high speed. There are only three rail links with France, one at [[Hendaye]] on a traditional line requiring a break of gauge, a connection used for local traffic near Latour de Carol (this is the closest rail line to [[Andorra]]) and one near [[Figueres]] for high speed trains. The former two see the occasional [[sleeper train]] while the latter sees the vast majority of passenger travel and all high speed trains. The former link through the Pyrenees near [[Canfranc]] has been abandoned but the former border station at Canfranc is still served from the Spanish site and worth a visit if you're a railway enthusiast or history buff.\\n\\nLike many European countries there has been a separation between running trains and running infrastructure (including stations). The infrastructure company is called [https://www.adif.es/inicio adif] and their website has train operator independent information about their stations including platform and departure times. They also have a more travel focussed smart-phone app. Note that local trains and regional/longer distance services are listed separately.\\n\\n===By bus===\\n\\nGerman player [http://www.flixbus.de Flixbus] offer international routes to/from Spanish destinations. Spanish operators with international connections include [https://www.alsa.es/en/our-destinations/international Alsa] and [http://www.linebus.es/ Linebus]. Generally speaking the buses will be reasonably save and may even have WiFi or electric outlets at your seat, but if your main concern is anything but cost, opt for a train or plane instead as the former is both vastly more comfortable and faster and the latter is still a lot faster and can even be cheaper, if you manages to travel on carry-on only. Buses generally have greater luggage allowances than the airlines, but then again, you'd have the same advantage taking the train.\\n\\n===By boat===\\nSpain is a popular Cruise destination being some of is main cruise ports: [[Barcelona]], [[Bilbao]], [[Valencia]],  [[Palma de Mallorca]] or [[Malaga]]\\n\\nFrom the UK, [http://www.brittanyferries.com/ Brittany Ferries] offers services from [[Portsmouth]] and [[Plymouth (England)|Plymouth]] to [[Santander]] and from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Bilbao]].

Long-distance trains always run on time, but be aware that short-distance trains (called ''Cercan\\u00edas'') can have some delays, from ten to twenty minutes.  To be safe, always take the train before the one you need. It also runs former FEVE narrow-gauge trains which mainly run near the northern Atlantic coast (from Ferrol to Bilbao). Buying tickets online with a foreign credit card is usually possible, however, those with a PayPal account may find it easier to pay using the website. Renfe also operates the '''AVE''' [[High-speed rail|high speed trains]], whose network radiates out of Madrid to the major cities along the coasts - Spain boasts the second-longest high speed network (behind [[China]]) and has constructed a lot of new lines until the economic downturn at the end of the 2000s. The AVE is easily the fastest option wherever it goes (faster even than flying in most cases) but can be on the expensive side. '''Intercity''' trains are slower but often substantially cheaper, and much more comfortable than the bus.

You can also see what is all available on [http://www.movelia.es Movelia.es] or see \\\"By bus\\\" under \\\"Getting in\\\" or \\\"Getting Around\\\" in the article for a particular autonomous community region, province or locale.   It is usually not necessary or more advantageous to book tickets in advance as one can show up and get on the next available bus. Most bus companies can be booked in advance online. however English translation on their websites is patchy at best.\\n\\n===By boat===\\nRegular '''ferries''' travel from mainland Spain to the [[Balearic Islands]] (3-7h) and [[Canary Islands]] (36-40h).

The Canaries are served from [[Huelva]] and [[C\\u00e1diz|Cadiz]].\\n\\nWith a '''private yacht''' you can enjoy gorgeous scenery and distance yourself from the inevitable crowds of tourists that flock to these destinations. May is a particularly pleasant time to charter in the regions of Costa Brava, Costa Blanca and the Balearic Islands as the weather is good and the crowds have yet to descend. The summer months of July and August are the hottest and tend to have lighter winds. There is no low season for the Canary Islands, as the weather resembles springtime all year round.\\n\\nIf you would like to bareboat anywhere in Spain, including the Balearic or Canary Islands, a US Coast Guard License is the only acceptable certification needed by Americans to bareboat. For everyone else, a RYA Yacht Master Certification or International Certificate of Competence will normally do.\\n\\nAlthough a skipper may be required, a hostess/chef may or may not be necessary. Dining out is strong part of Spanish custom and tradition. If you are planning on docking in a port and exploring fabulous bars and restaurants a hostess/cook may just be useful for serving drinks and making beds. Extra crew can take up valuable room on a tight ship.\\n\\n=== By car ===\\n{{see also|Driving in Spain}}\\nIn major cities like [[Madrid]] or [[Barcelona]] and in mid-sized ones like [[San Sebastian]], moving around by car is expensive and nerve-wracking. Fines for improper parking are uncompromising (\\u20ac85 and up). Access by car has been made more difficult by municipal policies in Barcelona and Madrid in the 2010s. The positive effects on the urban fabric of those policies have proven widely popular, so expect more of this.\\n[[File:Red espa\\u00f1ola de autopistas y autov\\u00edas2.PNG|thumb|Spanish network of motorways]]\\nHaving a driving map is essential - many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable).\\n\\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to move from one city to another every other day, ideally if you don't plan to park overnight in large cities. It also doesn't hurt that the scenery is beautiful and well worth a drive. With a good public transport network that connects to (almost) all points of interest for travellers, you might ask yourself whether driving is really worth the cost and the hassle, as you are often much faster by train than by car.\\n\\nThere are two types of highway in Spain: ''autopistas'', or motorways, and ''autov\\u00edas'', which are more akin to expressways. Most autopistas are toll roads while autov\\u00edas are generally free of charge. In some autonomous communities whether a highway is tolled depends on whether the central or regional government built and operates them. To a foreigner the system can seem rather confusing. <!--is there signage at least?--> Tolls often work out to \\\"odd\\\" Euro amounts leading you with a lot of copper coins if you pay cash. Speed limits range from 50&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph) in towns to 90&nbsp;km/h on rural roads, 100&nbsp;km/h on roads and 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph) on autopistas and autov\\u00edas. Starting from May 2021 all roads with only one lane per direction inside built up areas will have a blanket speed limit of {{kmh|30}}.\\n\\nSpaniards are somewhat notorious for seeing traffic infractions such as speeding, second row parking or red light infractions as \\\"minor\\\", but the government is increasingly cracking down on this kind of behavior and police will have a field day writing a ticket to a foreigner who doesn't speak the language.\\n\\nGasoline/petrol costs in the range of \\u20ac1.60/L in Dec 2023, and diesel costs \\u20ac1.55/L.

Sometimes you can wait many hours. Try to speak with people at gas stations, parking lots, etc. They are scared and suspicious, but when you make them feel that they don't need to be afraid, they gladly accept you and mostly also show their generosity.\\n\\nIn the south of Spain, in and around the Alpujarras, hitchhiking is very common and it is also very easy to get a ride. As long as you can speak a bit of Spanish and don't look too dirty or frightening, you should be able to get a ride moderately easily.\\n\\n=== By bicycle ===\\n[[File:Bicisvalenbisi.jpg|thumb|Bike rental station in Valencia]]\\n\\nSpain is a suitable country for cycling, and it is possible to see many cyclists in some of the cities. Cycling lanes are available in a large part of North-Easter Catalonia, and elsewhere in mid-sized and large cities, although they are not comparable in number to what you can find in for example central Europe.\\n\\nDepending on where you are in Spain, you could face a very mountainous area. Much of central Spain is very flat, though elevated, but towards the coast the landscape is often very hilly, especially in the north. Consider using an E-bike if your visit involves going by hilltops and you aren't used to that kind of biking or don't like the effort needed.\\n\\nThere are several options for touring in Spain by bicycle: guided or supported tours, rent bicycles in Spain or bring your own bike, or any combination. Supported tours are ubiquitous on the web. For unsupported tours a little Spanish helps a lot. Shoulder seasons avoid extremes of temperature and ensure hotel availability in non-tourist areas. Good hotels are \\u20ac35\\u201345 in the interior, breakfast usually included. ''Men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' meals are \\u20ac8\\u201310 eating where the locals eat. Secondary roads are usually well paved and have good shoulders, and as a rule Spanish drivers are careful and courteous around touring cyclists. Road signs are usually very good and easy to follow.\\n\\nMost municipalities in Spain, towns and cities are modernising their streets to introduce special lanes for bicycles. Bike share systems with usually quite reasonable prices are also being installed in cities throughout the country.\\n\\n=== By e-hailing ===\\nSeveral cities in Spain are covered by Uber, Cabify, Bolt, Free Now and Pide Taxi{{go|lastedit=2024-05-19}}\\n\\n=== By taxi ===\\nAll the major cities in Spain are served by taxis, which are a convenient, if somewhat expensive way to get around. That being said, taxis in Spain are more reasonably priced than those in say, the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Japan]]. Most taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign languages, so it would be necessary to have the names and/or addresses of your destinations written in Spanish to show your taxi driver. Likewise, get your hotel's business card to show your taxi driver in case you get lost.\\n\\nAll taxis should have a visible fare table. You may be offered a fixed price to go from an airport to a city, but in most cases, the taxi driver will be earning more money than with the metered fare.\\n\\nMany taxi drivers will demand a tip from foreign customers and for airport drives. The tip is in no way mandatory. You may round up to the nearest euro though, see also [[#Tipping|Tipping]] below.\\n\\n==See==\\nThe most popular beaches are the ones along the Mediterranean coast, in the Balearic Islands and in the Canary Islands.

The country thus is blessed with a fantastic collection of historical landmarks \\u2014 in fact, it has the second largest number of UNESCO Heritage Sites and the largest number of World Heritage Cities of any nation in the world.\\n\\nIn the south of Spain, Andalusia holds many reminders of old Spain. '''[[Cadiz]]''' is regarded as one of the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in western Europe, with remnants of the Roman settlement that once stood here. Nearby, '''[[Ronda]]''' is a beautiful town atop steep cliffs and noted for its gorge-spanning bridge and the oldest bullring in Spain. '''[[Cordoba (city, Spain)|Cordoba]]''' and '''[[Granada (Spain)|Granada]]''' hold the most spectacular reminders of the nation's Muslim past, with the red-and-white striped arches of the Mezquita in Cordoba and the stunning Alhambra palace perched on a hill above Granada. '''[[Seville]]''', the cultural centre of Andalusia, has a dazzling collection of sights built when the city was the main port for goods from the Americas, the grandest of which being the city's cathedral, the largest in the country.\\n\\nMoving north across the plains of La Mancha into Central Spain, picturesque '''[[Toledo]]''' stands as perhaps ''the'' historical centre of the nation, a beautiful medieval city sitting atop a hill that once served as the capital of Spain before Madrid was built. North of Madrid and an easy day-trip from the capital city is '''[[El Escorial]]''', once the centre of the Spanish empire during the time of the Inquisition, and '''[[Segovia]]''', noted for its spectacular Roman aqueduct which spans one of the city's squares.\\n\\nFurther north in Castile-Leon is '''[[Salamanca]]''', known for its famous university and abundance of historic architecture. Galicia in northwestern Spain is home to '''[[Santiago de Compostela]]''', the end point of the old [[Way of St. James]] (''Camino de Santiago'') pilgrimage route and the supposed burial place of St. James, with perhaps the most beautiful cathedral in all of Spain at the heart of its lovely old town. Northeastern Spain has a couple of historical centres to note: '''[[Zaragoza]]''', with Roman, Muslim, medieval and Renaissance buildings from throughout its two thousand years of history, and '''[[Barcelona]]''' with its pseudo-medieval [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Barri G\\u00f2tic]] neighbourhood.\\n\\nBe prepared to have your luggage scanned airport style at the entrance of most museums. There's usually a locker where you can (or must) leave your bags.\\n\\n===Art museums===\\n[[File:Hemispheric - Valencia, Spain - Jan 2007.jpg|thumb|L'Hemisf\\u00e8ric, in The City of Arts and Sciences (Spanish: Ciudad de Las Artes y Las Ciencias) (Valencia)]]\\nSpain has played a key role in Western art, heavily influenced by French and Italian artists but very distinct in its own regard, owing to the nation's history of Muslim influence, Counter-Reformation climate and, later, the hardships from the decline of the Spanish empire, giving rise to such noted artists like El Greco, Diego Vel\\u00e1zquez and Francisco Goya. In the last century, Spain's unique position in Europe brought forth some of the leading artists of the Modernist and Surrealist movements, most notably the famed Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dal\\u00ed.\\n[[File:Museo Guggenheim con el puente de la Salve en primer plano.jpg|thumb|Guggenheim Museum with Salve Bridge in the foreground (Bilbao)]]\\nToday, Spain's two largest cities hold the lion's share of Spain's most famous artworks. Madrid's [[Madrid#Museum Triangle|Museum Triangle]] is home to the '''Museo del Prado''', the largest art museum in Spain with many of the most famous works by El Greco, Vel\\u00e1zquez, and Goya as well as some notable works by Italian, Flemish, Dutch and German masters. Nearby sits the '''Reina Sof\\u00eda''', most notable for holding Picasso's ''Guernica'' but also containing a number of works by Dal\\u00ed and other Modernist, Surrealist and abstract painters. The Prado goes back to the former royal collection and the Reina Sofia Museum is named for King Juan Carlos' wife, in practice the dividing line between the two is largely one of era, with anything made roughly after the birth of Picasso found in the Reina Sofia and everything else in the Prado.\\n\\n[[Barcelona]] is renowned for its stunning collection of modern and contemporary art and architecture. This is where you will find the '''Picasso Museum''', which covers the artist's early career quite well, and the architectural wonders of '''Antoni Gaudi''', with their twisting organic forms that are a delight to look at.\\n\\nOutside of Madrid and Barcelona, the art museums quickly dwindle in size and importance, although there are a couple of worthy mentions that should not be overlooked. Many of El Greco's most famous works lie in '''[[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]]''', an easy day trip from Madrid. ''The Disrobing of Christ'', perhaps El Greco's most famous work, sits in the cathedral, but you can also find work by him in one of the small art museums around town. [[Bilbao]] in the Basque Country of northern Spain is home to a spectacular '''Guggenheim Museum''' designed by Frank Gehry that has put the city on the map. A day trip from Barcelona is the town of [[Figueres]], noted for the '''Salvador Dal\\u00ed Museum''', designed by the Surrealist himself. [[M\\u00e1laga]] in the south is Picasso's city of birth, and is also home to two museums dedicated to his life and works.\\n\\n===Archaeological sites===\\n* Ampurias, excavations of a Greek and Roman town, Roman basilica, temples of Asclepios and Serapis, (between Gerona and Figueras, Catalonia)\\n* Antequetera, La Menga and Viera dolmens,\\n* Calatrava la Nueva, well preserved medieval castle,\\n* Calatrava la Vieja, remains of the Arab town, castle of the order of Calatrava,\\n* Clunia, Roman town with forum, shops, temple, public bath houses and Roman villa,\\n* Fraga, Roman villa, Bronze Age settlements,\\n* Gormaz, Arab castle,\\n* Italica, Roman town with amphitheatre, city walls, House of the Exedra, House of the Peacocks, Baths of the Moorish Queen, House of the Hylas, temple complex (near Sevilla),\\n* M\\u00e9rida, Roman city, Roman bridge, Amphitheatre, Hippodrome, House of the Amphitheatre, House of the Mithraeum with mosaics, aquaeducts, museum\\n* San Juan de los Banos, Visigoth church (between Burgos and Valladolid),\\n* San Pedro de la Nave, Visigoth church (near Zamora),\\n* Santa Maria de Melque, Visigoth church,\\n* Segobriga (Cabeza del Griego), Roman town, Visigoth church, museum (between Madrid and Albacete)\\n* Tarragona, Roman town with \\u201cCyclopean wall\\u201d, amphitheatre, hippodrome, form and triumphal arch,\\n\\n===Sports===\\n====Football====\\n{{see also|Association football in Europe}}\\nSpain's '''[http://www.laliga.es/en La Liga]''' is one of the strongest association football leagues in the world, boasting world-class teams like '''[http://www.realmadrid.com/en Real Madrid]''' and '''[https://www.fcbarcelona.com/ FC Barcelona]''' that play to sold-out crowds on a weekly basis. The rivalry between the two aforementioned clubs, known as '''''El Cl\\u00e1sico''''', is undoubtedly one of the most intense in the world as a result of the long history of political conflict behind it. Other noteworthy clubs include Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid, Valencia, Athletic Bilbao, and Sevilla. The Spanish national team is also one of the strongest in the world, being able to draw the best players from its league. It long had a reputation of always failing to win big games, but this reputation has been pretty much shattered by its wins in the 2008 and 2012 European Championships as well as the 2010 World Cup.\\n\\n====Basketball====\\nSpain also has a strong basketball tradition, with Spanish clubs generally doing well in European competition, and the Spanish national team also being one of the best in Europe. Many of the top football clubs in Spain also have basketball teams, and as with their football counterparts, both Real Madrid Baloncesto and FC Barcelona B\\u00e0squet are among Europe's most successful basketball teams.\\n\\n====Handball====\\n{{see also|Handball in Europe}}\\nSpain is among the most successful Handball nations on earth, although it may not always reach the level of play of some Nordic or ex-Yugoslavian countries or Germany.

There's a tradition in Spain to eat grapes as the clock counts down the New Year, one grape for each of the last 12 seconds before midnight. For this, even small packs of grapes (exactly 12 grapes per pack) are sold in supermarkets before New Year.\\n\\nLa Puerta del Sol, is the venue for the New Year's party in Spain. At 23:59 sound \\\"los cuartos (In Spanish)\\\" some bells announcing that it will begin to sound the 12 chimes (campanadas in Spanish). While sounding \\\"los cuartos\\\", moves down from the top chime of the clock, with the same purpose as \\\"los cuartos\\\" sound will indicate that \\\"las campanadas\\\". That will sound at 24:00 and that indicate the start of a new year. During each chime must eat a grape, according to tradition. Between each chime, there is a time span of three seconds.\\n\\n\\\"Las Campanadas\\\", are broadcast live on the main national TV channels, as in the rest of Spain, people are still taking grapes from home or on giant screens installed in major cities, following the chimes from the Puerta del Sol in Madrid.\\n[[File:Nochevieja puertadelsol 2006.jpg|thumb|Start the New Year in La Puerta del Sol (Madrid)]]\\nAfter ringing \\\"las campanadas\\\", starts a fireworks extravaganza.\\nThis is a famous party in Spain and is a great time to enjoy because show is secured in the centre of the capital of Spain.\\n\\n===Outdoor activities===\\n* '''Canyoning''': see [[Canyoning#Spain|Spain section in the Canyoning article]]\\n* '''Climbing''' in: [[Los Mallos]] ([[Aragon]]) and [[Siurana]] (near [[Barcelona]])\\n* '''Football''' (soccer): The most popular sport in Spain, with both the Spanish league and national team being among the strongest in the world.\\n* '''Whitewater sports''' in: [[Campo]], [[Murillo de Gallego]] ([[Aragon]])\\n* '''Hiking''' in Galicia\\n* '''Downhill skiing''': There are a lot of downhill skiing resorts in Spain.\\n\\nSkiing in the northern region of Spain\\n\\n===Scuba diving===\\nFor a treat, try Costa Brava and the world renowned Canary Islands.\\n\\n==Work==\\nIf you are a citizen of an [[European Union#EEA|EEA]] country, Switzerland or Andorra, you may work in Spain without any restrictions whatsoever (see [[European Union#Work]]). Everyone else requires a work permit to work in Spain.\\n\\nEmployment matters are highly sensitive in Spain, especially for Spanish citizens. The country has a high level of unemployment (13.5% as of March 2022) and for a developed country, Spain's economy is notoriously fragile. The country has long suffered from high levels of unemployment and many Spaniards have emigrated to other countries in search of better opportunities.\\n\\nTourism is the country's most important economic sector, and foreigners may be able to find jobs there, but it was badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nSpain has a sunny climate and is one of Europe's largest agricultural exporters. Farmers are often looking for temporary workers, but this means really hard work and miserable pay.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n===Money===\\n{{Exchange rate euros}}\\n{{Euro}}\\n[[File:Banco de Espa\\u00f1a (Madrid) 06.jpg|thumb|Bank of Spain]]\\n\\n\\u20ac500 banknotes are not accepted in many stores&mdash;always have alternative banknotes.\\n\\n====Money exchange====\\nDo not expect anybody to accept currencies other than euros, or to be willing to exchange currency. Exceptions are shops and restaurants in airports, which will generally accept at least US dollars \\u2013 at a bad exchange rate.\\n\\nBanks are the main places to exchange money. However, some banks may only exchange money for those with an account there.\\n\\nCurrency exchanges, once a common sight, have all but disappeared since the introduction of the euro. Again, international airports are an exception to this rule; another exception is tourist districts in the large cities (Barcelona, Madrid).\\n\\n====Credit and debit cards====\\nCredit and debit cards are widely accepted.\\n\\nSome Spanish stores will ask for ID before accepting your credit card. Some stores may not accept a foreign driving licence or ID card, and you may need to show your passport. This measure is designed to help reduce credit card fraud.\\n\\n====ATM====\\nMost ATMs will allow you to withdraw money with your credit card. There is a fee in addition to what your bank charges you of about \\u20ac2-7 (Feb 2023), except with Unicaja Banco machines. After advising you of the fee, you may choose whether to continue. ATMs are abundant: You can just check the fees of 2-3 ATMs around and pick the one with the lowest fee.\\n\\n* Banc Sabadell - \\u20ac4.5 (2025-02)\\n* BBVA - \\u20ac7 (2025-03)\\n* Caixabank - \\u20ac7 (2025-02)\\n* Ibercaja - \\u20ac0 (2025-03)\\n* Santander - \\u20ac7 (2025-03)\\n\\n===Tipping===\\n[[Tipping]], or \\\"propina\\\" in Spanish, is not mandatory nor considered customary in Spain unless there was something absolutely exceptional about the service. As a result, you may find that waiters are not as attentive or courteous as you may be used to since they don't work for tips.  If you choose to tip, the tip amount in restaurants depends on your economic status, the locale and type of establishment. If you feel that you have experienced good service then leave some loose change on the table - possibly \\u20ac1  or \\u20ac2. If you don't, it is no big deal.\\n\\nBars expect only tourists, particularly American tourists, to leave a tip. They are aware that it is customary in the United States to leave a tip for every drink or meal. It is rare to see anyone other than Americans tipping in Spain. In major resorts tipping may be common; look around at other diners to assess if tipping is appropriate.\\n\\nOutside the restaurant business, some service providers, such as taxi drivers, hairdressers and hotel personnel may expect a tip in an upscale setting.\\n\\n===Business hours===\\nMost businesses (including most shops, but not restaurants) close in the afternoons around 13:30/14:00 and reopen for the evening around 16:30/17:00. Exceptions are large malls or major chain stores.\\n\\nFor most Spaniards, lunch is the main meal of the day and you will find bars and restaurants open during this time. On Saturdays, businesses often do not reopen in the evening and almost everywhere is closed on Sundays. The exception is the month of December, where most shops in Madrid and Barcelona will be open as per on weekdays on Sundays to cash in on the festive season. Also, many public offices and banks do not reopen in the evenings even on weekdays, so if you have any important business to take care of, be sure to check hours of operation.\\n\\nIf you plan to spend whole day shopping in small shops, the following rule of thumb can work: a closed shop should remind it's also time for your own lunch. And when you finish your lunch, some shops will be likely open again.\\n[[File:Gran V\\u00eda (Madrid) 25.jpg|thumb|Gran V\\u00eda of Madrid, is a perfect place for shopping]]\\n\\n===Shopping===\\n====Designer brands====\\nBesides well-known mass brands which are known around the world (Zara, Mango, Bershka, Camper, Desigual), Spain has many designer brands which are more hard to find outside Spain\\u2014and may be worth looking for if you shop for designer wear while travelling. Some of these brands include:\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Custo Barcelona | url=https://custo.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n|lastedit=2023-12-26| content=Headquartered in [[Barcelona]], has stores in [[Bilbao]], [[Ibiza]], [[La Coruna]], [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], [[Le\\u00f3n (Spain)|Le\\u00f3n]], [[Madrid]], [[Marbella]], [[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Salamanca]], [[Tenerife]].\\n}}\\n\\n====Chains====\\n* {{buy\\n| name=El Corte Ingles | alt= | url=http://elcorteingles.es | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Major national chain that can be found in nearly every city.

Spanish food can be described as quite light with a lot of vegetables and a huge variety of meat and fish. Perhaps owing to the inquisition trying to \\\"find out\\\" lapsed ''conversos'' pork (religiously prohibited in both Judaism and Islam) is easily the most consumed meat and features prominently in many dishes. Spanish cuisine does not use many spices; it relies only on the use of high quality ingredients to give a good taste. As such, you may find Spanish food bland at times but there are usually a variety of restaurants in most cities (Italian, Chinese, American fast food) if you would like to experience a variety of flavors. If you are familiar with Latin American cuisines, keep in mind that many Spanish dishes may have the same name as several Latin American dishes, but actually refer to completely different dishes (e.g. ''tortilla'', ''horchata'' and ''mazap\\u00e1n'' refer to completely different things in Spain and Mexico).\\n\\nLike much of Europe, Spain's top tourism destinations are full of tourist-trap restaurants that serve overpriced and mediocre food. If you want a good and reasonably-priced meal, it's generally best to go to restaurants with a primarily local clientele. However, as it is rare to find English-speaking waiters in such establishments, be prepared to have to speak some Spanish.\\n\\n===Breakfast, lunch and dinner times===\\nSpaniards have a different eating timetable than many people are used to.\\n\\nThe key thing to remember for a traveller is:\\n* breakfast ('''desayuno''') for most Spaniards is light and consists of just coffee and perhaps a ''galleta'' (like a graham cracker) or ''magdalena'' (sweet muffin-like bread).  Later, some will go to a cafe for a pastry midmorning, but not too close to lunchtime.\\n* \\\"el aperitivo\\\" is a light snack eaten around 12:00. However, this could include a couple of glasses of beer and a large filled baguette or a \\\"pincho de tortilla\\\".[[File:TapasenBarcelona.JPG|thumb|\\\"Pinchos\\\" in Barcelona]]\\n* lunch ('''comida''') starts at 13:30-14:30 (though often not until 15:00) and was once typically followed by a short siesta, usually at summer when temperatures can be quite hot in the afternoon.  This is the main meal of the day with two courses ('''el primer plato''' and '''el segundo plato''' followed by dessert.  ''La comida'' and siesta are usually over by 16:00 at the latest. However, since life has become busier, there is no opportunity for a siesta.\\n* dinner ('''cena''') starts at 20:30 or 21:00, with most client\\u00e8le coming after 21:00. It is a lighter meal than lunch. In Madrid restaurants rarely open before 21:00 and most customers do not appear before 23:00.\\n* there is also an afternoon snack that some take between ''la comida'' and ''la cena'' called '''merienda'''.  It is similar to a tea time in England and is taken around 18:00 or so.\\n* between the lunch and dinner times, most restaurants and cafes are closed, and it takes extra effort to find a place to eat if you missed lunch time. Despite this, you can always look for a ''bar'' and ask for a ''bocadillo'', a baguette sandwich. There are ''bocadillos fr\\u00edos'', cold sandwiches, which can be filled with ham, [[cheese]] or any kind of ''embutido'', and ''bocadillos calientes'', hot sandwiches, filled with pork loin, ''tortilla'', bacon, sausage and similar options with cheese. This can be a really cheap and tasty option if you find a good place.\\n\\nNormally, restaurants in big cities don't close until midnight during the week and 02:00-03:00 during the weekend.\\n\\n===Breakfast===\\n[[File:Chocolate with churros.jpg|thumb|right|230px|\\\"''Chocolate con churros''\\\"]]\\nBreakfast is eaten by most Spaniards. Traditional Spanish breakfast includes coffee or orange juice, and pastries or a small sandwich. In Madrid, it is also common to have hot chocolate with \\\"churros\\\" or \\\"porras\\\". In cafes, you can expect varieties of ''tortilla de patatas'' (see the [[#Spanish dishes|''Spanish dishes'' section]]), sometimes tapas (either breakfast variety or same kind as served in the evenings with alcohol).\\n\\n===Tapas===\\n[[File:Tapas marte\\u00f1as.jpg|thumb|Spanish Tapas]]\\nThe entry level to Spanish food is found in bars as '''tapas''', which are a bit like \\\"starters\\\" or \\\"appetisers\\\", but are instead considered side orders to accompany your drink; in some parts of Spain, a drink is still accompanied automatically by a free tapa, but in places where it's not, ask for ''tapa y ca\\u00f1a'' to order a beer and a tapa. Some bars will offer a wide variety of different tapas; others specialise on a specific kind (like seafood-based). A Spanish custom is to have one tapa and one small drink at a bar, then go to the next bar and do the same.  A group of two or more individuals may order two or more '''tapas''' or order '''raciones''' instead, which are a bit larger in order to share.\\n\\n===Types of dishes===\\n\\n'''Seafood''' (''mariscos''): on the coast, fresh seafood is widely available and quite affordable. In the inner regions, frozen (and poor quality) seafood can be frequently encountered outside few highly reputed (and expensive) restaurants. In coastal areas seafood deserves some attention, especially on the north Atlantic coast.\\n\\nQuality seafood in Spain comes from Spain's northwestern region of Galicia. So restaurants with the words ''Gallego'' (Galician) will generally specialise in seafood. If you are feeling adventurous,  you might want to try the Galician regional specialty ''Pulpo a la Gallega'', which is boiled octopus served with paprika, rock salt and olive oil. Another adventurous option is ''Sepia'' which is cuttlefish, a relative of squid, or the various forms of ''Calamares'' (squid) that you can find in most seafood restaurants. If that isn't your style you can always order ''Gambas Ajillo'' (garlic shrimp), ''Pescado Frito'' (fried fish), ''Bu\\u00f1uelos de Bacalao'' (breaded and deep fried cod) or the ever-present ''Paella'' dishes.\\n\\n'''Meat products''' are usually of very good quality, because Spain has maintained quite a high percentage of free range animals.\\n\\nOrdering beef steaks is highly recommended, since most come from free range cows from the mountains.\\n\\nPork cuts which are also highly coveted are those known as ''presa ib\\u00e9rica'' and ''secreto ib\\u00e9rico'', an absolute must if found in the menu of any restaurant.\\n\\n'''Soups''': the choice of soups beyond gazpacho is very limited in Spanish restaurants.\\n\\n===Restaurants===\\n'''Water''' (''agua'') is frequently served without a specific request, and is normally charged for, unless it's included in your ''menu del dia''. If you would like free tap water instead of bottled water, ask for ''agua del grifo''. However, not all restaurants will offer this and you may be forced to order bottled water.\\n\\n'''Appetisers''' such as bread (''pan''), cheese (''queso''), and other items may be brought to your table even if you didn't order them. You may still be charged for them. If you do not want these appetisers, politely inform the waiter that you do not want them.\\n\\n'''World-famous restaurants''': There are several restaurants in Spain which are destinations in themselves, becoming a sole reason to travel to a specific city. One of them is ''El Celler de Can Roca'' in [[Girona]].\\n\\n==== Fast food====\\nFast food has not yet established a strong grip on the Spaniards and you will find McDonalds and Burger King only in bigger towns in the usual places. That said, Madrid and other large Spanish cities are often the first place for North American chains to dip their toe into the European market and you'll find Taco Bell, TGI Friday's or Five Guys there but not or only rarely in central European cities. The menu can be a surprise since it has been customised to appeal to the locals and beer, salads, yogurt (primarily Danone), and wine are prominent. Pizza is increasingly popular and you will find some outlets in bigger towns but it can be their own homegrown franchises, such as TelePizza. In spite of beer and wine on the menu, fast food is often seen as \\\"kiddie food.\\\" American franchises generally charge higher prices than in the United States, and fast food is not necessarily the cheapest alternative for eating out.\\n\\n====Service charges and VAT====\\n\\nNo '''service charges''' are included in the bill. A little extra tip is common and you are free to increase that if you are very pleased. Obviously you don't have to tip a lousy waiter. You would typically leave the small change after paying with a note.\\n\\n====Men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda====\\n\\nMany restaurants offer a complete lunch meal for a fixed price &ndash; ''men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' &ndash; and this often works out as a bargain. Water or wine (''vino'') is commonly included in the price.\\n\\n====Non-Spanish cuisine====\\n\\nThings like schnitzel, full English breakfast, pizza, d\\u00f6ner, and frozen fish are largely available in tourist destinations. In most cities you can also find international cuisine such as Italian, Chinese, French, Thai,  Japanese, Middle Eastern, Vietnamese, and Argentinian. The bigger the city, the more variety you can find.\\n\\nUnlike some northern European countries, Spain received very little immigration until after the death of Franco and the 1980s economic boom and as such there may be less variety of immigrant-owned restaurants in small- and medium-sized towns, but this is of course changing with particularly Latin American and Middle Eastern immigration to Spain leaving their mark on the restaurant scene.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n{{see also|Spanish cuisine#Beverages}}\\n=== Tea and coffee ===\\nSpanish people are very passionate about the quality, intensity  and taste of their [[coffee]] (''caf\\u00e9'') and good freshly brewed coffee is available almost everywhere.\\n\\nThe usual choices are '''solo''', the milk-less espresso version; '''cortado''', solo with a dash of milk; '''con leche''', solo with milk added; and '''manchado''', coffee with lots of milk (sort of like the French ''cafe au lait''). Asking for ''caffee latte'' will likely result in less milk than you are used to\\u2014it's always OK to ask for extra milk.\\n\\nRegional variants can be found, such as '''bomb\\u00f3n''' in Eastern Spain, solo with condensed milk.\\n\\n'''[http://www.starbucks.es Starbucks]''' is the only national chain operating in Spain. Locals argue that it cannot compete with small local cafes in quality of coffee and visited only by tourists. It is not present in smaller cities.\\n\\nIf you eat for \\u20ac20 per dinner, you will never be served a good tea; expect Pompadour or Lipton. It takes some effort to find a good tea if you spend most time of the day in touristy places.\\n\\n'''Horchata''' is a milky non-alcoholic drink made of tiger nuts and sugar, and very different from drinks of the same name found in [[Latin America]]. [[Alboraia]], a small town close to [[Valencia]], is regarded as a best place where horchata is produced.\\n\\n===Alcohol===\\nThe drinking age in Spain is 18. People under this age are forbidden to drink and buy alcoholic drinks, although enforcement in tourist and clubbing areas is lax. Drinking in the streets has been banned (although it is still a common practice in most nightlife areas). A \\\"dry law\\\" bans supermarkets from selling alcohol after 22:00.\\n\\nTry an absinthe cocktail (the fabled liquor was never outlawed here, but it is not a popular drink in Spain).\\n\\n===Bars===\\n\\nProbably one of the best places to meet people in Spain is in bars. Everyone visits them and they are always busy and sometimes bursting with people. There is no age restriction imposed to enter these premises, but children and teenagers often will not be served alcoholic drinks.  Age restrictions for the consumption of alcohol are clearly posted at bars but are enforced only intermittently. It is common to see an entire family at a bar.\\n\\nIt's important to know the difference between a pub (which closes at 3-03:30) and a club (which opens until 06:00-08:00 but is usually deserted early in the night).\\n\\nOn weekends, the time to go out for ''copas'' (drinks) usually starts at about 23:00-01:00 which is somewhat later than in North and Central Europe. Before that, people usually do any number of things, have some tapas (''raciones'', ''algo para picar''), eat a \\\"real\\\" dinner in a restaurant, stay at home with family, or go to cultural events. If you want to go dancing, you will find that most of the clubs in Madrid are relatively empty before midnight (some do not even open until 01:00) and most won't get crowded until 03:00. People usually go to pubs, then go to the clubs until 06:00-08:00.\\n\\nFor a true Spanish experience, after a night of dancing and drinking it is common to have a breakfast of ''chocolate con churros'' with your friends before going home. (''CcC'' is a small cup of thick, melted chocolate served with freshly fried sweet fritters used for dipping in the chocolate and should be tried, if only for the great taste.)\\n\\nBars are mainly to have drink and a small ''tapa'' while socialising and decompressing from work or studies. Usually Spaniards can control their alcohol consumption better than their northern European neighbours and drunken people are rarely seen at bars or on the streets.  A drink, if ordered without an accompanying tapa, is often served with a \\\"minor\\\" or inexpensive tapa as a courtesy.\\n\\nSize and price of tapas changes a lot throughout Spain. For instance, it's almost impossible to get free tapas in big cities like Valencia or Barcelona, excluding Madrid where there are several Tapa Bars although some are a bit expensive. You can eat for free (just paying for the drinks), with huge tapas and cheap prices at cities like Granada, Badajoz or Salamanca.\\n\\nThe tapa, and the related pincho, trace their existence in Spain to both acting as a cover (\\\"Tapa\\\") on top of a cup of wine to prevent flies from accessing it, and as a requirement of law when serving wine at an establishment during the Middle Ages.\\n\\n===Alcoholic beverages===\\n[[File:Wine on tap, Spar, Girona.jpg|thumb|Cheap vermouth and red wine at a supermarket in [[Catalonia]]. Bring your own bottle!]]\\nThe Spanish '''[[Beer (beverage)|beer]]''' is well worth a try. Most popular local brands include San Miguel, Cruzcampo, Mahou, \\u00c1mbar, Estrella Galicia, Keller and many others, including local brands at most cities; import beers are also available.\\nSpaniards often add lemon juice (Fanta lim\\u00f3n, or lemon Fanta) to their beer. Particularly on hot summer days people will drink a refreshing \\\"clara\\\" which is a light beer mixed with lemon/lemonade.\\n\\n'''Cava''' is Spanish sparkling wine. The Spanish used to call it ''champan'', but the French argued that champagne can be made only from grapes grown in the [[Champagne|Champagne region]]. Nevertheless, Cava is a very successful sparkling wine, with 99% of the nation's production coming from the area around [[Barcelona]]. '''Cider''' (Sidra) can be found in the [[Galicia]], [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]] and [[Basque Country|Pa\\u00eds Vasco]].\\n\\nSpain is a country with great '''[[wine]]'''-making and drinking traditions: 22% of Europe's wine growing area is in Spain, however the production is about half of what the French produce. For red wine in a bar, ask \\\"un tinto por favor\\\", for white wine \\\"un blanco por favor\\\", for rose: \\\"un rosado por favor\\\". '''Wine bars''' proper are more and more popular. In short, a wine bar is a sophisticated tapas bar where you can order wine by the glass. You will see a blackboard with the wines that are available and the price per glass.\\n\\n'''Sangria''' is drink made of wine and fruits and usually is made from cheaper wines. You will find sangria in areas frequented by tourists. Spanish prepare sangria for fiestas and hot summer, and not every day as seen in tourist regions like [[Mallorca]]. Sangria in restaurants aimed for foreigners are best avoided, but it is a very good drink to try if a Spaniard prepares it for a fiesta!\\n\\nThe pale '''sherry''' wine around Jerez called \\\"fino\\\" is fortified with alcohol to 15 percent. If you would like to have one in a bar you have to order a ''fino''. Manzanilla is bit salty, good as an aperitivo. Amontillado and Oloroso are a different types of sherry where the oxidative aging process has taken the lead.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n{{infobox|What's the difference?|There are three names for hotel-like accommodation in large cities in Spain: ''hotel'', ''hostal'' and ''pension''. It is important not to confuse a hostel with a ''hostal''; a host'''e'''l offers backpacker-type accommodation with shared rooms, whereas a ''host'''a'''l'' is very similar to a guest house and is generally cheaper than a hotel.}}\\n\\nThere are many types of tourist accommodation, ranging from hotels, pensions, rented villas and [[vacation homes]], to camping and even monasteries.\\n\\n\\\"7% VAT is not included\\\" is a common trick for mid-range guesthouses and hotels: always check the small print when you choose your place to stay. VAT is IVA in Spanish.\\n\\n===Small villages===\\nBesides the coasts, Spain is rich in small tourist-friendly ''inland'' villages, like [[Alquezar]]: with narrow medieval streets, charming silence and isolation, still good selection of affordable restaurants and accommodation.\\n\\n===Casa rural, the [[bed and breakfast]] of Spain===\\n\\nFor a more homely sort of accommodation consider the casa rural. A casa rural is the rough equivalent to a bed and breakfast or a g\\u00eete. Not all houses are situated in the countryside, as the name implies. Some are situated in the smaller towns, and they are in virtually every province.\\n\\nCasas rurales vary in quality and price throughout Spain. In some regions, like [[Galicia]], they are strictly controlled and inspected. Other regions are not so thorough in applying their regulations.\\n\\n===Hotels===\\n\\nMany foreign visitors stay in hotels that have been organised by tour operators who offer package holidays to the popular resorts on the costas and islands. However, for the independent traveller, there are hotels all over the country in all categories and to suit every budget. In fact, due to the well developed internal and foreign tourism markets Spain may well be one of the best served European countries in terms of numbers and quality of hotels.\\n\\n===Paradores===\\nA [http://www.parador.es/ ''parador''] is a state-owned hotel in Spain (rating from 3 to 5 stars). This chain of inns was founded in 1928 by the Spanish King Alfonso XIII. The unique aspects of paradores are their location and their history. Found mostly in historical buildings, such as convents, Moorish castles (like [[La Alhambra]]), or haciendas, paradores are the exact opposite of the uncontrolled development found in coastal regions like the [[Costa del Sol]]. Hospitality has been harmoniously integrated with the restoration of castles, palaces and convents, rescuing from ruin and abandonment monuments representative of Spain's historical and cultural heritage.\\n[[File:Parador Santo Estevo, Nogueira de Ramu\\u00edn.jpg|thumb|Parador de Santo Estevo, in the province of Orense (Galicia)]]\\nFor example, the parador in Santiago de Compostela is located next to the cathedral in a former royal hospital built in the year 1499. Rooms are decorated in an old-fashioned way, but nevertheless have modern facilities. Other notable paradores are in [[Arcos de la Frontera]], [[Ronda]], [[Santillana del Mar]] (Altamira cave) as well as more than one hundred other destination all over Spain.\\n\\nParadores serve breakfast (about \\u20ac10) and often have very good local cuisine typical of their region (about \\u20ac25).\\n\\nAccommodation prices are good value, when you consider that the hotels are often found in the heart of scenic areas, varying from \\u20ac85 for a double room to \\u20ac245 for a twin room (like in [[Granada (Spain)|Granada]]). Two of the most beautiful paradors are in [[Leon (Spain)|L\\u00e9on]] and [[Santiago de Compostela]].\\n\\nThere are some promotions available:\\n* Over 60 year-olds can enjoy a discount.\\n* Youngsters under 30 can visit the paradors at a fixed rate of \\u20ac35 per person.\\n* Two nights half board have a discount of 20%.\\n* A dreamweek of 6 nights is cheaper.\\n* 5 nights at \\u20ac42 per person.\\n\\nThe promotions do not always apply, especially in August they are not valid, and may require advance bookings.\\n\\n===Hostels===\\nThere are plenty of [[hostels]]. Prices vary from \\u20ac15 to \\u20ac25 per night. Spanish \\\"hostales\\\" are not really hostels, but more like unclassified small hotels (with generally no more than a dozen rooms). They can vary in quality from very rudimentary to reasonably smart.\\n* {{sleep\\n| name=Independent-hotels.info Spain | alt= | url=http://independent-hotels.info/spain/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| price= | checkin= | checkout=\\n| content= includes a fair number of good value independent hostales among the hotel listings.\\n}}\\n* {{sleep\\n| name=Xanascat | alt= | url=http://www.xanascat.cat | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| price= | checkin= | checkout=\\n| content=The Regional Network of Youth Hostels of Catalonia if you are visiting Barcelona, Girona, Taragona or other locations in the region.\\n}}\\n\\n===Apartment rental===\\nShort-term, self-catering apartment rental is an option for travellers who want to stay in one place for a week or more. Accommodations range from small apartments to villas.\\n\\nThe number of holiday rentals available depends on the area of Spain you are planning to visit. Although they are common in coastal areas, big capitals and other popular tourist cities, if you plan to visit small inland towns, you will find casas rurales more easily.\\n\\n===Camping===\\nCamping is the least expensive lodging option.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nAs per rest of the [[European Union#Stay safe|European Union]], all emergencies can be reported to the toll-free number '''112'''.\\n\\n===Police===\\n[[File:2019 09 19 Cotxe de la Policia nacional aparcat sobre pas de vianants i carril bici 01.jpg|thumb|Police car of the National Police]]\\n[[File:La Palma - El Paso - Calle Paso de Abajo 04 ies.jpg|thumb|Police car of the Guardia Civil]]\\nThere are four kinds of police in Spain:\\n\\n* ''Polic\\u00eda Municipal'' or ''Local'' (municipal/local police), In [[Barcelona]]: Guardia Urbana. Uniforms change from town to town, but they usually wear black or blue clothes with pale blue shirt and a blue cap (or white helmet) with a checkered white-and-blue strip. Local police keeps order and rules the traffic inside cities, and they can help in case you are lost and need some directions. Although you can't directly report [[crime]]s to them, they will escort you to the local ''Policia Nacional'' headquarters if required, and they will escort the suspects to be arrested also, if needed.\\n* ''Polic\\u00eda Nacional'' (National Police) wear dark blue clothes and blue cap (sometimes replaced by a baseball-like cap), unlike Polic\\u00eda Municipal, they do not have a checkered flag around their cap/helmet. Inside cities, all offenses/crimes should be reported to them, although the other police forces would help anyone who needs to report an offense.\\n* ''Guardia Civil'' (Civil Guard) keeps the order outside cities, in the country, and regulates traffic in the roads between cities. You would probably see them guarding official buildings, or patrolling the roads. They wear plain green military-like uniform; for ceremonial duties, officers wear a black hat (''tricornio'') resembling a toreador cap, a tradition dated back to the 19th century, but most of them use green caps or white motorcycle helmets. The Guardia Civil likes to project a \\\"tough guy\\\" image and they are sometimes accused of excessive use of force.\\n* Given that Spain has a high grade of political autonomy granted to its regional governments, four of them have created regional law forces: the Polic\\u00eda Foral in Navarre, the Ertzaintza in the Basque Country, the Polic\\u00eda Canaria on the Canary Islands or the Mossos d'Esquadra in Catalonia. These forces have the almost the same competences as the Polic\\u00eda Nacional in their respective territories. Additionally there is BESCAM (Brigadas Especiales de Seguridad de la Comunidad Aut\\u00f3noma de Madrid) in the Madrid region which sit somewhere between local police and a fully autonomous police of an autonomous region but carry their own uniforms and livery on vehicles.\\n\\nAll kinds of police also wear high-visibility clothing (\\\"reflective\\\" jackets) while directing traffic, or in the road.\\n\\nSome thieves have been known to pose as police officers, asking to see wallets for identification purposes. If approached by someone claiming to be a police officer only show only your ID after the person has presented theirs; do not show your wallet or other valuables.\\n\\nIf you are a victim of crime call 112. You can ask for a copy of the \\u201cdenuncia\\u201d (police report) if you need it for insurance purposes, or to apply for replacement documents.  Make sure that it is a \\u201cuna denuncia\\u201d not a sworn declaration (una declaraci\\u00f3n judicial), as the latter may not be accepted as evidence of the crime for insurance purposes, or when applying for your new passport.\\n\\n====Making a police report====\\n\\nYou can make a police report in three different ways:\\n\\n1. In person.  A list of police stations in the different regions of Spain is available here. English language interpreters are not always available at short notice: it may be advisable to bring a Spanish-speaking person with you.\\n\\n2. By telephone: You can make a police report by phone in English {{phone|+34 901 102 112}}. The English language service is available 09:00-21:00, seven days a week. Once you have made your report, you will be instructed to pick up a signed copy of the report at your nearest police station. However, some crimes, particularly more serious crimes or those involving violence, can only be reported in person.\\n\\n3. Online: You can also make a police report online, but in Spanish only. Some crimes, especially more serious crimes involving physical violence, must be reported in person.\\n\\n=== Permissions and documentation ===\\n\\n[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-3442 Spanish law] strictly requires foreigners who are in Spanish territory to have documentation proving their identity and the fact of being legally in Spain. You must have that with you all the time because you may be asked by the Police to show those at any moment. If you don't carry it with you, you may be escorted to the nearest police station for identification.\\n\\n===Safety===\\n\\nSpain is a safe country, but there are certain security risks specific to Spain.\\n\\n* Large cities like Alicante, Barcelona, Madrid, and Sevilla, in particular, report many incidents of pick-pocketing, mugging, and violent attacks, some of which require the victim to seek medical attention. Although crimes occur at all times of day and night and to people of all ages, older and Asian tourists seem to be particularly at risk.\\n* In Madrid and also in Barcelona, criminals often target people from East Asia (especially China, S. Korea, Japan, and Taiwan), thinking they carry money and are easy prey.\\n\\n[[File:Barcelona (4624904973).jpg|thumb|View of Barcelona]]\\n\\n* Beware of [[pickpockets]] and thieves, especially in Madrid and Barcelona.\\n* Theft from rental vehicles is high. Be vigilant in service areas on the highways along the coast. Avoid leaving any luggage or valuables in the vehicle and use secure parking facilities.\\n* Avoid women offering rosemary, refuse it always; they will read your future, ask for some money, and your pocket will probably be picked. Some women will also approach you on the street repeating \\\"Buena suerte\\\" (\\\"good luck\\\") as a distraction for another woman to try to pickpocket you.\\n* More foreign passports are stolen each year in Spain than anywhere else in the world, especially in Barcelona. Ensure that your passport is protected at all times.\\n* In the event of a road-related incident, exercise extreme caution and do not accept help from anyone other than a uniformed Spanish police officer or Civil Guard in a marked vehicle. Thieves in Spain have been known to fake or provoke a flat tire on their own vehicles, and when a motorist stops to help them, the thieves steal the motorist's car or belongings. The reverse scenario has also occurred, whereby a fake Good Samaritan stops to help a motorist in distress, only to steal the motorist's car or belongings. There have been reports of thieves damaging rental cars departing major cities (especially Barcelona) in order to induce flat tires in rural areas where tourists can be more easily attacked.\\n\\n===Scams===\\n{{See also|Common scams}}\\nSome people could try to take advantage of your ignorance of local customs.\\n\\n* In Spanish cities, all taxis should have a visible fare table. Do not agree a fixed price to go from an airport to a city: in most cases, the taxi driver will be earning more money than without a preagreed tariff. Many taxi drivers will also demand a tip from foreign customers or even from national ones on the way to and from the airport. You might round up to the nearest euro when paying though.\\n* In many places of Madrid, especially near Atocha station, and also in the Ramblas of [[Barcelona]], there are people ('trileros') who play the \\\"shell game\\\". They will \\\"fish\\\" you if you play, and they will most likely pick your pocket if you stop to see other people play.\\n* Before paying the bill in bars and restaurants, always check the bill and carefully scrutinise it. Some staff will often attempt to squeeze a few extra euros out of unsuspecting tourists by charging for things they did not eat or drink, or simply overcharging. This is true in both touristy and non-touristy areas. If you feel overcharged, bring it to their attention and/or ask to see a menu. It is also sometimes written (in English only) at the bottom of a bill that a tip is not included: remember that tipping is optional in Spain and Spanish people commonly leave loose change only and no more than a 5%\\u20138% of the price of what they have consumed (not an American-style 15\\u201320%), so avoid being fooled into leaving more.\\n* Many tourists have reported lottery scams whereby they are contacted via the Internet or fax and informed that they have won a substantial prize in the Spanish lottery (El Gordo), when in fact they have never participated in the lottery. They are asked to deposit an amount of money in a bank account to pay taxes and other fees before collecting the prize or coming to Spain to close the transaction.\\n* There have also been reports of a scam whereby a person is informed that he or she is the recipient of a large inheritance, and that funds must be deposited into a Spanish bank account so the inheritance can be processed.\\n* In another common scam, some tourists have received a bogus email purportedly sent from an individual well known to them and claiming that he or she is in trouble and needs funds.\\n\\n===Other things you should know===\\n\\n* Spanish cities can be '''loud at night''', especially on weekends, but the streets are generally safe even for women.\\n* All businesses should have an official '''complaint form''', in case you need it. It is '''illegal''' for a business to deny you this form.\\n* In some cases, police in Spain may target people belonging to ethnic minorities for '''identity checks'''. People who are not \\\"European-looking\\\" can be stopped several times a day to have their papers checked on the pretext of \\\"migration control\\\".\\n* There has been an increase in political action and '''public demonstrations''' on a rolling basis throughout Spain. Demonstrations occur and have sometimes turned violent, mostly to police officers. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media. Strikes may occasionally lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. When a demonstration is planned or in progress you should seek advice on and avoid the routes marchers plan to take. You should also ensure to check for travel updates or transport delays before and during your trip to Spain.<!--\\n-->[[File:The evening rush.jpg|thumb|Evening rush in Madrid]]\\n* '''Driving''' in Spain can be dangerous due to traffic congestion in urban areas, although driving is not particularly aggressive with the exception of common speeding. Be cautious when driving in Spain. Night driving can be particularly dangerous. The use of a mobile phone without a hands-free device can result in a fine and you being banned from driving in Spain. All drivers are required to carry, in the vehicle, a reflective vest and to use a reflective triangle warning sign if they need to stop at the roadside.\\n* Be cautious when approached by someone who '''claims to be a police''' officer. On the road, you will always be stopped by an officer in a uniform. Unmarked vehicles will have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window which reads ''Polic\\u00eda'' or ''Guardia Civil'', and either ''Ertzaintza'' if in the Basque Country, or ''Mossos d'Esquadra'' if in Catalonia, or ''Foruzaingoa/Polic\\u00eda Foral'' in Navarre. Most times they will have blue flashing lights incorporated into the headlights. In non-traffic-related matters police officers may be in casual clothes. Police officers do not have to directly identify themselves unless you ask them to. Should they request identification, they should be shown photographic ID. Your passport or your driver's licence will do, or your national ID card if you are from the European Union, though a passport is always preferred. You can get in trouble or be fined for not having any identification on you. If in any doubt, drivers should converse through the car window and contact the Guardia Civil on 062 or the Spanish National Police on 112 and ask them to confirm that the registration number of the vehicle corresponds to an official police vehicle.\\n\\n=== Drugs ===\\nYou can smell marijuana smoke at many street corners in major cities with police apparently unperturbed by it. Still, if you don't know local customs, it is quite possible that the police make a show of enforcing the law on you.\\n\\nThe consumption of alcoholic beverages in the street, or when it seriously disrupts public tranquillity is fined up to \\u20ac600.\\n\\nThese rules are actively enforced.\\n\\n==Stay healthy==\\n\\n===Healthcare===\\n* Pharmaceuticals are not sold at supermarkets, only at ''farmacias'' (pharmacies/chemists), identified with a green cross or a Hygeia's cup. Nearly every city and town has at least one 24-hour pharmacy; for those that close at  night, the law requires  a poster with the address of the nearest pharmacy, possibly in one of the nearby streets or towns.\\n* People from the European Union and a few more European countries can freely use the public health system, if they have the appropriate European Health Insurance Card. The card does not cover treatment in private hospitals. Agreements are established to treat people from a few American countries.\\n* Do not hesitate to '''go to any healthcare facility''' should you be injured or seriously ill, as it would be illegal for them not to treat you, even if you are uninsured. You (or your country if Spain has a treaty on the matter) will pay for the service later.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n* Although many visitors travel to Spain for the warm climate, it can be cold in winter, especially in the Central Region and in the North, and in some places it is also rainy in summer. Remember to travel with adequate clothes.\\n* In summer, avoid direct exposure to sunlight for long periods of time to prevent [[Sunburn and sun protection|sunburn and heatstroke]]. Drink water, walk on the shady side of street and keep a container of sun cream (suntan lotion) handy.\\n\\n===Water===\\nThe '''[[tap water]]''' in Spain is safe and of a drinkable quality. The water in some southern regions of the country, however, is sometimes sourced from salt water which can have a high mineral content. This can cause upset stomachs in those not used to this. While high mineral content water is safe to drink regardless, locals in these areas will often drink bottled water instead as it tastes better. Bottled water is readily available to buy in most areas and in a variety of brands.\\n\\n===Smoking===\\nSmoking is banned in all enclosed public spaces and places of work, in public transportation, and in outdoor public places near hospitals and in playgrounds. Smoking is also banned in outdoor sections of bars and restaurants. Smoking is banned in television broadcasts as well.\\n\\n==Respect==\\nGenerally speaking, Spaniards are widely regarded as welcoming and friendly.\\n\\n====Culture and identity====\\n\\nSpaniards are generally '''neutral communicators'''. They're comfortable with expressing their opinions and emotions on something, and they expect the same from you. While this may give you the impression that Spanish people are confident and sociable, you should make every effort to be tactful with your words as they are sensitive to being beckoned directly.\\n\\nIn conversational settings, it is common for people to interrupt or talk over one another. Shouting to make oneself heard is common, as is the use of swear words. You may also find that it is common for people to give you advice on all kinds of things. For instance, you can expect people to tell you what to see and where to go. At first, this may come across as annoying, but the information that Spaniards provide is meant to help you in a good way, not lay traps for you.\\n\\nFamily values are important to many Spaniards. Passing unwarranted comments and/or criticisms about someone's family members is considered rude.\\n\\nSpaniards, especially the young, generally feel a linguistic and cultural connection to Latin America. However, most will be quick to point out that Spain is a European nation, not a Latin American one and that all Spanish-speaking countries are different and have particularities of their own.\\n\\nSpaniards are not as religious as the media sometimes presents them, and modern Spanish society is for the most part rather secular, but they are and always were a mostly Catholic country (73% officially, although only 10% admit practising and only 20% admit being believers); respect this and avoid making any comments that could offend. In particular, religious festivals, Holy Week (Easter), and Christmas are very important to Spaniards. Tolerance of all religions should be observed, especially in large urban areas like Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville or Malaga (where people and temples of all beliefs can be found) or different regions in southern Spain, which may have a sizable Muslim population (which accounts for almost 4% of the country's population).\\n\\n[[File:Ayuntamiento de Madrid - Rainbow flag - 170627 204010.jpg|thumb|The rainbow flag on Madrid's city hall]]\\nDespite being a Catholic majority country, '''homosexuality''' is quite tolerated in Spain and public display of same-sex affection would not likely stir hostility. A 2013 Pew survey of various countries in the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East found that Spain had the highest percentage of people who believed homosexuality should be accepted by society, at 88%. Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2005 and the government provides legal benefits to same-sex couples. However, this does not always necessarily mean that all Spaniards are friendly to gays; while homophobic aggressions are rare, they still happen. Cities are more tolerant of homosexuality than rural areas, Madrid, Catalonia and the Basque Country are much more tolerant but overall Spain is gay-friendly. As in any other place, elderly people do usually have far more conservative points of view. The Madrid pride parade is one of the largest in the world. Overall, Spain is one of the safest countries for LGBT tourists.\\n\\nAvoid talking about the former colonial past and especially about the \\\"Black Legend.\\\" Regardless of what you may have heard Spain had several ministers and military leaders of mixed race serving in the military during the colonial era and even a Prime Minister born in the Philippines (Marcelo Azcarraga Palmero). Many Spaniards take pride in their history and former imperial glories. People from Spain's former colonies (Latin America, Equatorial Guinea, the Philippines, Western Sahara and Northern Morocco) make up a majority of foreign immigrants in Spain (58%) along with the Chinese, Africans and Eastern Europeans. Equally, Spain is one of the main investors and economic and humanitarian aid donors to Latin America and Africa.\\n\\n'''Bullfighting''' (Spanish: ''Tauromaquia'') is seen by many Spaniards as a cultural heritage icon, but the disaffection with bullfighting is increasing in all big cities and obviously among animal activist groups within the country. Many urban Spaniards would consider bullfighting a show aimed at foreign tourists and elderly people from the countryside, and some young Spaniards will feel offended if their country is associated with it. To illustrate how divided the country is, many Spaniards point to the royal family: former king Juan Carlos and his daughter are avid fans, while his wife and son King Felipe VI do not care for the sport. Bullfights and related events, such as the annual San Fermin Pamplona bull-runs, make up a multi-million euro industry and draw many tourists, both foreign and Spanish. In addition, bullfighting has been banned in the northeastern region of Catalonia as well as in several towns and counties all over the country.\\n\\nTake care when mentioning the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 to 1975 as well as the Civil War of 1936\\u20131939. This was a painful past as Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist, executing many Spaniards who violated the anti-democratic laws of the regime. It was also a notable period of economic growth in the final years of Franco's regime, and some older Spaniards may have supportive views of him. The Republican flag (red, yellow, purple, either with or without a coat of arms) can be seen hanging from balconies and bought at some souvenir shops. However, it is not an uncontroversial symbol and associated with leftism, often showing up at leftist demonstrations. No symbols from the Franco era are officially forbidden, but using or displaying them is associated with far right extremists.\\n\\nThe possibilities of '''[[Catalonia|Catalan]]''' independence, '''[[Basque Country|Basque]]''' independence, and '''[[Galicia]]n''' independence are extremely sensitive issues among many in Spain. You should avoid discussing them where possible. If anything surrounding these subjects is brought up by someone, it's best to stay neutral.\\n\\nVirtually everyone in Spain, regardless of region, is able to speak '''Castilian Spanish''', albeit not always as a mother tongue. In Catalonia, some Catalans prefer to not speak Spanish at all, and will reply to Spanish-speaking interlocutors in Catalan; this is usually a political statement, rather than a lack of Castilian language ability. Foreigners are given a bit more leeway, but there are still some Catalans who'd rather have a conversation in English than Spanish if those are the only options for communication. While many Spaniards from Castilla consider Catalan to be a dialect of Spanish, Catalans consider it to be a separate language in its own right.\\n\\nThe political status of Gibraltar is a particularly sensitive issue. Most Spaniards consider Gibraltar to be Spanish sovereign territory that is illegally occupied by Britain. Most Gibraltarians on the other hand are both proud Brits and proud Europeans - a situation made infinitely more awkward by Brexit which passed against near unanimous Gibraltarian opposition.\\n\\nAvoid discussing the Spanish monarchy. Many are generally opposed to the Spanish royal family, although there are some who are staunchly monarchist. Due to the Bourbon dynasty's identification with centralism, supporters of Catalan and Basque independence often don't have a good word to say about them.\\n\\n====Socialising====\\n\\nIt is customary to kiss friends, family, and acquaintances on both cheeks upon seeing each other and saying goodbye. Male-to-male kisses of this sort are limited to family members or to very close friends; otherwise a firm handshake is expected instead (as is the same in France or Italy).\\n\\nSpaniards are keen to maintain physical contact while talking, such as putting a hand on your shoulder, patting your back, etc. These should be taken as signs of friendship done among relatives, close friends and colleagues.\\n\\nSpaniards will probably feel comfortable around you more quickly than other Europeans and you may even be receive an offensive comment or even an insult (''cabr\\u00f3n'') for a greeting shortly after meeting someone in an informal environment, especially if it is a young person or a male. You should not feel offended by this, as it is interpreted as proof that you have such a close relationship that you can mess with each other without repercussions.\\n\\nYou should reply with a similar comment (never anything serious or something that will genuinely hurt the person) or just greet them. Do not go around insulting people, though, as you will also find people who do not like it. It is recommended that you never do this first as a foreigner and just wait until you get it. Generally, your instinct will be able to distinguish between a joke and a genuine aggression.\\n\\nWhen in a car, the elderly and pregnant always ride in the passenger's seat, unless they request not to.\\n\\nSpaniards are not as punctual as Northern Europeans, but generally you are expected to arrive no more than ten minutes late, and being punctual will always be received positively. It is especially important to be punctual the first time you meet with someone. As a rule of thumb, you should expect people to be more punctual as you go north and less punctual as you go south.\\n\\nIf you are staying at a Spaniard's home, bring shoes to wear inside such as slippers. Walking around barefoot in the house is viewed as unsanitary. Walking in socks may be acceptable in a close friend's house, but you should always ask first.\\n\\nIt is acceptable for women to '''sunbathe topless''' in beaches, but full nudity is only practised in \\\"clothing-optional\\\" or nudist beaches.\\n\\n====Eating and drinking====\\n\\nDuring lunch or dinner, Spaniards do not begin eating until everyone is seated and ready to eat. Likewise, they do not leave the table until everyone is finished eating. Table manners are otherwise standard and informal, although this also depends on the place you are eating. When the bill comes, it is common to pay equally, regardless of the amount or price each has consumed (''pagar a escote'').\\n\\nWhen Spaniards receive a gift or are offered a drink or a meal, they usually refuse for a while, so as not to seem greedy. This sometimes sparks arguments among especially reluctant people, but it is seen as polite. Remember to offer more than once (on the third try, it must be fairly clear if they will accept it or not). On the other hand, if you are interested in the offer, politely smile and decline it, saying that you don't want to be a nuisance, etc., but relent and accept when they insist.\\n\\nSpaniards rarely drink or eat in the street. Bars will rarely offer the option of food to take away but \\\"tapas\\\" are easily available. Taking leftovers home from a restaurant is uncommon but has somewhat less of a stigma than it used to. One asks for \\\"un taper\\\" (derived from \\\"Tupperware\\\") or \\\"una caja.\\\" Older Spaniards are still likely to frown on this. Appearing drunk in public is generally frowned upon.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\nOne odd legacy of the Franco era is that Spain has been on Central European Time since 1940, even though much of the country sits directly south of the United Kingdom and Ireland. This explains why among Spaniards, lunch time is usually between 13:00 and 14:30 (it could be as late as 15:15) while dinner time is between 20:30 and 21:30. At special celebrations, dinner can be as late as 22:00. Lunch is considered the biggest and most important meal of the day.\\n\\nIf you see a restaurant serving breakfast at 7:00, lunch at 12:00 and dinner at 18:00, it may be a tourist trap targeting British and American tourists. The same can be said for restaurants serving paella for dinner, since the dish is traditionally served for lunch.\\n\\nAlmost all small businesses close between 14:30 and 17:00, so plan your shopping and sight-seeing accordingly. Shopping malls and supermarkets, however, are usually open from 09:30 to 21:00 or 22:00, and in the larger cities several shops are open 24 hours daily, usually owned by Chinese immigrants.\\n\\nSpanish cities can be noisy in some areas; you might want to check before booking a room.\\n\\n==Connect==\\n=== Wi-Fi ===\\n\\nWi-Fi points in bars and cafeterias are available to customers, and most hotels offer Wi-Fi connections (at least in common areas) for their guests.\\n\\nBe conscious of security when using a laptop, tablet or phone in an outdoor location.\\n\\n=== Phone numbers ===\\nSince 1998, the area code prefix is included in Spanish telephone numbers, so {{nowrap|9xx xxx xxx}} can be called as {{nowrap|+34 9xx xxx xxx}}. Numbers without an area code can be called similarly, with the domestic number just prefixed with +34. The prefix for international calls from Spain changed to 00 (with mobile phones, just use \\\"+\\\"). Some premium rate and freephone numbers are unreachable from abroad.\\n\\nThe dispute on Gibraltar numbers ended in 2007; now Gibraltar can be reached with the prefix +350 like from everywhere else.\\n\\nThe prefixes 80x and 90x, where x\\u22600, are for possibly expensive (premium rate) numbers. The prefix 807 is for professional services (such as legal or medical advice) paid on the phone bill. The prefixes 901 and 902 are used by many large businesses, but they are often expensive, especially 902, as they aren't covered by the flat rates most operators apply. They are blocked by some operators. 800 and 900 are prefixes for freephone numbers. 90x and 80x can not be reached from outside Spain.\\n\\n=== Mobile phones and SIM cards ===\\nCheap mobile phones (less than \\u20ac50) with some pre-paid minutes are sold at  any phone operator's shop and can be purchased without many formalities (ID is usually required). Topping-up is then done by buying scratch cards from the small stores \\\"Frutos Secos,\\\" supermarkets, vending points (often found in tobacco shops) or kiosks \\u2013 recharging using the Web or an ATM does not work with foreign credit cards.\\n\\n{{EU roaming}}\\n\\nFor supported unlocked phones, a [[Mobile phones#Local SIM cards|local SIM]] or an [[Mobile phones#eSIM|eSIM]] is another alternative.\\n\\nThe three mobile phone networks in Spain are [http://www.vodafone.es/autonomos/es Vodafone], [https://www.movistar.es Movistar],  [https://www.orange.es Orange], and Yoigo.\\n\\n=== Discount calling ===\\n\\n\\\"Locutorios\\\" (call shops) are widely spread in bigger cities and touristy locations. In Madrid or Toledo it's very easy to find one. Making calls from \\\"Locutorios\\\" tend to be much cheaper, especially international calls (usually made through VoIP). They are usually a good pick for calling home.  Prepaid calling cards for cheap international calls are widely available in newsagents or grocery stores around the city. Ask for a \\\"tarjeta telefonica\\\".\\n\\n{{geo|40.4|-3|zoom=6}}\\n{{isPartOf|Iberia}}\\n{{related|Cycling_in_Spain}}\\n{{usablecountry}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Dona_i_Ocell_fragment.jpg|caption=Dona i Ocell sculpture|unesco=yes|origin=0.15,0|unesco_cc=yes}}\\n{{printDistricts}}\\n\\nBarcelona is [[Spain]]'s second largest city, with a population of nearly two million people, and the capital of [[Catalonia]]. A major port on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain, Barcelona has a wide variety of attractions that bring in tourists from around the globe. The many faces of Barcelona include the medieval Old Town, and the unique street grid resulting from 19th-century urban planning. The city has long sandy beaches and green parks on the hills, pretty much side-by-side. It is also famous for a number of prominent buildings, of which the most-known are by the architect Antoni Gaud\\u00ed, including his ''Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia'', which became Barcelona's symbol to many.\\n\\nFounded more than 2,000 years ago as the [[Roman empire|ancient Roman]] town ''Barcino'', Barcelona is as historic as it is modern, with a constant flow of projects changing the face of the city and long-standing penchant for design and innovation. Thanks to the wealth of attractions, a very well-developed accommodation base, a lively nightlife and a robust transportation system, Barcelona has become one of Europe's, and pretty much the world's, most popular tourist destinations.\\n\\n==Districts==\\n\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500|show=mask,go}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q941385|fill=#bdbd7b|title=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q64124|fill=#8888dc|title=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q852697|fill=#75bb75|title=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q753075|fill=#aa6baa|title=[[Barcelona/Sants-Montju\\u00efc|Sants-Montju\\u00efc]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q250935|fill=#67b7b7|title=[[Barcelona/Sant Mart\\u00ed|Sant Mart\\u00ed]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q959944, Q1765582, Q1771488, Q1641049, Q1650230 |fill=#c9815e|title=[[Barcelona/Inland Suburbs|Inland Suburbs]]}} <!-- Les Corts, Sarri\\u00e0-Sant Gervasi, Horta-Guinard\\u00f3, Nou Barris, Sant Andreu -->\\n\\n{{Mapshapes|Q237189|stroke-opacity=0.6}} <!-- metro -->\\n\\n{{Regionlist\\n| region1name=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]\\n| region1color=#bdbd7b\\n| region1description=Barcelona's old town, including the medieval Barri G\\u00f2tic, La Rambla (Les Rambles), Raval, and El Born (also known as La Ribera)\\n\\n| region2name=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]\\n| region2color=#8888dc\\n| region2description=Modernist quarter, central hub of the city, and ''the'' area to go to find Antoni Gaud\\u00ed's work.\\n\\n| region3name=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]\\n| region3color=#75bb75\\n| region3description=Formerly an independent town, it joined the city in the 20th century.

However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\\n\\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to [[Costa Daurada]], north to [[Costa Brava]] or out to sea for the [[Balearic Islands]].\\n\\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low. Given the high humidity, {{convert|19|-|23|\\u00b0C|0}} is considered comfortable weather, which is usually the temperature from May to June, and from late August to October. These are the best times to visit the city.  Anything warmer than this can feel too hot, and the period from November to April is quite chilly and at times gloomy.\\n\\n===With children===\\nToddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain. In any public place, people around you will make every effort possible to make your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them.

Fa\\u00e7ana de la Passi\\u00f3.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia church by Antoni Gaud\\u00ed is perhaps the most known landmark of Barcelona]]\\n\\nBarcelona's official languages are [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] and [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]. About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese. On the other hand, FGC announcements \\u2013 either regular or disruptions \\u2013 will be made only in Catalan, and disruption announcements on RENFE's network will usually be made only in Spanish. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a separate Romance language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.\\n\\nYou might find some locals answer in Catalan after being asked in Spanish, that's not because they are being rude but because they assume you are bilingual. In Catalonia, it's not uncommon to hear people code switching between different languages in the same conversation. In case you can't understand what they are saying, tell them you don't speak Catalan and politely ask them to repeat it in Spanish or English.\\n\\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia is a large scale immigration process from the rest of Spain, which occurred over the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language, and 40% use Catalan. The issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere.\\n\\nIn tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak English. If you are a native English speaker, you will have few problems, as Barcelona hosts many tourists.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\n[[File:Aeropuerto de Barcelona (1322744358).jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona International Airport]]\\nThe main airport is {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona El Prat|wikidata=Q56973}} ({{IATA|BCN}}). Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use the airports of ''[[Girona]]'' ({{IATA|GRO}}), nearly {{km|100}} to the north, or ''[[Reus]]'' ({{IATA|REU}}), around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair started operating at BCN, you should check carefully where your flight goes.

To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for \\u20ac5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs \\u20ac12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport) , tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (\\u20ac7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya on its way to Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya.

Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs \\u20ac13 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac24. The journey takes from 1 hr 30 min to 1 hr 45 min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available [http://www.igualadina.com/pdfs/REUS%20AIRPORT.pdf? online]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}.

Prices start at \\u20ac39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\\n\\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerb\\u00e8re/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\\n\\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7\\u20138 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly \\u20ac30.\\n\\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called ''[http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/larga_distancia/productos/trenhotel.html Trenhotel]'' between Barcelona and Paris.

If you used a multiple journey ticket you won't be charged for a second time when changing lines as long as you are within the stated travel time for a single journey.

It takes little over an hour to walk from Port Vell at the seaside to Park G\\u00fcell at the foothills of the mountain range at the northeastern end of the city, and you can see a range of attractions, including La Rambla and Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia, on your way. There are opportunities all around to sit down and enjoy a drink or a meal everywhere. If you are fit, you can pretty much explore the city by foot alone, unless the heat beats you in the warmer months (and then you can always resort to the air-conditioned metro).\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (\\u20ac3/hour, \\u20ac20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\\n\\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, ''Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes'' is actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\\n\\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\\n* Near ''Moll de Sant Bertran'' (which is south-west from ''Museu Maritim'') - driving at B\\u201310, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\\n* Somewhere near Guell Park.\\n* Near Font M\\u00e0gica, in Pla\\u00e7a Espanya and the Montju\\u00efc hill.\\n\\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.\\n\\n=== By taxi ===\\nAs of January 2019, [[Ride-sharing and carsharing services|ride-sharing services]] such as Uber require at least one hour's notice.

Bon\\u00c0rea, Bonpreu and Condis are the most popular supermarket chains from Catalonia. Mercadona, Consum, and Dia are other popular chains from the rest of Spain. All of them are a cost-effective way to purchase grocery items. There are also organic/specialty supermarkets like Casa Ametller or Veritas which are pricier. Small corner stores are the most visible on city streets, but tend to mark up prices in exchange for convenience.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nAs with all cities which welcome large numbers of tourists, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, but there are plenty of restaurants serving excellent food at very reasonable prices, if you know where to look. The usual rules of thumb apply: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track used by fellow travellers, and seek out caf\\u00e9s and restaurants which the locals frequent. In practice, this usually involves searching out eateries in residential districts away from the main sightseeing attractions. Avoid restaurants with touts outside, and have a basic understanding of the traditional foods served in restaurants, as well as the local drinks. One slightly crafty way of sussing a place's authenticity at a glance is to take note of how they spell a certain word: a menu board advertising ''tap'''a'''s'', written the Spanish/international way, is likely to be somewhere which primarily caters to tourists, whereas somewhere offering ''tap'''e'''s'', using Catalan spelling, is in all probability a venue frequented by locals.\\n\\nSome districts to check out include [[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]], which is a hub of quality, affordable Catalan cooking of both the traditional and more avant-garde varieties, and the [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]], whose chic boulevards have upscale restaurants aplenty worthy of your splurge money. The fishing quarter of Barceloneta (in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]) is an example of a neighbourhood where it pays to be picky: closer to the gentrified seafront, a slew of mojito beach bar-style places serve up expensive tourist tapas; for the real thing, head into the backstreets, where many traditional bars are still tucked away. In all cases, be prepared to \\\"promenade\\\" in search of the most attractive-looking menu; that's what the locals do, after all.\\n\\n{{infobox|Where to eat during siesta|The majority of restaurants and cafes are closed 16:00-20:00 for ''migdiada''. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:\\n* tapas in bars\\n* international chains\\n* food stands in market halls}}\\n\\n'''Set menus (men\\u00fa del migdia / men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda)''' Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a ''men\\u00fa del migdia'' / ''men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' (menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for \\u20ac12 to \\u20ac20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 14:00 to 16:00. The savvy traveller will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve ''platos combinados'', which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.\\n\\n'''Smoking''' is not permitted inside bars and restaurants since 2011, but it's usually allowed in terraces.\\n\\n===Dishes===\\n[[File:Tapas Barcelona.jpg|thumb|250px|A plate of ''tapes'']]\\n\\nYou can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.\\n\\n''See [[Catalonia#Catalan Cuisine|Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article]].''\\n\\nThe selection of '''seafood''' is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).\\n\\nA treat to try that no travel guide mentions is '''waffles''' sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\\n\\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\\n\\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of '''durum''' or '''shawarma''' stands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around \\u20ac5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the '''Asian''' selection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants, while '''Latin American''' offerings, particularly Argentine and [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], are well-represented too.\\n\\n===Food tours===\\n\\nIf you feel lost in the variety of food choices there are \\u2013 Catalan, Basque, Spanish, and beyond \\u2013 it may be helpful to do a food tour to quickly get oriented.

The following areas tend to be restaurant \\\"hubs\\\", with a large variety of restaurants to choose from:\\n* [[Barcelona/Barceloneta|Barceloneta]]: A popular quarter for locals, where you can try fish based dishes, such as ''Paella'' (a name that may hide many different kinds of rice concoctions) or ''Arr\\u00f2s negre'' (''Black Rice''), that takes its colour because it is made using squid ink. Barceloneta is a very good place to eat ''tapas'' as well.\\n* Sant Antoni is the new addition to the culinary scene in Barcelona where old and trendy cuisine mingle.\\n* Eixample Esquerra (between Gran Via and Mallorca)\\n* Barri G\\u00f2tic (especially for tapas)\\n* \\\"El Born\\\" (next to Barri G\\u00f2tic)\\n\\nAround Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya there are dozens of restaurants serving ''tapas''. One should be careful with the tourist traps as the area is highly populated with tourists.\\n\\nFor budget eating you may choose \\\"men\\u00fa del migdia\\\" in small bars on the Avinguda del Parallel for \\u20ac9-11 per person. Be aware that sometimes the menu and the staff are only in Spanish.\\n\\nThe large cafes that line the Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia and the Rambla Catalunya, just north of the Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, offer a variety of acceptable tapas.

Chupitos is Spanish for \\\"shots\\\" and offers hundreds of unique shots including the \\\"Harry Potter\\\" (a shot that sparks as cinnamon is sprinkled over it), and \\\"Monica Lewinsky\\\" (a variety of flaming shots) among others. As much a show as it is a place to get a drink, it's a fun night out.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n[[File:Hotel Vela (8698052023).jpg|thumbnail|right|The sail-shaped hotel W Barcelona is one of the city's newest landmarks]]\\n\\nBarcelona offers a great range of accommodations, from cheap, decent apartments, hostels and guest-houses to five-star hotels. Every district has plentiful offerings, and thanks to the efficient public transportation you can stay comfortably in any of them, depending on your budget and preferences.\\n\\nDuring festivals (see [[#Festivals and events|Festivals and events]] above), especially during [http://www.mobileworldcongress.com Mobile World Congress], which is a major trade show at the Fira, accommodation in Barcelona and especially near the Fira is much more difficult to find and more expensive than usual.\\n\\n* [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella#Sleep|Ciutat Vella]] offers a mix of luxury hotels and cheerful hostels within a dense urban environment.

Wi-Fi is widely available in public places and on transport.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Pickpockets===\\n\\n[[Pickpockets|Pickpocketing]] is the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona. '''Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents''' in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\\n\\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\\n* At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\\n* A milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\\n* East Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \\\"martial arts\\\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\\n* These people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\\n* Male travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\\n* In the '''subway''', a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance ''and'' exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\\n* Under no circumstances should you '''leave your items''' unattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\\n\\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can [https://denuncies.dgp.interior.gencat.cat/denuncies/ file a report online] if you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices.\\n\\n===Scams===\\n{{Seealso|Common scams}}\\n\\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\\n\\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of [[common scams#Overcharging|methods]] are employed, including the [[common scams#No-change_trick|No-change trick]]. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.\\n\\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\\n\\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\\n\\nA version of [[common scams#Three Card Monte|Three Card Monte]] is one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\\n\\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you.\\n\\n===Violent crimes===\\n\\nIn 2019 there was a surge in violent crimes around Barcelona: in just the summer, there were almost as many violent deaths as there were for the whole previous year. While tourists are only occasionally targeted (and almost exclusively simple robberies), this should be not a going concern, many of these deaths are either drug-related or take place during drunken fights, so you are best advised to avoid such situations.\\n\\n===Football===\\nLocal club '''FC Barcelona''' (also known as \\\"Bar\\u00e7a\\\", a term used by locals to refer strictly to the club and not the city) is seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and has a very heated and politically-charged rivalry with Real Madrid, which is seen as a symbol of the Spanish state and ruling establishment, and violent confrontations between the supporters of both clubs have been known to occur. Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\\n\\nFurthermore, the local ''Derbi barcelon\\u00ed'' between FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain. If you hear Bar\\u00e7a and Espanyol fans having an argument, be careful, as things can quickly escalate.\\n\\n===ATMs===\\nBarcelona offers ATMs in many locations. Many provide a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.), and most accept ATM/debit/credit cards of various banks. Choose an ATM in a secure or highly-public space (e.g., in a bank lobby or airport terminal) to avoid machines modified by criminals to skim/video your card data or where you might be robbed after use.  Ensure early in usage that the ATM supports a language you understand. For a full discussion of safe/effective charge/debit/ATM card usage and their cost trade-offs, see also [[Money]]. They will charge you a usage fee on top of anything your bank charges you which should be declared on the screen before you proceed (2,90\\u20ac for a 500\\u20ac withdrawal as of Oct. 2024 across different banks).\\n\\n===Areas of caution===\\n\\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (''cercanias'' in Spanish or ''rodalies'' in Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\\n\\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montju\\u00efc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\\n\\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\\n\\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\\n\\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\\n\\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\\n\\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.\\n\\n===Anti-tourism movement===\\n\\nMany Barcelona residents have the impression that there are too many tourists in Barcelona and that it has increased living costs, as landlords prefer to rent to tourists and not to locals to make more profit. Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024.\\n\\n===Cars===\\n\\nTourist drivers may attract special attention, such as [[common scams#Red light bag snatch|Red light bag snatch]] or [[common scams#Flat tire|Flat tire scams]]\\n\\n===Public transportation===\\n\\nBesides being a particular pickpocket hot spot, there are plenty of fare evaders who will stick to you when crossing a fare barrier. Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean ''carte blanche'' for them. The fare evasion fine is just \\u20ac50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome.\\n\\n===Reporting crimes===\\n\\nIf you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers generally do not speak English, even though the theft report form is in English, Spanish, and Catalan.

See the historical centre, the churches and cathedral, and visit many architectural works of Llu\\u00eds Dom\\u00e8nech i Montaner. Canet is the smallest town in [[Catalonia]] with many historical and modernist buildings. It also has a lot of ''blue flag'' beaches, recognised at the European level for their quality.\\n*[[Col\\u00f2nia G\\u00fcell]] \\u2014 is a tiny settlement famous for its modernist architecture.

See directions to the north airport above.\\n* Montseny - UNESCO Biosphere Reserve {{km|40}} northeast of Barcelona. Go there by car or bus/train\\n* [[Montserrat (Spain)|Montserrat]]  - Visit the monastery nestled high in the mountains to see the Black Madonna or hike to the peak to earn a fantastic view of the surroundings. {{km|50}} from Barcelona.\\n* [[Parc del Garraf]] - Large natural area southwest of Barcelona. Many hikes can be reached by train. Be sure to bring sun protection and plenty of water. (An eleven mile hike, with some decent elevation gain: Take train to Castelldefels station, head up to Castel de Castelldefels, follow trail about 5 miles to La Morella, where you can take in some great views. Trace your steps back half a mile, then continue southwest towards Playa Garraf. Playa Grarraf is right by the Garraf train station, allowing easy access back to Barcelona.)\\n*[[Pyrenees]] - A mountain range around {{km|150}} north from the city.\\n*[https://www.visitsantcugat.cat/en/ Sant Cugat del Valles] - Has one of the most interesting Romanesque cloisters in Catalunya, with many interesting carvings. The town itself is full of expensive vilas.\\n* [[Sitges]] - A traditional beachside destination for the locals. Full of fashion shops open on Sundays. Is a popular gay destination too.\\n* [[Castelldefels]] - Another typical beachside destination for the locals. It is very popular for its wide range of gastronomy.\\n*[[Tarragona]] - Old Roman period capital of eastern Spain, and today small seaside city off the tourist trail compared to Barcelona.\\n* Visit the [[Nature parks in Barcelona province]].\\n{{routebox\\n| image3=C-16.svg\\n| imagesize3=50\\n| directionl3=N\\n| majorl3=[[Image:Tabliczka E9.svg|30px]] [[Girona Pyrenees]]\\n| minorl3=[[Terrassa]]\\n| directionr3=S\\n| minorr3=\\n| majorr3=ENDS AT VIA AUGUSTA\\n}}\\n\\n{{related|Ferries in the Mediterranean}}\\n\\n{{IsPartOf|Barcelona (province)}}\\n{{geo|41.3879|2.1699|zoom=12}}\\n{{usablecity}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Stockholm Marathon 2009d banner.jpg}}\\nThe '''Marathon''' is a classic long-distance [[running|foot race]]; the standard distance is 42.195&nbsp;km (26 miles, 385 yards) though there is some variation between courses. The awkward distance was fixed for the first time for the 1908 Olympic games in London \\u2014 as legend has it to ensure a final stretch in front of the Royal Box as well as a starting point at Windsor Castle.\\n\\nMore than 500 marathon races are held annually, most of them as road races, though the distance can also be pursued cross-country. For the vast majority of runners, it is not so much a race as an endurance test; they will be happy just to finish, whatever their time, though many compete with themselves hoping to beat their previous times. For others, it is very much a competitive sport; there are substantial cash prizes for some races and the marathon has been an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] event since 1896. By tradition, the medals for the men's marathon are always the final ones to be awarded at the Summer Olympics, with its medal ceremony being incorporated into the closing ceremony. In the 21st century, marathons have a tendency to be dominated by runners from [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]], though [[Japan]] is also a powerhouse in women's marathons.\\n\\nThe name commemorates the battle of Marathon in 490 BC; the Athenians and some allies soundly defeated a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] invasion force that had just come off ships near the small town of [[Marathon (Greece)|Marathon]]. According to legend, an army messenger ran non-stop to [[Athens]] with the happy news and dropped dead immediately after delivering it. The length of the race is based on the legend and his most likely route. This may not be entirely accurate since a runner might have taken a shorter but hillier alternate route, and the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had horses so they might not have sent a runner at all.\\n\\nThere are '''ultramarathon''' races which cover even longer distances. Perhaps the most challenging footrace of all is the [https://www.marathondessables.com/en Marathon des Sables]{{Dead link|date=October 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} (Marathon of the Sands), 250 km (156 miles) across part of the Sahara Desert in [[Morocco]].\\n\\nThere is also a triathlon called [https://www.ironman.com/ Ironman]; despite the name, women do compete in this event, and the best of them are faster than most men. It starts with  a 4&nbsp;km swim, then 180&nbsp;km of [[cycling]] and finally running a marathon distance. There are several dozen events a year and an annual Ironman World Championship in [[Hawaii]].\\n\\n==Destinations==\\n[[File:'Helsinki City Marathon l\\u00e4ht\\u00f6.JPG|thumb|Helsinki City Marathon in 2012]]\\nMany cities host large and prestigious marathons, each attracting top marathoners and huge crowds of non-professional runners.

There is also a [[w:List of marathon races|list on Wikipedia]].\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n\\nMany people travel for marathons, so lodging selection is important.  For major marathons the influx of visitors can overwhelm local lodging options, so plan to book well in advance.  Marathons will typically involve shutting down the roads along the course, so transportation to the starting line on race day can be tricky - if you can book a hotel that is close to public transit or near the starting line your marathon experience is likely to be much less stressful.\\n\\nParticularly if you aren't an experienced marathoner, expect to feel pretty brutalized after completing the course.  Most people won't want to spend hours driving or on a plane immediately after putting their body through twenty-six miles of punishment, so booking a hotel for multiple nights - at least the night before and the night after the marathon - is a plan that you are unlikely to regret.\\n\\n==Stay healthy==\\nAccording to legend, the first marathon runner dropped dead just after finishing the run. That story may not be accurate, but certainly a marathon puts considerable strain on the body. No-one should attempt the race, or even serious training for it, without first talking to their doctor.\\n\\nThere are two water-related dangers; [[dehydration]] is uncomfortable, debilitating and dangerous, quite definitely not good for you. On the other hand excessive consumption of fluids can lead to [[hyponatraemia]], a reduction of sodium levels in the blood that is ''sometimes fatal for long-distance runners''.\\n\\nMany competitors find it necessary to work out a detailed '''hydration plan''' in advance so that they can avoid both dehydration and hyponatraemia on race day. Doing this right requires precise advice tailored to your body; '''consult a doctor''' with expertise in sports medicine.\\n\\nSome marathons are run at high altitudes; for those, [[altitude sickness]] is an issue. Anyone should at least give themselves a few days to acclimatize before the race, and adjust their hydration plan since altitude can also cause dehydration.

Built by Gustave Eiffel in 1887-1889, the tower was almost torn down in 1909 and only saved due to its use as a telegraphy antenna. The queues can be very long. The tower allows online reservations at its website. You can select a date and time frame. If you miss the time on your ticket, you have lost your money. The north, west, and east pillars have elevators that go to the first and second floors; the south pillar has stairs that can be climbed to the second floor. To reach the top floor, an additional elevator ride is required, and the wait for this can be very long as well. Disabled visitors are not allowed beyond the second floor due to safety concerns. Taking the M\\u00e9tro as far as Ecole Militiare and then strolling up the Champ de Mars is a lovely way to arrive at the tower. Another phenomenal approach is to exit the Metro at Trocadero and see the Eiffel Tower from the other side of the Ecole Militaire.\\n}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=l'Assembl\\u00e9e Nationale | alt= | url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/ | email=\\n| address=33, quai d'Orsay | lat=48.862192 | long=2.318716 | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 40 63 60 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=M F Sa 08:40-11:40 and 14:00-17:00 | price=\\n| wikipedia=National Assembly (France) | image=Paris Assemblee Nationale DSC00074.jpg | wikidata=Q193582\\n| content=Guided tours conducted all day, ID required.

Its walled town is a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]]. The old town is an outstanding example of a medieval city, built on the steep sides of a mountain. The many ''casas colgadas'' (\\\"hanging houses\\\") are built right up to the cliff edge, making Cuenca one of the most striking towns in Spain.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n\\nCuenca is found between [[Madrid]] and [[Valencia (City)|Valencia]], in the third least populated region in Europe. It was home to about 55,000 people in 2018.\\n\\nCuenca sits across a steep spur, whose slopes descend into deep gorges of the J\\u00facar and Hu\\u00e9car rivers. It is divided into two separate settlements: the \\\"new\\\" city is situated south-west of the old one, which is divided by the Hu\\u00e9car course.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n\\nWinters are relatively cold, but summers are quite hot during the day with occasional cool nights. Spring and autumn seasons are short, with pleasant temperatures during the day but with rather cold nights due to its altitude from 956 m (3,136 ft) above sea level up to 1,000 m (3,281 ft) in the old town.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By train===\\nThere are 2 railway stations in Cuenca. \\\"Traditional\\\" regional trains arrive to the \\\"Estaci\\u00f3n de Cuenca\\\" (~2 hr 50 min from Madrid) at the town centre.

Quite up-market and quiet, it is the largest arrondissement by both area and population. Housing over 230,000 inhabitants and providing around 150,000 jobs, it is dense with residential and office developments, including the high rise skyline of ''Front de Seine'' along the northern part of the 15th's bank of the river. On the other hand, it sees relatively little tourist traffic \\u2014 but that does not mean it is devoid of attractions.\\n\\nThe famous skyscraper ''Tour Montparnasse'' and the neighbouring railway station ''Gare Montparnasse'' are on the eastern border of the 15th arrondissement, although the actual district of ''Montparnasse'' is right across the border in the [[Paris/14th arrondissement|14th arrondissement]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Paris 15e arrondissement - Quartiers.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|The four administrative quarters of the 15th arrondissement]]\\nThe 15th arrondissement is further broken up administratively into four ''quartiers'': Grenelle, Necker, Saint-Lambert and Javel.\\n\\n'''Grenelle''' is the quarter closest to the [[Paris/7th arrondissement|7th arrondissement]] and thus directly neighbouring the ''Champ de Mars'' and the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, it houses many hotels advertising the proximity of the Tower. The waterfront part of Grenelle is home to the 1970s high-rise residential development of ''Beaugrenelle'', and the eponymous shopping mall. The more inland parts of the quarter are filled with 19th-century ''Haussmannian'' buildings, interspersed with some more modern ones.\\n\\nThe quarter of '''Necker''', situated between Grenelle and the quarter of ''Montparnasse'' of the [[Paris/14th arrondissement|14th arrondissement]], is home to some of the locations named after Montparnasse, most notably the ''Tour Montparnasse'' and ''Gare Montparnasse''. It also houses more large public service and commercial buildings, such as the expansive ''H\\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades''. Otherwise, it is full of late 20th-century residential buildings, with many fewer Haussmannian structures than Grenelle.\\n\\nThe southeast quarter of '''Saint-Lambert''' is most known for the ''Parc des expositions de la porte de Versailles'', which is one of the largest and most important exhibition centres in France and Europe.\\n\\nThe southwestern '''quartier Javel''' had long been an industrial area of Paris, but has been reclaimed as office, residential, and recreational over the decades. It contains the ''Parc Andr\\u00e9 Citro\\u00ebn'', created over the former Citro\\u00ebn factory grounds, and the Heliport of Paris in its southern extremity.<!--The 15th, the largest arrondissement of central Paris, remains heavily residential, up-market and quiet - not a great deal of obvious attractions for the traveller here, apart from the Montparnasse Tower (Tour Montparnasse). Some parts of the arrondissement are close to the Eiffel Tower which actually is in the 7th. Other sights include the Montparnasse Cemetery where Jean-Paul Sartre and Charles Baudelaire are buried, Theatre de la Gaite, and Theatre du Montparnasse.

The city covers 132 sq mi (343&nbsp;km\\u00b2), but [[Central Georgia|Metro Atlanta]], which includes 28 counties, has an area of 8,376 sq mi (21,693.7&nbsp;km\\u00b2). The '''Chattahoochee River''', which forms the northwestern boundary of Atlanta, is a major source of water throughout the metro area. Aside from the river, the topography of Atlanta is assorted with rolling hills, forests, lakes and ponds, and granite '''Stone Mountain''' to the east.\\n\\nIn 2020, Atlanta had 500,000 residents within the city limits and 6.3 million in the metro area. \\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Imperial\\n| janhigh = 54.0\\n| febhigh = 58.2\\n| marhigh = 65.9\\n| aprhigh = 73.8\\n| mayhigh = 81.1\\n| junhigh = 87.1\\n| julhigh = 90.1\\n| aughigh = 89.0\\n| sephigh = 83.9\\n| octhigh = 74.4\\n| novhigh = 64.1\\n| dechigh = 56.2\\n| janlow = 35.6\\n| feblow = 38.9\\n| marlow = 45.3\\n| aprlow = 52.5\\n| maylow = 61.3\\n| junlow = 68.6\\n| jullow = 71.8\\n| auglow = 71.3\\n| seplow = 65.9\\n| octlow = 54.9\\n| novlow = 44.2\\n| declow = 38.4\\n| janprecip = 4.59\\n| febprecip = 4.55\\n| marprecip = 4.68\\n| aprprecip = 3.81\\n| mayprecip = 3.56\\n| junprecip = 4.54\\n| julprecip = 4.75\\n| augprecip = 4.30\\n| sepprecip = 3.82\\n| octprecip = 3.28\\n| novprecip = 3.98\\n| decprecip = 4.57\\n| description = {{ForecastNOAA|Atlanta|33.75003|-84.39113}}\\n}}\\nAtlanta is on the Piedmont Plateau, at an approximate elevation of 700&ndash;1100&nbsp;ft (220&ndash;330&nbsp;m) <!-- actually 738-1086 ft, source: http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/Elevations-Distances/elvadist.html --> above sea level. The city is thus somewhat cooler than other places in the U.S. South, a fact that certainly helped the growth of the city before the introduction of air conditioning.\\n\\nAtlanta experiences a very wide range of temperatures. Temperatures in winter are overall mild to warm, but cold-fronts can bring light accumulations of snow and lows occasionally plummet into the teens.  However, days are usually in the 50s F (10 \\u00b0C) and nights in the low to mid 30s F (0 \\u00b0C). Ice-storms are very rare, but not unheard of. Rainfall is high in late winter and early spring, and afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer. Spring and autumn are the best times to visit. The region is often affected during hurricane season (June through November) from remnants that spill out from the Gulf, bringing heavy rains and sometimes high winds.\\n\\nSummers are hot and humid, with temperatures frequently reaching above 90 \\u00b0F (32 \\u00b0C), thus the city earning the nickname \\\"Hotlanta\\\" (a name which makes locals cringe, and will likely be met with a retort of \\\"Nobody calls it that\\\"). Heat indices average around {{F|92}} during the day and {{F|73}} at night, but can climb above {{F|103}} and not go below {{F|77}} on some particuarly sweltering days.\\n\\n===History===\\nAtlanta began taking shape in 1837 when the Western & Atlantic Railroad selected the site as the southern end of its tracks. The town was called Terminus until 1843 when it was renamed Marthasville after the daughter of Gov. Wilson Lumpkin. In 1847, the city was renamed Atlanta, supposedly a feminine form of \\\"Atlantic\\\", probably created by an engineer with the Western & Atlantic. The city was incorporated in 1847.\\n\\nBy the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, Atlanta was a major '''railroad hub''', manufacturing center, and supply depot. But in 1864, to cripple transportation between the South and the North, Union General William T. Sherman's army '''burned to the ground''' all of the railroad facilities, almost every business and more than two-thirds of the city's homes during his infamous \\\"March to the Sea.\\\" Atlanta lay in ruins, the only major American city ever destroyed by war.\\n\\nAtlanta's first resurgence began soon after. Within four years of Sherman's attack, the Georgia capital was moved from Milledgeville to Atlanta and a drive to attract new business was underway. In the meantime, colleges and universities began to open, telephones were introduced, and trolleys began to roll. In 1895, the Cotton States and International Exposition in Piedmont Park showed 800,000 visitors and residents that Atlanta was headed in a new direction and braced for the 20th century.\\n\\nBy the late 1920s, a downtown business sector had taken shape, giving Atlanta much of the distinct pattern it maintains today. At the same time, Atlanta Alderman (and later Mayor) William B. Hartsfield campaigned long and hard to convince the city to turn a vacant racetrack into an airport. Today, Hartsfield\\u2013Jackson International Airport is the '''world's busiest airport''', with more than 100 million annual passengers.\\n\\nWhile the city continued its economic surge, it also became known as the '''\\\"City Too Busy to Hate.\\\"''' Atlanta and Georgia preempted much of the strife associated with the 1950s and 1960s by taking the lead in the Southeast in strengthening minority rights. The city's strongest identification with the movement was through its native son, '''Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'''\\n\\nMuch has been accomplished in the last 25 years to elevate Atlanta to world-class status. An efficient (by the standards of the Southern US at least) public transportation system, MARTA, was put in place; Underground Atlanta was added to the entertainment map; the Georgia World Congress Center made the city a convention hub; the Georgia Dome was built in 1992; and Philips Arena was built in 1999. The Dome was torn down in 2017 once its replacement, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, opened.\\n\\nFrom July 20 through August 4, 1996, all eyes were on Atlanta as it hosted the '''Centennial Olympic Games'''. The city successfully hosted the biggest Olympic Games ever, showcasing itself to 2 million people in person and 3.5 billion people through global broadcast.\\n\\nThe Olympics served as a catalyst for a second resurgence of Atlanta as it experiences a dramatic transformation from great American city to greater international city by fueling more than $6 billion in development and changes.\\n\\nAtlanta has become a major '''conference and convention destination''', due mostly to the enormous airport and favorable weather. Most of the conference venues are near the Peachtree Center MARTA station in downtown, and when there is a large show in town, it can sometimes seem as though every other person in the city is wearing a name tag.\\n\\n===Watch===\\nAtlanta\\u2019s southern culture, deep history, and bustling city have been the backdrop for numerous classic films.\\n*''Gone with the Wind'' (Victor Fleming, 1939).

A coming of age drama set in the hip-hop culture of the modern city.\\n\\nAtlanta is also the background for the popular television shows ''The Walking Dead'' and ''Atlanta''.\\n\\nAtlanta (and the rest of Georgia) have quickly become a favorite filming location thanks to state tax incentives. You can catch glimpses of Atlanta landmarks in movies like ''The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'' (Francis Lawrence, 2013) where it plays the decadent capital city, and ''The Internship'' (Shawn Levy, 2013) where it plays Google's high-tech modernist headquarters.\\n\\n===Visitor information===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau | alt=Atlanta Visitor Information | url=http://discoveratlanta.c | email=\\n| address=233 Peachtree Street, NE | lat=33.76072 | long=-84.38667 | directions=Underground Atlanta\\n| phone=+1 404-521-6600 | tollfree=+1-800-285-2682\\n| hours=M-Sa 10AM-6PM, Su noon-6PM | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{Mapframe|zoom=auto}}\\n\\n[[Image:Hartsfield-Jackson Airport overview.jpg|240px|thumb|If you fly into Atlanta, you'll be touching down at the busiest airport in the world: Hartsfield\\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport]]\\n\\n===By plane===\\n{{main|Hartsfield\\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport}}\\n\\nAtlanta's principal airport is {{marker|type=go|name=Atlanta Hartsfield\\u2013Jackson International Airport|url=http://www.atlanta-airport.com|lat=33.6409|long=-84.4323}} ({{IATA|ATL}}) (\\\"Hartsfield\\u2013Jackson,\\\" \\\"ATL,\\\" or just \\\"the airport\\\" to locals), about {{mi|8}} south of downtown.

However, having a car in Downtown is often a hindrance where parking is scarce, and the lengthy rush hour is an exercise in frustration.\\n\\n'''Street names''' in Atlanta are very confusing. There are more than 70 streets that have \\\"Peachtree\\\" in their name, and they are often difficult to distinguish (Peachtree Street, Peachtree Lane, West Peachtree Street, etc.) When someone says \\\"Peachtree\\\" without clarifying, they mean '''Peachtree Street''', a major north-south thoroughfare through Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead. Do not confuse it with '''West Peachtree Street''', which parallels Peachtree Street a block away and is a major road through Midtown. Additionally, many thoroughfares change street names frequently, generally at intersections and curves.\\n\\nPonce de Leon Avenue, often shortened to Ponce, is pronounced ''PAHNS duh LEE-ahn''.\\n\\n===By foot===\\nVisitors will find today's Atlanta very walkable, with many improvements made in the last decade. Most of the in-town neighborhoods are individually easy to walk around, with dense collections of bars, restaurants, and shops. In particular, getting around within Midtown, Downtown, Decatur, Buckhead, or the areas around the North Highland Avenue corridor in East Atlanta (including Virginia-Highland, Poncey Highland, and Little Five Points) is usually quite easy; walking times rarely exceed 10&ndash;20 minutes, and buses or trains provide some relief for longer trips. Getting ''between'' those neighborhoods solely by foot is more difficult; for example, expect a 30&ndash;45-minute walk between Midtown and Virginia-Highland. Inter-neighborhood transportation is best done by car or public transit.\\n\\n===By transit===\\n[[Image:Marta sign.jpg|thumb|right|Look for these characteristic MARTA signs]]\\n\\nAtlanta is served by '''[http://www.itsmarta.com MARTA]''' (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority), {{phone|+1 404-848-4711}}, which operates rapid rail and bus networks in the city of Atlanta and the counties of Fulton and Dekalb. Locals just say \\\"MARTA\\\"; referring to it as \\\"the MARTA\\\" will mark you as an out-of-towner.\\n\\n[[Image:Breeze Card.JPG|thumb|right|Breeze Card]]\\n\\nA single ride on MARTA costs $2.50 (children 46 inches and under free, up to 2 per adult); the fare includes transfers. MARTA uses wireless Breeze Cards to store your fare; a new card costs $2.00 but is reloadable and valid for 10 years. (Breeze Cards can't be shared; you need one per person.) Breeze Cards are sold in vending machines at all rail stations or at RideStores at Airport, Lindbergh Center, and Five Points Stations (vending machines accept credit cards, but cash may be faster as the machines are slow and prone to breaking). On the bus, tap the card at the fare post next to the driver. At the train station, tap on entry and exit at the fare gate. When transferring, tap your card again. (The card uses RFID technology, so you can leave it in your wallet and just tap your whole wallet on the sensor.)\\n\\nBuses accept fares in cash, but cannot issue transfers on fares paid in cash &mdash; you must have a Breeze Card to obtain the transfer. If you plan to make a connection, make sure to get one before starting your trip.\\n\\nUnlimited passes are available ($9 for 1 day, $19 for 4 days, $23.75 for 7 days).  These will easily save you money if you plan on making more than one or two trips per day.\\n\\n'''MARTA runs slower on the weekends'''; typical wait times are 20 minutes for trains and up to an hour for buses. Be sure to accommodate for this.\\n\\nThe system is quite safe regardless of the time of day, although there have been a handful of incidents of violent crime in the last decade<!--when?-->. Like in any other city or transit system, use common sense, keep aware of your surroundings during low ridership periods, and avoid train cars with no other riders or with only a couple of other riders.\\n\\n====Rail====\\nThe rail network consists of four lines: Red, Gold, Blue, and Green.  The Red and Gold lines run north-south, while the Blue and Green lines run east-west, forming a cross with Five Points Station in the center as the only connection point between the Red-Gold and Blue-Green lines.\\n* The Red and Gold lines run on the same rails from a southern terminus at Hartsfield-Jackson airport through Downtown and Midtown Atlanta, before splitting into two branches: the Red line runs to north metro Atlanta at North Springs Station, and the Gold line runs northeast and terminates at Doraville Station.\\n* The Blue line runs from a western terminal at Hamilton E.&nbsp;Holmes to an eastern terminal at Indian Creek. The Green line runs east-west along with the Blue line, but has a small spur to Bankhead station and only goes as far east as Edgewood/Candler Park station.\\nTrains run M-F 5AM-1AM, and on weekends and holidays 5AM-12:30AM. Trains run on all lines every 12 minutes during peak periods, and every 20 minutes at night and on weekends. The wait is often shorter than this for trips in the center of the city, as you will not have to wait for any specific train; you could take either the Red line or the Gold line to get from Downtown to Midtown, for example.\\n\\n====Bus====\\nThe bus network comprises over 100 different bus routes, with many routes operating approximately every 20 minutes. Bus service on some lines (generally including the most popular tourist areas) runs M-F 5AM-1:30AM, and on the weekends and holidays 5AM-1AM.\\n\\nThere are a few buses which are particularly useful for getting around some of the in-town neighborhoods:\\n*'''[http://www.itsmarta.com/BusSchedules_StreetMap.aspx?route=110 110 \\\"The Peach\\\"]''' &ndash; This bus traverses Peachtree Street/Road from Downtown to Buckhead. Although most trips along this corridor will be easier and faster using the train, this bus is still especially useful for getting to a destination between Arts Center Station and Buckhead, including the Buckhead Village, which is 20-minute walk from Buckhead Station.\\n*'''[http://www.itsmarta.com/BusSchedules_StreetMap.aspx?route=36 36]''' &ndash; Useful connection to Virginia-Highland from Midtown Station. Beyond Virginia-Highland, this bus continues north and then east, stopping at Emory University, then traversing many residential neighborhoods before ending at Avondale Station east of Decatur.\\n*'''[http://www.itsmarta.com/BusSchedules_StreetMap.aspx?route=2 2]''' &ndash; Leaves from North Avenue Station heading east and operates on two slightly different routes. Most of these follow Ponce de Leon Avenue and head briefly south and east along North Highland Avenue and Freedom Parkway before going along Moreland Avenue (through Little Five Points) and continuing to Edgewood/Candler Park Station. Once an hour, however, the bus will continue along Ponce (instead of turning down North Highland Avenue) and eventually reach Decatur Station. This route is useful for getting to parts of North Highland Avenue and to Little Five Points (both of which will be short walks regardless of which route the bus takes), and the hourly detour can be useful as well for reaching parts of Decatur which are further removed from the MARTA station.\\n*'''[http://www.itsmarta.com/BusSchedules_StreetMap.aspx?route=12 12]''' &ndash; Leaves from Midtown Station and heads west along 10th Street past Georgia Tech. Turns north along Howell Mill Road and continues into far northwestern parts of the city. This can be useful for getting to the west end of Georgia Tech campus or for getting to the West Midtown district (near Howell Mill and Marietta Street and continuing for some time along Howell Mill). The redevelopment of this district began in the1990s, and it now has many restaurants, boutique shops, bars, coffee shops, and art galleries.\\n*'''[http://www.itsmarta.com/BusSchedules_StreetMap.aspx?route=6 6]''' &ndash; Runs from Inman Park Station in the east to Lindbergh Station in the north. It first travels along Moreland Avenue (which becomes Briarcliff Road, on which it continues) with stops in Little Five Points (providing a shortcut there if the 10- to 15-minute walk is too much) offering short walks to much of Poncey Highlands. It also has stops at Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control.\\n\\n====Streetcar====\\nDowntown, the [https://www.itsmarta.com/Atlanta-Street-Car-Info.aspx Atlanta Streetcar] has brought streetcars back to Atlanta, 65 years after the previous service ended. The Downtown Loop runs east-west, connecting Centennial Olympic Park, Peachtree Center MARTA station, and going across the highway to the Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site. It's cheaper than MARTA (adults $1, children free [46 inches and under, up to 2 per adult]; multiple trip passes available), but the limited destinations mean visitors may not get much use from it.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\nIt is usually possible to flag taxicabs down near tourist attractions and bars in Midtown and Downtown.  However, calling ahead is recommended.\\n\\n'''24-hour taxicab services:'''\\n*'''[http://www.atlantacheckercab.com/ Checker Cab]''', {{phone|+1 404-351-1111}}\\n*'''[http://www.easyridertaxiservice.com/ Easy Rider Taxi]{{Dead link|date=September 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}''', {{phone|+1 404-391-2798}}\\n\\nTaxis between the airport and major areas of town are [http://apps.atl.com/Passenger/GroundTransportation/Default.aspx flat rate].\\nBe sure to insist on the flat rate, even if the driver claims no knowledge of it.\\n\\nYou can also use ride-hailing apps such as [https://www.uber.com/cities/atlanta Uber] and Lyft. Be aware the pricing can be high during times of high demand.\\n\\n===By car===\\n'''Cars''' are the most popular form of transport to get around the sprawling city, and usually the fastest during non-peak hours.  Many destinations outside the urban centers are only accessible by car.  Rush hour peaks around 7:30AM\\u20139:30AM and 4PM-6:30PM on weekdays and often results in congestion when traveling inbound in the mornings and outbound in the afternoons.  Downtown/Midtown and major shopping districts such as Buckhead can also get crowded on weekends. In most of the city, '''parking''' is free and plentiful. In the most urban areas, some restaurants offer free or cheap valet services ($1\\u20133 tip expected) and on the rare occasion where parking is scarce, public lots are usually nearby for a fee.

The Michael C. Carlos Museum on the campus of Emory University is an excellent attraction for those interested in the Greek and Egyptian cultures. The museum houses the largest collection of Greek, Egyptian and Near Eastern artifacts in the Southeast.

A building boom has left Atlanta glittering with dazzling glass skyscrapers, many of which contain some of the most expensive condominiums in the country. That said, the city owes a sizeable portion of its modern cityscape to home-grown architect John Portman.

The city's eclectic shopping neighborhoods include downtown Atlanta, Little Five Points, Virginia-Highland, Buckhead and Midtown.\\n\\nLooking for antiques and art? [http://www.miamicircleshops.com/ The Miami Circle], [http://www.buckhead.org/bennettstreet/ Bennett Street]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}, and [http://www.galleriesofpeachtreehills.com/ The Galleries of Peachtree Hills] offer some of the best merchandise in Atlanta.\\n\\nBuckhead is home to more than 1,400 retail stores. [http://www.simon.com/mall/lenox-square Lenox Square] and [http://www.simon.com/mall/phipps-plaza Phipps Plaza] offer the most concentrated collection of upscale stores available anywhere in the city including Neiman Marcus, Tiffany & Co., Jil Sander, Gucci, Cartier, Burberry, Jimmy Choo and Louis Vuitton. The Midtown Mile is a stretch of Peachtree Street in Midtown that offers street level retail shopping. [http://www.atlanticstation.com/ Atlantic Station] also offers plenty of retail options.\\n\\nIf your interest lies in smaller, specialty, boutique or vintage stores, try Little Five Points, Virginia-Highland, and East Atlanta Village. '''Criminal Records''' & '''Wax 'N Facts''' are popular stores in Little Five Points that still sell vinyl records. '''Bill Hallman Boutiques''' are also a neighborhood staple, providing fashion forward clothing for Atlanta's social set.\\n\\n[[Atlanta/Five Points|Underground Atlanta]] is six city blocks in the heart of downtown Atlanta transformed into a spirited marketplace that offers historic guided tours and features restaurants, specialty stores, entertainment emporiums and street-cart merchants.\\n\\nStreet vendors are common in Downtown, especially in the Five Points neighborhood. You can also find large assortment of trade retailers at AmericasMart.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n''See the [[#Districts|Districts]] articles for more listings.''\\n\\nAffordability, variety of restaurants, culinary diversity and award-winning chefs are key ingredients that earn Atlanta a place at the table with other popular culinary cities. An assortment of neighborhoods offers an array of restaurants featuring cuisine that spans the globe, serving something for every taste.\\n\\nIf you want to plumb the depths of what Atlanta's restaurant scene offers, do what locals do and sift through local magazine ''[https://creativeloafing.com/where%20to%20eat Creative Loafing]''. They review restaurants all over the city, and have several lists of '''[https://creativeloafing.com/100-Dishes-to-Eat-in-Atlanta-2019 \\\"100 Dishes to Eat in Atlanta\\\"]'''.\\n\\nDuring the past few years, several '''celebrity chefs''' have traveled south to call Atlanta home. Drawn to the quickly growing culinary scene, these chefs have been welcomed with open arms and some true southern hospitality. Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Anne Quatrano ([[Atlanta/West#Eat|Bacchanalia]] and Floataway Cafe), and Richard Blais (FLIP Burger Boutique, and One Midtown Kitchen) are just a few.\\n\\nWhat better place to travel than to the heart of Atlanta to experience '''classic and contemporary Southern cuisine''' at its finest? '''[[Atlanta/Midtown#Eat|Mary Mac's Tea Room]]''' has been serving \\\"meat and three\\\" for close to 70 years, and has photos in every room to prove it, while innovators like Canoe, JCT, Restaurant Eugene, and South City Kitchen update Southern cuisine for the 21st century.\\n\\nA [http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB117348069193432668 ''Wall Street Journal'' article] in 2007 named Atlanta the best city in the U.S. for '''burgers'''. Their top pick went to '''[[East_Atlanta_Village#Eat|Ann's Snack Bar]]''', an 8-seat dive run by one woman. '''[[Atlanta/Little_Five_Points#Eat|The Vortex]]''' and '''[[East_Atlanta_Village#Drink|The Earl]]''' were also listed, and are better choices if you don't have several hours to spend waiting in line. There are dozens of other highly-rated relative newcomers to the burger scene.\\n\\nAtlanta is also making a name for itself in '''pizza''' of almost every style. For gourmet Neapolitan-style pizza, '''Antico Pizza Napoletana''' and '''Varasano's''' are invariably named among the best, but opinions are divided about which is the top. Other gourmet pizzerias include Ammazza, Double Zero, and Fritti, to name just a few. If you're looking for less-pretentious 'za, check out Blue Moon Pizza, Cameli's, Fellini's, Nina &amp; Rafi, or Rocky Mountain Pizza.\\n\\nOf course, you can stick with the '''landmarks''', such as '''[[Atlanta/Midtown#Eat|The Varsity]]''' (the world's largest drive-in), '''[[Atlanta/Downtown#Eat|The Sun Dial]]''' (a restaurant on top of the Westin Hotel), [[Atlanta/Downtown#Eat|Pittypat's Porch]] (Southern charm inspired by ''Gone With the Wind''), or [[Atlanta/Buckhead#Eat|R. Thomas]] (healthy meals including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free).\\n\\nYou might be surprised to learn that Atlanta is home to the headquarters of ''many'' restaurant chains. Some are small regional or Atlanta-only chains such as '''[http://www.flyingbiscuit.com/ Flying Biscuit Caf\\u00e9]''', '''[http://www.taqueriadelsol.com/ Taqueria del Sol]''', '''[http://www.figopasta.com/ Figo Pasta]''', '''[https://tindrumasiankitchen.com/ Tin Drum Asiacaf\\u00e9]''', and '''[https://willys.com/ Willy's Mexicana Grill]'''. The iconically Southern chains '''[http://www.wafflehouse.com/ Waffle House]''' and '''[http://www.chick-fil-a.com/ Chick-Fil-A]''' got their start in Atlanta, as did [http://www.mellowmushroom.com/ '''Mellow Mushroom''',] [http://moes.com/ '''Moe's Southwest Grill'''], and national chain restaurant [https://www.applebees.com/ '''Applebee's''']. Other chains just find Atlanta to be a great business home, including [http://www.tedsmontanagrill.com/ '''Ted's Montana Grill'''] (founded by Atlanta media mogul Ted Turner), [http://www.arbys.com/ '''Arby's'''], and [http://www.krystal.com/ '''Krystal'''].\\n\\nThe dominant local grocery chains in Atlanta are Kroger, Publix, Aldi, and Lidl. The city is also dotted with dozens of ethnic groceries, especially Hispanic, Korean, Indian and Vietnamese. For organic and or specialty grocery stores, Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe's and Fresh Market also have locations throughout the city.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n===Coca-Cola===\\nIn much of the [[South (United States of America)|South]], thanks to the influence of Coca-Cola being headquartered in [[Atlanta/Midtown|midtown Atlanta]], \\\"coke\\\" can colloquially refer to any soft drink in place of \\\"soda\\\" or \\\"pop\\\". Ordering \\\"a Coke\\\" at a restaurant usually, but not always, means you're asking for a Coca-Cola Classic (and they ''will'' ask \\\"Is Pepsi okay?\\\" if they don't serve Coca-Cola products), but if someone says they're going to the grocery store to buy \\\"some cokes\\\" for a party, they mean \\\"a variety of soft drinks\\\", not just Coca-Cola.\\n\\n===Sweet tea===\\nA true staple of southern culture, sweet tea can be found at almost any restaurant in Atlanta. In most places an order for \\\"tea\\\" will be assumed to mean \\\"sweet tea\\\"; hot or unsweetened tea need to be asked for specifically. A popular variant to a glass of sweet tea is an '''Arnold Palmer''', a half and half mix of iced tea (either sweetened or unsweetened) and lemonade, named after the famous golfer who popularized it.\\n\\n===Beer and more beer===\\nAtlanta is home to '''Sweetwater Brewing Company''', one of the largest microbreweries in the South; their 420 Extra Pale Ale is a signature item. '''Red Brick''' is the second-largest, while relative newcomers include Monday Night, Orpheus, Second Self, Three Taverns, and Wild Heaven.\\n\\n'''Beer bars''' are a big to-do in Atlanta. The most widely-known is local chain '''[http://tacomac.com/ Taco Mac]''', which boasts an ever-changing collection of as many as 140 beers on draught and hundreds more in bottles, with wings, burgers, and tacos to wash them down.  Not to be outdone, '''[[Atlanta/East|The Porter]]''' serves up 430 brews along with excellent gastropub food.  '''[[Decatur (Georgia)|Brick Store Pub]]''' offers over 20 beers for connoisseurs, plus an additional bar of Belgian beers in an upstairs alcove.  Serving up their own in-house brews, [[Atlanta/East|Wrecking Bar]] and [[Decatur (Georgia)|Twain's]] top the list of brewpubs.  Other local favorites for a good pint include [[Atlanta/Midtown|Publik Draft House]], [[Atlanta/Virginia-Highland|Book House]], [[Decatur (Georgia)|Thinking Man Tavern]], and [[Atlanta/Midtown|Cypress Street Pint & Plate]].\\n\\n===Nightlife===\\n\\n[[Image:The Vortex!.jpg|200px|thumb|Unique bars, restaurants and shops abound in the Little Five Points neighborhood]]\\n\\nWith fun and unique attractions, renowned restaurants and top-of-the-line hotel experiences, Atlanta keeps the party going from day to night. With chic style in [[Atlanta/Buckhead|Buckhead]], alternative scene in [[Atlanta/Little Five Points|Little Five Points]], a casual atmosphere in [[Atlanta/Virginia-Highland|Virginia-Highland]] and a trendy vibe in [[Atlanta/Midtown|Midtown]], Atlanta nightlife suits every style of letting loose. Since each district has so many options, you will want to visit each district article for a more detailed listing.\\n\\nBuckhead is still the most popular nightlife district for locals and out-of-towners alike. The Buckhead clientele is mostly of an upscale crowd, so be sure to dress to impress.\\n\\nMidtown is the spot if you're looking for the urban vibe with diverse a crowd of 20s and 30s, many of them are college students, locals, transplants from out of state and foreign countries. This is also a gay and lesbian friendly area.\\n\\n[[Atlanta/Downtown|Downtown]] has a few options for nightlife as well. Many of the Downtown watering holes can be found in [http://www.underground-atlanta.com/nightlife/kennys-alley.html Kenny's Alley] in Underground. The [[Atlanta/Fairlie-Poplar|Fairlie-Poplar]] district has a few neighborhood bars as well. [http://www.statsatl.com/ Stats] is an ideal sports bar to watch a game near Centennial Olympic Park.\\n\\nOther popular clubs throughout the city include [http://www.masq.com/ The Masquerade] and MJQ Concourse. All areas of the city also have plenty of pubs and taverns, such as [http://www.fadoirishpub.com/atlanta/ Fado Irish Pub] in Buckhead, [http://www.shakespearetavern.com/ Shakespeare Tavern] in Midtown, and [http://www.nightcapfoodandspirits.com/highlandtapmain.html Highland Tap] in Virginia-Highland.\\n\\nIf you like country line-dancing, you can head out of the city and into the suburbs and check out [http://www.wildbillsatlanta.com/ Wild Bills] in [[Duluth (Georgia)|Duluth]].\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n''See the [[Atlanta#Districts|Districts]] articles for more listings.''\\n\\nMost of Atlanta's major hotels are [[Atlanta/Downtown|downtown]] between '''Five Points''' and '''Midtown''' in area with a name that is easy to remember: the Hotel District. The district is in the heart of Atlanta's economic and political center and is within walking distance to many of the major tourist attractions, including the Centennial Olympic Park, the World of Coca-Cola, the Georgia Aquarium, and  the CNN Center.\\n\\nRapidly growing '''Midtown''', the center of Atlanta's business district as well as many high-rise luxury condos is nearby many museums and theaters. If you're looking for boutique hotels that are near a thriving urban setting, Midtown may be the area for you.\\n\\nOnce the heart of Atlanta's nightlife, '''Buckhead''' is still home to several upscale hotels, which are close to the area's shopping and dining districts.\\n\\nIf you're staying in Atlanta without a car, you'll have the best time if you stay around Midtown or Downtown, which offer central, easy access to MARTA. Both areas have many excellent bars, restaurants, and cultural attractions accessible by foot. The big-name hotels in these parts of town are close to train stations and bus routes, making access to most interesting parts of town quick and hassle-free. Buckhead and Decatur are other options with good access to transit, but not as many tourist attractions in the area (and in the case of Decatur, not many hotels to choose from).\\n\\nIf you plan on renting an apartment, good places to look include Midtown a few blocks from Peachtree Street between the Arts Center and North Avenue MARTA stations, and around North Highland Avenue south of Virginia Avenue (including Little Five Points).\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nDespite Atlanta's historic reputation for crime, the city is not as dangerous as many perceive it to be. In fact, Atlanta's crime rate dropped significantly during the 1990s and 2000s, reaching a forty-year low in 2005. While violent crime levels are still high compared to most American cities, most of it is related to the drug trade and takes place in parts of the city visitors rarely \\u2013 if ever \\u2013 see.\\n\\nUsual precautions should be taken, as in any other major city, such as not traveling alone at night and being aware of which neighborhoods are more prone to crime. In Atlanta, the southwest and southeast areas have reported the most incidents of crime; the triangle created by I-285, I-75, and I-20 in particular is a dangerous neighborhood. Avoid venturing in areas surrounding the new Mercedes-Benz stadium such as Bankhead and Vine City late at night. Car theft is exceptionally high by national standards. Outside of the perimeter, crime rates are significantly lower (except Dekalb County).\\n\\nOne thing to watch out for in Atlanta are homeless people, which have become an unfortunately prevalent sight since the 2000s. Whereas homeless people in big cities tend to leave you alone if you ignore them, those in Atlanta have been known to physically harass locals or tourists alike. Areas where the homeless tend to congregate most include the John Lewis Freedom Parkway, the areas south of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and northern Midtown.\\n\\n==Connect==\\nAtlanta area codes are '''404''', '''770''', '''678''', and '''470'''.  All 10 digits of the phone number are required when making local calls.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\n===Media===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' | url=https://www.ajc.com/ | email=\\n|

Its global reach allows people from all over the world to attend its races. Attending a race can be an adventure in itself, and a race-goer can expect to experience a new country and culture and interact with people from all around the world. Formula One visits roughly 20 countries on every continent except Africa.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nThe locations of Formula One racing remain fairly static throughout the year, with only the dates of the races subject to year on year changes. More countries have been hosting a Grand Prix, especially in Asia. Recent additions include circuits in [[Azerbaijan]], the [[Middle East]], [[Singapore]], the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]].\\n\\n===Weekend structure===\\nFormula One events take place over three days, referred to as 'the weekend', starting with practice sessions on Friday, qualifying on Saturday, and culminating with the race on Sunday. Monaco is normally the only exception to this, where the practice sessions are by tradition held one day earlier on the Thursday, leaving the Friday free. (In 2024, the Bahrain and Saudi Arabia races were rescheduled to Saturday to avoid conflicts with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.) The routine below outlines a normal non-sprint weekend:\\n\\n*'''Friday''' (Thursday in Monaco) kicks off the weekend with two 1-hour Free Practice sessions: one in the morning (FP1) and one in the early afternoon (FP2). Qualifying for some supporting championships may also occur in between or after the sessions.\\n*'''Saturday''' features the third and final Free Practice session in the morning (FP3) before the official qualifying session, which most often begins at 1PM local time. The qualifying lasts 60 minutes, after which support championships go back on track with either qualifying sessions or races depending on the category.\\n*'''Sunday''' is the busiest day of the weekend, comprising entirely of races. Support championship races will bookend the day, with the Formula One race beginning anywhere between 13:00 and 15:00 local time, depending on location (the Australian and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix begin late afternoon, the Singapore Grand Prix at 20:00). A Formula One race can last up to 2 hours of running time or 3 hours from race start (whichever comes first; red flag stops the running time), but barring delays or wet weather 70-90 minute races are expected.\\nAs of 2021, a new format that includes the Sprint has been introduced at some tracks. The routine below outlines a sprint weekend:\\n\\n*'''Friday''' kicks off the weekend with the only Free Practice session in the morning (FP1). Teams will make their best efforts to utilize the limited practice before Qualifying at the FP2 timeslot.\\n*'''Saturday''' is the Sprint day, kicked off with a Sprint Shootout (read: shortened Qualifying) at the FP3 timeslot, followed by a 100-km Sprint Race that lasts roughly a third of the main race on Sunday. Offers limited points for the Top 8 and pitstops are optional, however results from the Sprint Race do not affect the main race.\\n*'''Sunday''' works the same way as a normal non-sprint weekend.\\n\\n===Support races===\\nWith only six hours of action over three days, the crowd can get restless when the Formula One cars aren't racing around the track. However, the Formula One championship is joined by many other supporting championships over the weekend to keep the track alive. The races may be shorter and the cars may be slower, but don't discount the excitement (and carnage) they may bring.\\n*'''Formula 2 (F2)''' is the feeder series to F1 and is present at most European and Middle Eastern races. Formula 2 cars look like smaller versions of F1 cars and their drivers are eager to cut their teeth into world-class racing, as finishing well in this series helps to acquire the prestige and Super License points necessary to make it to F1. Formula 2 features 30-minute practice and qualifying sessions on Friday and Saturday respectively, and one race each on Saturday and Sunday. The series has a reputation of delivering future racing stars, and several of the current crop of F1 drivers, such as Lewis Hamilton, Lando Norris, Alexander Albon, and Charles Leclerc were once Formula 2 drivers.\\n*'''Formula 3 (F3)''' is a rung down from Formula 2, with young drivers getting their first taste of international racing. The series is present at most European races. Like Formula 2, there are 30-minute practice and qualifying sessions on the Friday and Saturday before two races on the Saturday and Sunday. While successful F3 drivers typically graduate to F2, a notable exception is current F1 series champion Max Verstappen, who went directly from F3 to F1.\\n*'''Porsche Supercup''' is a sports car series where all drivers compete in identical Porsche 911 GT3 Cup cars. Most current Porsche factory drivers have competed in Porsche Supercup.\\n\\n==Grand Prix locations==\\n===Americas===\\n====[[Canada]]====\\n[[File:Montreal F1.jpg|thumb|The hairpin (''L'Epingle'') at the ''Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve'' offers great viewing opportunities]]\\n'''Canadian Grand Prix''' - ''Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, [[Montr\\u00e9al]]''\\n*'''Date''': mid-June\\n*[http://www.circuitgillesvilleneuve.ca/billets/your-weekend-at-the-grand-prix-2014 '''Tickets'''] (2014): General Admission: $45.45 (F), $70.50 (Sa), $95.75 (Su), $126.00 (weekend); Grandstand: $267.50-560.00; 1 child under 11 per ticket-holding adult: Free\\n*Certainly one of the best venues on the calendar, the ''Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve'' often produces some of the best racing of the season.

Plenty of good viewing spots and compared to many tracks are quite close to the circuit's edge. General entry is good value with the most popular spot being Brocky's Hill at the back part of the circuit. It is advisable to take a picnic rug or foldable chair if choosing to sit there.\\n*'''Contact''': \\n\\n==Get in==\\n===Tickets===\\nEntry to a circuit requires a ticket. Tickets can be bought for the whole weekend (all three days) or for one specific day (they get more expensive as the weekend goes along). There are generally two types on sale:\\n*'''General admission''' tickets are the cheapest and most easily available, and they do not restrict the ticket-holder to a particular section of the track. Many circuits have viewing banks that general admission ticket-holders can use, although these fill up very quickly so get there early for a good spot. If the viewing areas are full then there are many parts where standing is available. These tickets do not give the comfort of grandstand tickets, so make sure adequate protection from the elements is brought along. The ground may be uneven or wet underfoot so bring suitable footwear and something to sit on.\\n*'''Grandstand''' tickets give the best view of a particular section of the track and often have a large screen in view so none of the action is missed. Ticket prices are scaled, with the most expensive stands giving the most protection from the elements along with the best view. Tickets for grandstands are most commonly booked in advance so the buyer can choose a specific seat, although a few may be available on entry. There may be a few grandstands at some circuits that have no seat allocation, although these don't always give the best view.\\n\\n===Traffic===\\n====By car====\\nFormula One Grands Prix are popular events, so preparations should be made for heavy traffic. If arriving by car, Fridays are often the quietest day, but don't expect to just sail through. Traffic queues on the weekend can be ridiculously long, and unless you are a dedicated soul arriving before sunrise expect to be waiting upwards of half an hour. The same can be said for leaving. A vast majority of the crowd tends to try and leave at the same time, so unless you wish to leave early (and miss some racing) or wait until late in the evening (when there is no racing going on) be prepared for more waiting. The parking areas tend to be extremely large so make a note of anything that can make identifying where you've parked easier. No one wants to be searching for their car at the end of a tiring day.\\n\\n====By shuttlebus====\\nSome circuits may offer a shuttlebus service, designed to alleviate traffic problems. Cars are parked some way from the track and shuttlebuses run at frequent times to the track in their own designated lane, so this can make entry a much quicker process.\\n\\n====By helicopter====\\nArriving by helicopter is the most stylish way for the fan to enter, if you are lucky enough to be a VIP. Most tracks have some kind of heliport, if not a purpose-built one then a field within the circuit perimeter is used. All the worries associated with queueing and waiting are largely foregone, and helicopter is surely the most stress-free way of getting in.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nWalking is generally the best option (and sometimes the only option) for getting from one area to another. Circuit maps are printed within official programs and on boards dotted around the track. If you do not have a print version of the circuit map consider taking a picture of one of the boards with your phone or camera. Bridges and service tunnels connect the interior of the circuit with the exterior.\\n\\n==Buy==\\nThere will be many stalls situated just outside the viewing areas selling all kinds of F1 and motorsport memorabilia. Stock typically includes official team/driver merchandise and clothing; pictures and paintings; branded gear such as umbrellas, binoculars and flags; DVDs and other media; and collectible racing car models. Official programs will also be on sale. Be prepared to pay high prices (remember you're mainly paying for the brand), but they can make excellent souvenirs from the event and the gear can be used again for future events. These can usually be purchased online for cheaper prior to the weekend.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\nWith these tracks often located away from city centers, hotels near many of the circuits can sell out up to a year in advance, so if you are intending on staying nearby book early. Some venues, such as Silverstone, allow camping on fields adjacent to the circuit. You will probably need to book a camping ticket to take advantage of this, and these too usually sell out fast so book early if you want to take this option.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nDespite the high visibility of the 'motorsport is dangerous' notices Formula One has quite a good spectator safety record. However, no matter how safe a restricted part of the track may seem you should not venture onto these areas as they can be quite dangerous. Previous spectator fatalities at Formula One races have been caused by the spectators in question being on a restricted part of the track. Sticking to the proper areas drastically reduces the chances of being hurt in an accident. Moving vehicles operate in the paddock areas and along service roads, so keep your eyes and ears open. If someone is hurt, there are medical tents with trained staff at various points around the track; these are marked clearly on circuit diagram boards.\\n\\nThe following general precautions should also be taken:\\n*'''Earplugs''' are highly recommended especially for young children and those going for the first time. Formula One cars are ear-damagingly loud and having 20 cars over a sustained period of 90 minutes can cause harm. Earplugs will probably be available at the track and some circuits offer basic versions for free. If you are intending on taking a radio to listen to the on-track commentary use a pair on in-ear monitors that can double as earplugs.\\n*'''[[Sun protection]]''' is advised as many races take place in the summer with only grandstand seats getting any meaningful shade. Wide-brimmed caps are handy, and sunglasses are optional.\\n*'''Waterproof clothing''' is a necessity especially for those not in sheltered areas. Even if the forecast is dry, some areas (for example Spa-Francorchamps) may experience large changes in conditions over a small area. Take a strong umbrella to cope with windy weather, otherwise bring a waterproof coat.\\n\\n{{PartOfTopic|Spectator sports}}\\n\\n{{usabletopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Motor sport WV banner.jpg}}\\n'''Motor sport''' includes car and motorcycle racing for spectators. There are motor sport events at all levels, from international series such as the [[Formula One]], to casual amateur contests.\\n\\n==Series==\\n* '''[[Dakar Rally]]''', a famous off-road race, formerly ran from Paris to Dakar, but moved to South America from 2009\\u20132019 and [[Saudi Arabia]] from 2020.\\n* '''[[Formula One]]''' (often called \\\"F1\\\") is the world's most viewed motor sport circuit.\\n* [[IndyCar]] is roughly the US equivalent to F1, racing similar open-wheel cars. However, many of its races are on oval tracks, which F1 does not use.\\n* [[MotoGP]] is equivalent to F1 for motorcycle racing. It is a series of races held on various circuits around the world, attracting top motorcycle manufacturers.\\n* [[NASCAR]] is the governing body for American stock car racing, which uses cars more similar in appearance to regular street vehicles and races almost exclusively on oval tracks. Its top-level Cup Series is the most popular form of motorsport in the US, especially in the southeastern states. Note also that one of its racing series uses pickup trucks instead of cars.\\n* The '''[[Supercars Championship]]''' takes place in Australia but also includes one race in New Zealand. It's a touring car series. Americans: think NASCAR, but run only on road courses. Europeans: think of it as an Australian equivalent to the German-based DTM series. \\n* [[World Rally Championship]]\\n\\n== Sports ==\\n\\n* '''[[Motorcycle speedway]]''' involves motorcycles racing around an oval-shaped track.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\nDespite significant improvements in safety over the past several decades, motor sports remain an inherently dangerous activity for both drivers and spectators. Strong fences surround the spectator areas at nearly every race track, but there is still a risk of car parts breaking through or even flying over the fence and causing injuries should an incident occur nearby. If one does, move away from the area immediately and follow the directions of the track's safety personnel.\\n\\nEar protection is also strongly recommended for attendees, as prolonged exposure to the very loud noise generated by racing engines can lead to hearing damage.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Air sport]]\\n\\n{{PartOfTopic|Spectator sports}}\\n{{outlinetopic}}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.8895942427096377, "reason": "The actual output correctly identifies the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza as the location for an F1 race near Milan and provides additional detail about its proximity to Milan and its role as the home of the Italian Grand Prix, which is relevant and accurate but slightly more detailed than necessary.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4o", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "______________________\n| TaskNode | Level == 0 |\n*******************************\nLabel: None\n\nInstructions:\nExtract the citation annotation of format [#] used in the answer `actual_output`, if no ciation is present return null\n\ncitation annotation:\n[2]\n \n \n__________________________________\n| BinaryJudgementNode | Level == 1 |\n************************************************\nLabel: None\n\nCriteria:\ntest whether `citation annotation` is present in the format [#] and not null\n\nVerdict: True\nReason: The citation annotation is present in the format '[#]' with a value of '[2]' which is not null.\n \n \n________________________\n| VerdictNode | Level == 2 |\n**********************************\nVerdict: True\nType: GEval\n\nCriteria:\nNone\nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check whether the facts in 'actual output' contradicts any facts in 'expected output'\",\n    \"You should also moderately penalize omission of detail\",\n    \"Vague language, or contradicting OPINIONS, are not OK\",\n    \"do not check, comment, or penalize whether 'expected output' has citations\"\n]"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "gpt-4o", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}]}, "{\"actual_output\": \"Highway 101 is the main north-south highway that takes you to San Luis Obispo, traversing the inland portions of the county and providing the fastest route for travelers [3].\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": \"0JUeu5UB2haVAWLxiKJ6\\\"\", \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"What major highway takes me to San Luis Obisbo?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"{{pagebanner|Isla Verde Banner.jpg|pgname=Carolina}}'''[http://www.gmacpr.com/ Carolina]''' is a city and municipality in [[Puerto Rico]].

They can be experienced in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n{{seealso|Astronomy}}\\n\\n[[File:Just Midnight....., Greenland - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Midnight sun in [[Greenland]]]]\\n\\nThe Earth's axis is tilted by 23 degrees in relation to the ecliptic (the plane of its orbit around the Sun) and this causes the seasons. When your part of Earth is tilted toward the Sun, you get summer; when it is tilted away, winter. For any latitude, the angle between vertical and the noon sun ranges from latitude minus tilt at the summer solstice to latitude plus tilt at the winter solstice, and is exactly the latitude on the equinoxes. In the tropics \\u2014 within 23 degrees of the equator \\u2014 that range includes 0\\u00b0 so at times the Sun is directly overhead. In Arctic or Antarctic regions \\u2014 within 23 degrees of the poles \\u2014 it includes 90\\u00b0 so at times the Sun is on or below the horizon even at noon or is above the horizon even at midnight\\n\\nThe tilt varies somewhat with time, so the figures given here are not exact. More importantly, topography and human-built structures are crucial when the sun is low. Also the refracting effect of the atmosphere is on average 0.5\\u00b0, the same as the diameter of the sun, and varies considerably in winter at high latitudes (thus especially affecting the beginning and end of polar night). In a level landscape, such as at sea, the sun seems to barely touch the horizon when it actually is just below it (with average refraction). In different tables, sunset and sunrise can be calculated according to either edge of the sun or its centre, either taking average refraction into account or ignoring it. In conclusion: don't expect the sun to rise or set exactly at times given in any source; the midnight sun is probably visible also a bit south of the Arctic Circle in Midsummer, at least as seen from a hill top without obstructions to the north (and the other way round in the southern hemisphere).\\n\\nIf you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in the winter you will experience the '''polar night''', which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon. This offers a good opportunity to see the [[Aurora borealis]], as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock. As the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars. There will probably be snow, which will magnify the light from stars, moon and auroras. In addition to the wintry lights, you will also have dawn and dusk, just no sunrise between them. Near the poles, there is twilight only in autumn and spring, and right at the poles there is in a way just one day and one night every year. The sun only rises and sets once a year \\u2014 the sun emerges around the spring equinox, takes until the summer solstice to reach its highest point and then slowly descends to disappear entirely around the autumn equinox.\\n\\nA '''white night''' is a related phenomenon. When the sun is barely below the horizon at midnight, the sky never turns dark. White nights can be experienced around the summer solstice down to 60 degrees of latitude, that of towns and cities such as [[Homer]], [[Whitehorse]], [[Qaqortoq]], [[Oslo]], [[Stockholm]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]. Places closer to the poles have a longer white night season.\\n\\n== Planning ==\\n[[File:Sommernatt i Troms\\u00f8 (7466198800).jpg|thumb|A sunny summer's night in Troms\\u00f8, Norway]]\\n\\n=== Time of the year ===\\nTo see the midnight sun, you need to be north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic circle (above 90-23=67\\u00b0 latitude) at a time close to the summer solstice, June 21 in the northern hemisphere or December 21 in the southern. To experience the polar night, you should travel there close to the winter solstice, with the dates the other way around. Going far enough to the north or south the exact date is less important; at the poles midnight sun and polar night will last about half a year each. The website [https://www.suncalc.org/#/70.4294,-151.4135,3/2022.04.21/12:09/1/3 SunCalc] can be very useful for figuring out at what time of the year to go. \\n\\n=== Time of the day ===\\nIf you want to see the sun at midnight, you clearly have to be out at midnight. Notice that your watch shows the time of your time zone, which usually is not the same as local sun time. If you want to see the sun at its lowest, it is the latter you have to observe. In [[Qaanaaq]], Greenland, that means 02:37 wall clock time (accounting for daylight saving time). North-western Alaska and some parts of Russia have a similar offset.\\n\\nFor polar night, you can enjoy the darkness most of the time. If you want to take advantage of the dawn and dusk in the middle of the day, be outdoors before first sign of dawn. For [[Northern Lights|auroras]], check the separate article.\\n\\n=== Weather ===\\nObviously you won't see the sun on a cloudy night, so it is a good idea to check the weather forecast before leaving. Also, some regions have cloud cover more often than others.\\n\\nEven in midsummer, it can be cold at high latitudes. Near-freezing temperatures are possible at nearly any of the destinations. In most regions you would travel to, temperatures are more likely to be chilly to warm, though.\\n\\nFor polar night, advice for [[cold weather]] applies to the extreme: you will be at high latitudes nearly at their coldest time. Tourist businesses may be well equipped to deal with this, but check \\u2013 and you will need proper clothes also when not being taken care of.\\n\\n== Prepare ==\\n\\n===Photography===\\n[[File:\\u041f\\u043e\\u043b\\u044f\\u0440\\u043d\\u044b\\u0439_\\u0434\\u0435\\u043d\\u044c_\\u043d\\u0430\\u0434_\\u043e\\u0437._\\u041e\\u0436\\u043e\\u0433\\u0438\\u043d\\u043e.jpg|thumb|Multiple exposure of the midnight sun on Lake Ozhogino in [[Yakutia]], Russia]]\\nSome of the most interesting photos of the midnight sun use time lapse techniques to get multiple images of the sun as it drops toward the horizon then reverses direction and begins climbing back into the sky. These require a tripod and a moderately wide-angle lens. The timing can be done manually, but it is much easier if the camera can be set to do it for you.\\n\\nSee [[travel photography]] for more general advice.\\n\\n===Ramadan===\\n[[Muslim]]s may have a problem if they are at high latitudes during the fasting month of [[Ramadan]]; the basic rule is that Muslims do not eat or drink while the sun is in the sky during that month; that would be fatal if followed rigorously in summer at high latitude.\\n\\nVarious groups of Muslim clerics allow various modified rules: use [[Mecca]] time, the  time of the nearest Muslim country or the solar time of your original home country, fast for a fixed number of hours each day, or fast in a different month since in spring or autumn the days are around 12 hours even at extreme latitude. However, some clerics insist that there can be no exceptions.\\n\\nMuslim travellers should plan ahead for this issue and consult their religious leaders if it is likely to be a problem.\\n\\n==Destinations==\\n{{mapframe|name=Destinations with midnight sun on the Northern Hemisphere|height=190}}\\n\\nBy definition, the midnight sun and the polar night can be seen in two areas:\\n* '''[[Arctic]]''' regions, including parts of the following (from west to east):\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Arctic Alaska]]|lat=68.5 | long=-151}}\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Northern Canada]]|lat=67.5 | long=-106}} (the northern parts of it)\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Greenland]]|lat=70|long=-44}} (most of it)\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Iceland]]|lat=66.4 | long=-18}} (some locations)\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Northern Norway]]|lat=70|long=23}} and {{marker|type=see|name=[[Svalbard]]|lat=78.7|long=17.4}}\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Norrbotten County|Norrbotten]]|lat=67.6 | long=20.7}} ([[Sweden]])\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Finnish Lapland]]|lat=68|long=26}} ([[Finland]])\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Murmansk Oblast]]|lat=68.1|long=34.9}} ([[Russia]])\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=north of [[Urals]], [[Siberia]] and [[Russian Far East]]|lat=70 | long=100}} (other northern parts of Russia)\\n* '''[[Antarctica]]''' (except the northern tip of the Peninsula)\\n[[File:Polar day in Naryan-Mar.jpg|thumb|right|A midnight sun in Naryan-Mar on June 21, 2017 at 23:52 local time]]\\nThe Gulf Stream warms northern Europe; the regions with white nights or midnight sun there are much more accessible than elsewhere. [[Inuvik]], one of the biggest settlement where midnight sun can be seen in Canada, has 3,000-some inhabitants, and is at the end of a 737-km mostly unpaved road. In Alaska, the main Arctic settlements [[Utqia\\u0121vik]] and [[Kotzebue]] have the same magnitude of population (counting seasonal workers in the former). On the other hand, Finnish [[Rovaniemi]] at the polar circle has more than 50,000 inhabitants and is served by daily sleeper trains. There are several cities along the Norwegian Arctic coastline, with [[Troms\\u00f8]] (80,000) having midnight sun for about 10 weeks. [[Murmansk]] (280,000), on the Kola Peninsula of Russia, is the world's largest city north of the Arctic Circle, with 2 months of midnight sun, and is served by daily trains. [[Naryan-Mar]] (21,000), the capital of [[Nenetsia]], is also in European Russia and due to relatively high standard of living among Russian cities, also suitable for viewing. Farther east, including all of Asian Russia, the Arctic is far off the beaten path, although there are some quite big cities (mostly living from mining, oil, shipping or military), with frequent flights. For example, [[Norilsk]], the greatest Asian city north of the Arctic Circle (175,000), can only be visited by citizens of Russia.\\n\\nThe Antarctic region is in the ''Screaming Sixties'' \\u2013 mostly open ocean with strong winds \\u2013 and southward. The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] is the most accessible destination at high latitude on the southern hemisphere, and the [[Esperanza Base]] just has white nights; you need to go a few hundred kilometres farther to see the midnight sun.\\n\\n== Cope ==\\nWith the sun shining all night long, it is often difficult to sleep properly. It might be a good idea to check with your hotel if there are proper thick curtains in the rooms. Be sure to bring a sleep mask.\\n\\nIn a pinch, you might be able to put together makeshift curtains by attaching aluminium foil to the inside of the window to block out the light (complicated if the windows are large).\\n\\n== Stay safe ==\\nAs always, looking at the sun is dangerous for your eyes. The sun may not look bright when near the horizon, but it is still capable of giving you blind spots.\\n\\n{{PartOfTopic|Natural attractions}}\\n{{usabletopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Tundra Banner.jpg|caption=}}\\n\\nThe '''tundra''' is a biome between the coldest parts of the [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] and the temperate climates found e.g. in [[Northern Europe]] and southern [[Canada]].

It is most famous for the October 1600 Battle of Sekigahara, but its picturesque location nestled in a small valley between mountains, combined with its complete lack of large tour buses, makes it a nice day trip from the larger nearby cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Nagoya]], and [[Kanazawa]]. The small size of the town and the well-marked paths between historic sites makes Sekigahara even more appealing, as a visitor can traverse the entire battlefield in about a day.\\n\\nYou will need a solid understanding of Japanese, or a good translator, if you wish to interact with the town on a deeper level, but English-language material is available in the museums and on historical signs by the sites.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Sekigaharascreen.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the Battle of Sekigahara]]\\n\\nSekigahara was the site of the epic '''Battle of Sekigahara''' (\\u95a2\\u30f6\\u539f\\u5408\\u6226  ''Sekigahara gassen'') between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Ishida Mitsunari, representing Toyotomi Hideyoshi's son and designated successor Toyotomi Hideyori. The Cliff's Notes version: Ishida's Western Alliance had 120,000 troops against the 75,000 of Tokugawa's Eastern Alliance, but Tokugawa cleverly exploited various grievances in Ishida's ranks to convince six ''daimyo'' (regional warlords) to defect along with some 23,000 troops, tipping the scales of the battle. A mere two hours after the battle began on the morning of October 21, 1600, the Western Alliance was in tatters and a total of some 40,000 lay dead. Ishida escaped but was captured and executed on November 6th.\\n\\nTokugawa's victory on heralded the beginning of the Edo Period, and with it the rise of the Shogunate. The destruction of most of the forces of the Western Alliance allowed Tokugawa to rapidly consolidate control of Japan within the following four months, as previously-Western or neutral daimyos either joined with Tokugawa or were crushed by him. Consequently, the town is filled with ruins, memorials and shrines to the dead. (There is a river called Kurochigawa (\\u9ed2\\u8840\\u5ddd, \\\"Black Blood River\\\"), where the Tokugawa armies washed the cut-off heads of those fallen in battle, but the name had originated in the Jinshin War in the 7th century under similar circumstances.) \\n\\nToday's Sekigahara is a rural town with a population just over 7,000. Due to its historical significance, Sekigahara is sister cities with both [[Waterloo]] in [[Belgium]] and [[Gettysburg]] in the [[United States of America|US]]. It can also be inundated with Japanese tourists (particularly schoolchildren) because of its importance in Japanese history during certain parts of the Japanese school year.\\n\\n===Tourist information===\\n* {{Listing|name=Sekigahara Tourist Information Center|alt=\\u95a2\\u30f6\\u539f\\u99c5\\u524d\\u89b3\\u5149\\u4ea4\\u6d41\\u9928 Sekigahara ekimae kank\\u014d k\\u014dry\\u016b-kan|address=598-4, Sekigahara|lat=35.363542|long=136.470854|hours=09:00-17:00, closed Tu and the day after a holiday|lastedit=2024-05-02|content=The main tourist information center in town.

The Emmy-winning [[:w:Sh\\u014dgun (2024 TV series)|2024 TV series]] based on the book is also well worth a watch.\\n\\nThe classic samurai novel ''Musashi'' by Eiji Yoshikawa ({{ISBN|156836427X}}), about the real exploits of the eponymous famous swordsman, starts where Shogun ends, with Musashi fighting on the losing side at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:Battlefield of Sekigahara viewed from Ibukiyama Drive Way.jpg|thumb|Sekigahara as viewed from Ibukiyama Driveway (looking east). The battlefield and memorials are spread across the town, in the fields, and on the mountaintops.]]\\n\\nThe JR Tokaido Shinkansen line passes through Sekigahara on its way from [[Osaka]] to [[Nagoya]], but it does not stop in the town.  If coming from [[Kyoto]] (as most Western tourists tend to do), take the Shinkansen to Maibara, and then change to the JR Tokaido Line. The Shinkansen leg takes 19 minutes and the Tokaido leg takes 21 minutes, so the trip can be done in about an hour or even quicker if you time it right with trains. Make sure to take the ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' Shinkansen, as that will stop at every station (the other Shinkansen do not stop at Maibara). Maibara is the first stop going east from Kyoto on the ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' Shinkansen. If traveling on a Seishun 18 ticket or other pass that does not permit use of the Shinkansen, take the Special Rapid (\\u65b0\\u5feb\\u901f) to Maibara and change to the JR Central portion of the Tokaido line. When using the Special Rapid train, the JR West leg takes 1 hour 7 minutes. \\n\\nIf coming from Tokyo, one of two hourly ''Hikari'' services from Tokyo stops at Maibara, and you can transfer to the Tokaido Line local for the run to Sekigahara (total time 3 hours, &yen;12,070, no charge with JR Pass).\\n\\n{{go\\n| name=Sekigahara Station | alt=\\u95a2\\u30b1\\u539f\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.36372 | long=136.46998 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2024-05-02\\n| content=is a small unstaffed rural station, with two platforms (four trains) and one entrance/exit on the south side of the tracks.

Other than that, there's nothing else in the station (no restaurants, shops, etc.).\\n}}\\n\\n=== By vehicle ===\\nDriving wise, Sekigahara is at the intersection between Routes 365 (N-S) and 21 (E-W). To the south of the town lies the E1 (Meishin) expressway that runs between [[Nagoya|Komaki]] (outside of Nagoya) and [[Nishinomiya]]. Both roads meander through narrow(ish) mountain valleys in the heart of rural Japan, and while they are in good condition (as of March 2023), they are quite far from the major tourist sites (about 1.5 hours from Kyoto and 45 minutes from Nagoya). Unless you are already staying in the [[Lake Biwa]] area or around [[Ogaki]], it's faster to buy a train ticket and take the trains.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nThere are no public buses that transport people into or through the town. The only buses that bring people in are Japanese tour coaches, so non-Japanese tourists will probably not utilize buses to visit the town at all (unless they have a really solid grasp of Japanese and have decided to book one of those tours).\\n\\n==Get around==\\n{{Mapframe|35.36641|136.46489|zoom=14}}\\n\\n=== By foot ===\\nUnless you drive in (or are bused in), everyone enters (and leaves) Sekigahara via the Sekigahara Station, which is in the center of the town. The entire town can be walked within a few hours, and it's probably well within reason to state that any part of the town is within a 20- to 30-minute walk from the Station. \\n\\nSome historic sites are located on the top of hills or small mountains. While everything is easily walked, some trails are stepped (thus bicycles are not allowed) and can be quite steep. \\n\\n=== By bicycle ===\\nBicycles can be rented at the Tourist Center opposite the Station entrance, or at the Memorial Museum to the north of the Station. Some of the more distant sites are best accessed by bicycle, but there are occasional parts of the trails where bicycles must be walked and not ridden (such as over some small dams). The bicycles use pedals that don't require snap-in shoes.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nThe town operated [http://www.town.sekigahara.gifu.jp/4588.htm Fureai Bus] rotates on 5 different routes, three times a day.

Small insects less than a centimeter long, with light organs located near their rear, they are generally unafraid of humans and can easily be 'captured', after which they will obligingly walk about on your hand for a while before flying off. Both the male and female firefly glow, but the male has two light organs and is consequently clearly brighter, while the female has only one. According to folk tradition, fireflies represent the souls of the dead, but are generally viewed in a positive light as they are thought to have the power to ward off evil.}}\\n===Battle of Sekigahara Sites===\\n[[File:Sekigahara Historial and Folklore Museum 20140206.JPG|thumb|Sekigahara Town History and Folklore Museum]]\\nWhile the ''Battle of Sekigahara'' is of major significance to Japanese history buffs and school groups, foreign visitors are rare and information in English is generally minimal. A solid grasp of Japanese and/or a local guide will come in handy here. '''Memorial posts''' (\\u9663\\u8de1 ''jin-ato'') have been set up at most major battle sites in the area, but information is in Japanese. Historic markers are set up next to the posts, which explains in Japanese and English both the significance of said post and how the battle unfolded for the person that the post commemorates (for example, the post marking Shimadzu Yoshihiro's encampment details how his forces acted in the battle).\\n* {{see\\n| name=Gifu Sekigahara Battlefield Memorial Museum | alt=\\u5c90\\u961c\\u95a2\\u30b1\\u539f\\u53e4\\u6226\\u5834\\u8a18\\u5ff5\\u9928, Gifu Sekigahara Kosenj\\u014d Kinenkan | url=https://sekigahara.pref.gifu.lg.jp/ | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.365559 | long=136.466175 | directions=just north of the Station, about a 3- to 5-minute walk up a slight hill\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\u00a5500 for adults, \\u00a5400 for students, and \\u00a5300 for kids\\n| lastedit=2023-04-04\\n| content=This new museum (built 2020) offers a good introduction to the battle itself.

The upper floors contain mainly replicas (although some original artifacts and documents are displayed) of writings relating to the battle or Tokugawa's rise to power, and then goes in depth of the aftermath of the battle and the consolidation of his rule.

More \\\"adult\\\" related souvenirs usually revolve around local ''sake'' or clothing/towels, but there are also items that will appeal to all ages.\\n* {{buy\\n| name=Sekigahara Memorial Museum Bekkan | alt=\\u5c90\\u961c\\u95a2\\u30b1\\u539f\\u53e4\\u6226\\u5834\\u8a18\\u5ff5\\u9928 \\u5225\\u9928 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.36537 | long=136.466047 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2024-09-15\\n| content=This is the museum's souvenir shop, located in a separate annex (bekkan) across from the museum.

Some of the paths (particularly the one between the Battlefield Memorial post and Okayama Signaling Hill post) go through forests where bears are present. Also, insects can be a nuisance, particularly in the forest areas and around the fields. \\n\\nSome signs are not clearly marked or have faded, and the maps mentioned in the Do section do not display every intersection.

During the postwar occupation, it was the site of the Washington Heights residence for U.S. officers. It later was selected as the site for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and the distinctive Olympic buildings designed by Kenzo Tange are still nearby. In 1967, it was made into a city park.  Today, the park is a popular hangout, especially on Sundays, when it is used as a gathering place for people to play music, practice martial arts, etc. The park has a bike path, and bicycle rentals are available.

Besides just hanging out with friends, many come here to be snapped by the magazine photographers who mingle. Unfortunately, as of lately, the police seem to be cracking down on loitering, so they are becoming increasingly rare.\\n* Over by the entrance to the park, people with greased hair listen to '''rockabilly''' music and dance in their vintage jeans. This subculture has been around since the early 1980s.\\n* The sidewalks along the south side are usually occupied by '''junk vendors''' and loud '''rock bands'''. Both of these groups periodically get swept away by police crack-downs, though.\\n* The tree-lined area leading from the south end of the park to Shibuya is filled with all sorts of '''street performers''', mostly folk-pop singers, but also including hip-hop dancing and street theater.\\n\\n===Shrines===\\n[[File:MeijiShrine_Maiden.JPG|thumb|250px|Shrine maiden at Meiji Jingu, offering a bit of serenity among all the surrounding commerce]]\\n[[File:Meiji Shrine, Barrels of sake.jpg|thumb|Meiji Shrine, barrels of sake]]\\n\\n* {{see\\n| name=Meiji Shrine | alt=\\u660e\\u6cbb\\u795e\\u5bae ''Meiji Jing\\u016b'' | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.676111 | long=139.699167 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=Free\\n| content=Tokyo's grandest Shinto shrine, built in 1920 to commemorate the late Emperor Meiji, who oversaw Japan's rapid industrialization and rise to major world power status in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The city is west of Tokyo's 23 downtown wards, bordering on [[Kanagawa]]. Machida City has relatively more nature than any other city in Tokyo. The town has been the setting for many manga and video games.\\n[[File:Buaiso stone pavement.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Buaiso]]\\n==Understand==\\nIt is the third most populous city in Tokyo. Machida is a city with a city and nature. The area in front of Machida station is busy with department stores and shopping areas, but away from the station you will find quiet residential areas, greenery and parks. Minami-Machida has been redeveloped with commercial facilities and a park at [https://gbp.minamimachida-grandberrypark.com/ Grandberry Park] (\\u30b0\\u30e9\\u30f3\\u30d9\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30d1\\u30fc\\u30af). In front of Machida, you will find a variety of shops and brands, and almost everything you need is available. Once you've done the necessary shopping, you can relax in the park.\\n\\nSatoshi Tajiri, the creator of Pok\\u00e9mon, spent his childhood in this town, and Tajiri says that his experience of playing in the nature of Machida, where he was called \\\"Dr. Insect\\\", has been used in creating Pok\\u00e9mon. A Pok\\u00e9mon manhole has been set up in Serigaya Park near the house where Tajiri lived. It is also the town where the raccoon dog (Tanuki) moves to in the last scene of the Studio Ghibli movie Pom Poko.\\n\\n===History===\\nMachida has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The oldest stone tool found in Machida City is about 23,000 years old. Around 16,500-2,800 years ago (Jomon period), people built settlements. A reproduction of a house from those days stands in the Honmachida Ruins Park (\\u672c\\u753a\\u7530\\u907a\\u8de1\\u516c\\u5712).\\n\\nThe Kamakura-kaido road runs through the city. This road network connected [[Kamakura]], the capital of the 12th century, with various places. As a stopping point for the road, a post town was established in Machida and prospered. It is said that there was a castle built in those days, but it has been replaced by a temple and a park. The Ruins of Idesawa Castle and the Ruins of Idesawa Battlefield are the Sugawara Shrine (\\u83c5\\u539f\\u795e\\u793e).\\n\\nIt also became prosperous as a transit point for the \\\"Silk Road\\\" that brought silk produced in [[Hachioji]] to [[Yokohama]] in the late 17th century. There are many old establishments with a long history. Established in 1884, Kakishimaya (\\u67ff\\u5cf6\\u5c4b), which supported \\\"Silk Road\\\" from long ago as a horse broker. Established in 1895, Masaya Shoten (\\u67fe\\u5c4b\\u5546\\u5e97), Machida's oldest dry goods store. Established in 1919, Tomisawa Shoten (\\u5bcc\\u6fa4\\u5546\\u5e97), which mainly deals in confectionery materials. Established in 1787, Oka Naozaburo Store (\\u5ca1\\u76f4\\u4e09\\u90ce\\u5546\\u5e97), a soy sauce brewer and distributor.\\n\\nDuring the war of the 20th century, Machida was spared from the fires of war, and the post-war reconstruction of the city prospered quickly. The Machida Nakamise shopping street (\\u753a\\u7530\\u4ef2\\u898b\\u4e16\\u5546\\u5e97\\u8857), which evolved from the post-war black market, retains the atmosphere of the 20th century.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n*Average spring temperatures are highs of 15-25&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 4-17&nbsp;\\u00b0C. There is a rainy season around June, when spring turns to summer.\\n*Average summer temperatures are highs of 25-33&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 20-23&nbsp;\\u00b0C, which is 1 to 2 degrees cooler than in the center of Tokyo. It's hot and humid, but the wind feels cooler than in the city center because of the many green areas. Be careful of sudden showers in summer.\\n*Average autumn temperatures are highs of 17-22&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 7-15&nbsp;\\u00b0C. There is a rainy season around September, when autumn turns to winter.\\n*Average winter temperatures are highs of 10-15&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of minus 2-5&nbsp;\\u00b0C. It can snow enough to accumulate for a day or two.\\n\\n===Tourist information site===\\nThe local tourist association has a [https://machida-guide.or.jp/ multilingual guide site].\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By train===\\nMachida is a major stop on the ''Odakyu Line'' from [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]], and the ''JR Yokohama Line'' between [[Yokohama]] and [[Hachioji]].\\n\\nNearly all Odakyu trains out of Shinjuku stop at Machida. The fastest ways to reach Machida from Shinjuku are by the Odakyu Rapid Express (\\u5feb\\u901f\\u6025\\u884c, marked with orange text) and Express trains (\\u6025\\u884c, written in red text). These trains depart frequently, every 10 minutes or less, and reach Machida from Shinjuku in about 29 to 35 minutes (\\u00a5360). Slower Semi-Express (\\u6e96\\u6025) or local trains can take about 45 to 55 minutes. Machida is also the first stop on all Limited Express services that run to Hakone. They take about the same time as a Rapid Express, but incur an additional \\u00a5400 surcharge. However, for that price you get your own comfortable seat, similar to those on a bullet train, so reserving a seat on this train especially during rush hour can make your ride a lot more pleasant.\\n\\nJR Yokohama Line trains make runs to Machida from Hachioji (20\\u201330 minutes, \\u00a5290) and Yokohama (30\\u201340 minutes, \\u00a5380). More frequent trains from Yokohama depart from nearby Higashi-Kanagawa (\\u6771\\u795e\\u5948\\u5ddd) station.\\n\\nThe Yokohama Line offers the best connection from the Tokaido Shinkansen to Machida via Shin-Yokohama station (15\\u201320 minutes, \\u00a5290).\\n\\nThere is no charge for JR trains with the '''Japan Rail Pass'''.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nKanachu and Keio bus companies jointly offer daily services to Machida from Narita and Haneda airports. (There is only one service, depending on the time of the day, you may get Kanachu or Keio service.)\\n==Get around==\\n{{Mapframe|35.542478|139.452153|zoom=12|height=400|width=400|layer=W}}\\n===By train===\\nTrains run on the Odakyu Line, the JR Yokohama Line and the Tokyu Denentoshi Line. The Odakyu Line, Tokyu Denentoshi Line and Kei\\u014d Sagamihara Line run from northeast to southwest along Kanagawa Prefecture, and the JR Yokohama Line runs from southeast to northwest along Kanagawa Prefecture. Trains run along the border of the prefecture, so buses are the main way to get around in Machida. Trains run along the border between prefectures, so buses are the main way to get around inside Machida.\\n*Odakyuu Lune (\\u5c0f\\u7530\\u6025\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Machida Station | alt=\\u753a\\u7530\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.543628 | long=139.444812 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tamagawa Gakuen Station | alt=\\u7389\\u5ddd\\u5b66\\u5712\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.563372 | long=139.463395 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tsurukawa Station | alt=\\u9db4\\u5ddd\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.583197 | long=139.481687 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n*JR Yokohama Line (JR\\u6a2a\\u6d5c\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Naruse Station | alt=\\u6210\\u702c\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.535467 | long=139.472944 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Machida Station | alt=\\u753a\\u7530\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.542003 | long=139.445369 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Kobuchi Station | alt=\\u53e4\\u6df5\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.556009 | long=139.419202 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Fuchinobe Station | alt=\\u6df5\\u91ce\\u8fba\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.568745 | long=139.395119 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Yabe Station | alt=\\u77e2\\u90e8\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.573081 | long=139.386765 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Sagamihara Station | alt=\\u76f8\\u6a21\\u539f\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.581486 | long=139.370726 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Hashimoto Station | alt=\\u6a4b\\u672c\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.594943 | long=139.344972 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Aihara Station | alt=\\u76f8\\u539f\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.606898 | long=139.331665 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n*Tokyu Denentoshi Line (\\u6771\\u6025 \\u7530\\u5712\\u90fd\\u5e02\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Minami-Machida Granberry Park | alt=\\u5357\\u753a\\u7530\\u30b0\\u30e9\\u30f3\\u30d9\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30d1\\u30fc\\u30af\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.511468 | long=139.470655 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-03\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Suzukake Dai Station | alt=\\u3059\\u305a\\u304b\\u3051\\u53f0\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.516933 | long=139.481556 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tsukushino Station | alt=\\u3064\\u304f\\u3057\\u91ce\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.527689 | long=139.485080 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n*Kei\\u014d Sagamihara Line (\\u4eac\\u738b \\u76f8\\u6a21\\u539f\\u7dda)\\n** {{go\\n| name=Tamasakai Station | alt=\\u591a\\u6469\\u5883\\u99c5 | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.601895 | long=139.367303 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-10-07\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===By bus===\\nYou can get to Machida by bus.

Centred along the Las Ramblas boulevard, it includes Barcelona's old port as well as parts built from the early Middle Ages to mid-19th century. Ciutat Vella is where the nightlife, as well as the tourist traffic in Barcelona is centred.\\n\\nIf you are looking for the famous Gaudi creations, they are not here - except for Palau G\\u00fcell - head over to [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]] and [[Barcelona/Gracia|Gracia]] to see them.\\n\\n[[File:La Rambla Barcelona 2004.JPG|thumb|right|View of Las Ramblas, Barcelona]]\\n==Understand==\\n\\nThe district is divided in four quarters:\\n\\n* '''Barceloneta''' or ''Little Barcelona'' was built after King Felipe V ordered the construction of a new fortress (La Ciutadella, nowadays a park) in order to control and punish the city of Barcelona, that fought against him during the war of Spanish Succession. The fortress was planned very close to the city so that a tenth of it was demolished, and the people who lived in this part had no compensation and as a bigger punishment were obliged to demolish their own houses.  The people from the demolished part of Barcelona had to move, so a new quarter was planned by the French military. Therefore, the streets are straight and with a square shape. There are still some houses from this period, easy to recognize because they are much lower than the others and have a simple neoclassical decoration.  Historically a fisherman's quarter, Barceloneta was traditionally a poor quarter, with dark and narrow streets, but since the 1992 Olympics significant gentrification has taken place. Most noticeably along the seafront. There are now delis serving upscale foodstuffs and high rise office buildings going up.\\n* '''Barri G\\u00f2tic''' is the oldest part of the old town.  It literally has its foundations in Roman times as it was built upon the old settlement of Barcino.  It's quite easy to see these portions of the Roman wall through this area and for those looking to see more, you can visit the City History museum which takes you below ground to tour the 2,000 year-old foundations.  Fully pedestrian, this area is quite popular for visitors to see the history of the city.  While not as active in boutique shops as La Ribera next door, it boasts its fair share of night life and shops.  Most people walk through here to view the quite stunning architecture with the ancient building leaning this way and that on their centuries-old foundations.  It is also the location of the Barcelona Cathedral which is a focal point of the city.\\n* '''La Ribera''' is a large section of the old town that encompasses everything between Arc de Triomf and Via Laietana.  It is often mistakenly called the El Born after the large, 19th-century market that sits in the area below Carrer de la Princesa.  In reality, Born is a sub neighborhood of La Ribera much like the area around the upper, Santa Catarina market.  Regardless of whether you go to the upper or lower sections, it is a very happening neighborhood with lots to do and see.  By day, there are many small shops and local designers.  By night, there is a thriving bar and restaurant scene.  It's easily reachable on foot and contains no end of old buildings, many of which date back to the 15th century.  It's easy to see the thriving, commercial past of the neighborhood with colourful names such as (in English): \\\"the street of jars\\\", \\\"the street of the silver smiths\\\", and so on.\\n* '''El Raval''' is the neighborhood of the old town just to the west of Las Ramblas.  Historically, it's had an incredibly seedy reputation, being a den of prostitution, drugs, and general crime.  This changed on a tremendous scale right before the 1992 Olympics when the city government demolished tremendous amounts of old buildings to construct new ones as well as to open up the neighborhood to more natural light given that historically, it was known to be quite dark.  This move was quite controversial as it displaced thousands of people, but for better or worse, it did change the neighborhood.  These days, it's a vibrant place for nightlife and while still very much an immigrant neighborhood, it's home to no end of bars and restaurants.  While not as historically significant as say, Barri G\\u00f2tic or La Ribera, but gradually more civic structures are sprouting in the area, such as the Filmoteca.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{Mapframe|41.379|2.181|zoom=14}}\\n{{Mapshape}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q237189}} <!-- metro -->\\n\\nSince Ciutat Vella is also the city centre, nearly all public transportation leads you there.

It was built at the final part of the 19th century in the place that formerly occupied the fortress (''ciutadella'') built after the defeat of 1714. This fortress was hated by the citizens, and when the middle age walls were demolished, so was most of the fortress. Some buildings where conserved, as such as the church, and the gunpowder magazine. The new park was used as the place to hold the 1888 international expo, and some of the older modernist buildings are there, such as the Zoology Museum, the greenhouse and, following the avenue ''Passeig de Sant Joan'' (towards the mountain), the ''Arc del Triomf'', a modernist ''Arc de Triomphe''.\\n}}\\n\\n[[File:PortVell.JPG|thumb|250px|''Rambla de Mar'' bridge in Port Vell (Old Port)]]\\n* {{see\\n| name=Port Vell | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=41.37675 | long=2.184639 | directions=walk down La Rambla until the monument to Columbus, the sea is just after it\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Port Vell | image=Port-Vell-Night.JPG | wikidata=Q1114612\\n| content=The harbor was closed to the public until the 80s and received a complete makeover before the Olympics in 1992.

A major port on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain, Barcelona has a wide variety of attractions that bring in tourists from around the globe. The many faces of Barcelona include the medieval Old Town, and the unique street grid resulting from 19th-century urban planning. The city has long sandy beaches and green parks on the hills, pretty much side-by-side. It is also famous for a number of prominent buildings, of which the most-known are by the architect Antoni Gaud\\u00ed, including his ''Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia'', which became Barcelona's symbol to many.\\n\\nFounded more than 2,000 years ago as the [[Roman empire|ancient Roman]] town ''Barcino'', Barcelona is as historic as it is modern, with a constant flow of projects changing the face of the city and long-standing penchant for design and innovation. Thanks to the wealth of attractions, a very well-developed accommodation base, a lively nightlife and a robust transportation system, Barcelona has become one of Europe's, and pretty much the world's, most popular tourist destinations.\\n\\n==Districts==\\n\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500|show=mask,go}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q941385|fill=#bdbd7b|title=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q64124|fill=#8888dc|title=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q852697|fill=#75bb75|title=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q753075|fill=#aa6baa|title=[[Barcelona/Sants-Montju\\u00efc|Sants-Montju\\u00efc]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q250935|fill=#67b7b7|title=[[Barcelona/Sant Mart\\u00ed|Sant Mart\\u00ed]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q959944, Q1765582, Q1771488, Q1641049, Q1650230 |fill=#c9815e|title=[[Barcelona/Inland Suburbs|Inland Suburbs]]}} <!-- Les Corts, Sarri\\u00e0-Sant Gervasi, Horta-Guinard\\u00f3, Nou Barris, Sant Andreu -->\\n\\n{{Mapshapes|Q237189|stroke-opacity=0.6}} <!-- metro -->\\n\\n{{Regionlist\\n| region1name=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]\\n| region1color=#bdbd7b\\n| region1description=Barcelona's old town, including the medieval Barri G\\u00f2tic, La Rambla (Les Rambles), Raval, and El Born (also known as La Ribera)\\n\\n| region2name=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]\\n| region2color=#8888dc\\n| region2description=Modernist quarter, central hub of the city, and ''the'' area to go to find Antoni Gaud\\u00ed's work.\\n\\n| region3name=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]\\n| region3color=#75bb75\\n| region3description=Formerly an independent town, it joined the city in the 20th century.

However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\\n\\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to [[Costa Daurada]], north to [[Costa Brava]] or out to sea for the [[Balearic Islands]].\\n\\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low. Given the high humidity, {{convert|19|-|23|\\u00b0C|0}} is considered comfortable weather, which is usually the temperature from May to June, and from late August to October. These are the best times to visit the city.  Anything warmer than this can feel too hot, and the period from November to April is quite chilly and at times gloomy.\\n\\n===With children===\\nToddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain. In any public place, people around you will make every effort possible to make your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them.

Fa\\u00e7ana de la Passi\\u00f3.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia church by Antoni Gaud\\u00ed is perhaps the most known landmark of Barcelona]]\\n\\nBarcelona's official languages are [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] and [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]. About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese. On the other hand, FGC announcements \\u2013 either regular or disruptions \\u2013 will be made only in Catalan, and disruption announcements on RENFE's network will usually be made only in Spanish. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a separate Romance language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.\\n\\nYou might find some locals answer in Catalan after being asked in Spanish, that's not because they are being rude but because they assume you are bilingual. In Catalonia, it's not uncommon to hear people code switching between different languages in the same conversation. In case you can't understand what they are saying, tell them you don't speak Catalan and politely ask them to repeat it in Spanish or English.\\n\\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia is a large scale immigration process from the rest of Spain, which occurred over the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language, and 40% use Catalan. The issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere.\\n\\nIn tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak English. If you are a native English speaker, you will have few problems, as Barcelona hosts many tourists.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\n[[File:Aeropuerto de Barcelona (1322744358).jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona International Airport]]\\nThe main airport is {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona El Prat|wikidata=Q56973}} ({{IATA|BCN}}). Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use the airports of ''[[Girona]]'' ({{IATA|GRO}}), nearly {{km|100}} to the north, or ''[[Reus]]'' ({{IATA|REU}}), around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair started operating at BCN, you should check carefully where your flight goes. The three-letter IATA code should be part of your booking process.\\n\\n====Barcelona International Airport====\\n{{main|Barcelona El Prat Airport}}\\n\\n[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Barcelona/en/Barcelona-El-Prat.html Barcelona International Airport] ({{IATA|BCN}}), also known as '''El Prat''', is a major transport hub, with flights from all over Europe and beyond, is by far the closest airport to the city. To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for \\u20ac5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs \\u20ac12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport) , tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (\\u20ac7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya on its way to Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya. See the Public Transport section in Get Around below for more information on tickets & passes as there were major changes in 2023.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Girona-Costa-Brava/en/Home.html Girona\\u2013Costa Brava Airport]====\\nThe Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estaci\\u00f3 del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport, synchronised with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs \\u20ac16 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac25. The journey takes approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Timetables are available [http://www.sagales.com/index.php?nIdioma=LANG3 online]. You can also take a train (you can choose between local ''Rodalies'', ''Media Distancia'' and high speed  AVE trains with different travel times and price points) to Girona main train station and a local bus from there to the airport.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Reus/en/ Reus Airport]====\\nThe easiest way is to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs \\u20ac13 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac24. The journey takes from 1 hr 30 min to 1 hr 45 min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available [http://www.igualadina.com/pdfs/REUS%20AIRPORT.pdf? online]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs \\u20ac7.25 and then the bus costs \\u20ac2.5. This takes about 2\\u00bd hours. Train timetables can be checked at Renfe's [http://www.renfe.com website] and the bus timetable is available at the [http://www.reustransport.cat/pdf/L50.pdf website]{{Dead link|date=November 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} of Reus public transport.\\n\\n[[File:Estacio Barcelona Sants - 1 - 2010-10-18 - JTCurses.jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona Sants railway station]]\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:RENFE AVE S-103 15.jpg|thumbnail|right|Superfast trains will whiz you to Barcelona from across Spain and France]]\\n\\nBarcelona is well-connected to the Spanish railway network, and to the rest of Europe. High-speed trains run frequently from main station {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona Sants|wikidata=Q800453|lat=41.37911238|long=2.139878268|url=https://www.adif.es/w/71801-barcelona-sants}} (in the southwest of the city) to Madrid, Seville and Malaga. There are also regular long-distance connections that partially use high-speed infrastructure to all major Spanish cities. The station is also served by many regional lines including {{rint|catalonia|rdc}}{{rint|catalonia|r1}}{{rint|catalonia|r2}}{{rint|catalonia|r2s}}{{rint|catalonia|r2n}}{{rint|catalonia|r3}}{{rint|catalonia|r4}}{{rint|catalonia|r11}}\\n\\nThe historic {{marker|type=go|name=Estaci\\u00f3 de Fran\\u00e7a|wikidata=Q800449}} now mostly serves regional trains.\\n\\nDirect regular [https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-europe/tgv-inoui-espagne/ high-speed train service] goes to destinations in France. In addition to two daily TGV services from [[Paris]] (travel time ~7 hr to Barcelona), there is a daily service from [[Lyon]] (5 hr), and a daily service from [[Marseille]] (4 hr). Prices start at \\u20ac39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\\n\\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerb\\u00e8re/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\\n\\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7\\u20138 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly \\u20ac30.\\n\\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called ''[http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/larga_distancia/productos/trenhotel.html Trenhotel]'' between Barcelona and Paris. ''Trenhotels'' still do, however, run between Barcelona and [[Granada]], [[A Coru\\u00f1a]] and [[Vigo]].\\n\\nThe security checks are taken seriously and may take some time.

Operation times are 05:00&ndash;24:00 (M&ndash;Th), 05:00&ndash;02:00 (F), and continuous service from Saturday at 05:00 until Sunday at midnight. Stations are marked {{rint|barcelona|metro}} on most maps; every station has a detailed map of exits to the city. Trains are fast, often coming in two minute intervals. However, on holidays and weekends trains only run every 6-8 minutes and can get easily packed. Announcements are made only in Catalan, though signs and ticketing machines generally include Spanish and English too.\\n\\n[[File:Bitllet T-10 (ATM \\u00c0rea de Barcelona).svg|thumb|right|The '''T-10 (1 zone)''' is the discontinued paper ticket. Partially replaced by T-casual]]\\n\\nPay attention to the fact that to get from metro lines operated by TMB ({{rint|barcelona|l1}}, {{rint|barcelona|l2}}, {{rint|barcelona|l3}}, {{rint|barcelona|l4}}, {{rint|barcelona|l5}}, {{rint|barcelona|l9}}/{{rint|barcelona|l10}} and {{rint|barcelona|l11}}) to the ones operated by FGC ({{rint|barcelona|l6}}, {{rint|barcelona|l7}} and {{rint|barcelona|l8}}), or vice versa, you need to exit and then enter through a new pay-gate. In this case, if you had a one-journey ticket, you need to get a new one. If you used a multiple journey ticket you won't be charged for a second time when changing lines as long as you are within the stated travel time for a single journey. Also, you can't repeat operator, so you can't use a FGC ride to make a shortcut. For instance: changing to L9S to L1 via L8 using Fira and Espanya will charge you with two journeys, you should go via Torrassa instead although its way longer. All trains are air-conditioned, but the metro stations themselves are not, so beware because the stations can become very hot during summer months.\\n\\nAlso be aware when travelling to/from the airport by Metro line L9 Sud: while the T-casual is valid for {{rint|catalonia|rdc}} {{rint|catalonia|r2n}} Renfe services (or buses), it is not accepted for the {{rint|barcelona|metro}} Metro. If you use the Metro line L9 Sud to and from the airport using a T-casual ticket, you'll be forced to pay the full fare, which is \\u20ac5.50, and the ticket you've used will not be refunded.\\n\\n====By tram====\\n\\nThere are two main sets of tram lines, Trambaix {{rint|barcelona|t1}}{{rint|barcelona|t2}}{{rint|barcelona|t3}} towards the North West of the city and Trambes\\u00f2s {{rint|barcelona|t4}}{{rint|barcelona|t5}}{{rint|barcelona|t6}} towards the East of the city near the coast. There are interchange points with other modes of transport. These lines are run by [https://www.tram.cat/en Tram] {{rint|barcelona|trambaix}} and all lines are in zone 1.\\n\\nThere is one other tramway run by TMB but is not part of the integrated ticketing system: [https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona/other-transport-tmb/tramvia-blau-tibidabo Tramvia Blau]. This is a historic tram that connects to the Tibidabo Funecular. Unfortunately in 2024 it is closed for maintenance with bus 196 available as a replacement.\\n\\n====By train====\\n\\nRegional suburban trains run through Barcelona and share ticketing with the modes of transport above. There are two operators: RENFE and FGC. Wrongly ignored by some tourists, they provide a useful additional mode of transport for getting across the city or connecting with mainline rail services and the airport.\\n\\nThe trains run by RENFE share tracks with mainline trains and are called Rodalies {{rint|catalonia|rdc}} (known in the rest of Spain as Cercan\\u00edas).

Perhaps the best option in planning your route is to consult with one of the route planners mentioned above.\\n\\nA major reorganisation of bus lines was completed in November 2018, so disregard old bus schedules and recheck routes. For example, bus line 92 to Park G\\u00fcell, used by many tourists to get there after a visit to the Sagrada Familia, has been suspended, and a new line V15 stops there but takes a different route through the city centre (Passeig de Sant Joan).\\n\\nHere are some tips for bus line codes:\\n\\n* Hxx lines run parallel to the coastline, low numbers run on the high side, high numbers on the sea side.\\n* Vxx lines run from the beach to the hills, high numbers on the northern side (Bes\\u00f2s), low numbers on the southern (Llobregat).\\n* Dxx lines run in a somewhat diagonal path, although interestingly none of these cover neither Diagonal or Meridiana avenues, the main oblique streets.\\n* Mxx lines are found at the outer perimeter of metro coverage and link a metro stop to a neighbourhood lacking metro service.\\n* Bxx lines run on the northern area outside Barcelona or linking Barcelona to neighbouring municipalities in the metropolitan area, B stands for Bes\\u00f2s river.\\n* Lxx lines run on the southern area alike Bxx lines, L stands for Llobregat river.\\n* Some municipalities have lines fully inside the town limits with two letters and a digit, theses two letters are reminiscent of the town name, such as BDx for Badalona and LHx for L'Hospitalet\\n* Nxx lines run only at night when all other lines do not run, roughly from 23:00 to 6:00.\\n* Cxx lines link Barcelona the various northern coastal Maresme towns up to [[Matar\\u00f3]].\\n* Exx lines are express buses from Barcelona to various municipalities {{km|10-60}} outside of the metropolitan area.\\n* Lines with one or two digits without any letter follow historical routes from before the H-V-D schema.\\n* Lines between 100 and 199 are usually very local lines served with low-capacity cars and poor frequency, 30 min or worse. Notable cases are line 111 to the Tibidabo amusement park, line 120 through Ciutat Vella, and line 150 to Olympic venues and the Montju\\u00efc castle; others are mostly useless for tourists.\\n* Line numbers from 200 upwards are used for some routes going outside the metropolitan area, while some others of the same kind have no number at all.\\n\\nBuses H-V-D run about every 6\\u201312 min weekdays, 15\\u201320 min weekends. \\n\\nNitbus (N) run every 20 min all night.

It takes little over an hour to walk from Port Vell at the seaside to Park G\\u00fcell at the foothills of the mountain range at the northeastern end of the city, and you can see a range of attractions, including La Rambla and Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia, on your way. There are opportunities all around to sit down and enjoy a drink or a meal everywhere. If you are fit, you can pretty much explore the city by foot alone, unless the heat beats you in the warmer months (and then you can always resort to the air-conditioned metro).\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (\\u20ac3/hour, \\u20ac20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\\n\\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, ''Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes'' is actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\\n\\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\\n* Near ''Moll de Sant Bertran'' (which is south-west from ''Museu Maritim'') - driving at B\\u201310, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\\n* Somewhere near Guell Park.\\n* Near Font M\\u00e0gica, in Pla\\u00e7a Espanya and the Montju\\u00efc hill.\\n\\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.\\n\\n=== By taxi ===\\nAs of January 2019, [[Ride-sharing and carsharing services|ride-sharing services]] such as Uber require at least one hour's notice. For less than one hour's notice, you need to call a regular taxi.\\n\\n==See==\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500}}\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n{{infobox|What to see in the dark|The most spectacular sights in the night are:\\n* ''Musical fountains'', in Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.

Small corner stores are the most visible on city streets, but tend to mark up prices in exchange for convenience.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nAs with all cities which welcome large numbers of tourists, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, but there are plenty of restaurants serving excellent food at very reasonable prices, if you know where to look. The usual rules of thumb apply: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track used by fellow travellers, and seek out caf\\u00e9s and restaurants which the locals frequent. In practice, this usually involves searching out eateries in residential districts away from the main sightseeing attractions. Avoid restaurants with touts outside, and have a basic understanding of the traditional foods served in restaurants, as well as the local drinks. One slightly crafty way of sussing a place's authenticity at a glance is to take note of how they spell a certain word: a menu board advertising ''tap'''a'''s'', written the Spanish/international way, is likely to be somewhere which primarily caters to tourists, whereas somewhere offering ''tap'''e'''s'', using Catalan spelling, is in all probability a venue frequented by locals.\\n\\nSome districts to check out include [[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]], which is a hub of quality, affordable Catalan cooking of both the traditional and more avant-garde varieties, and the [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]], whose chic boulevards have upscale restaurants aplenty worthy of your splurge money. The fishing quarter of Barceloneta (in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]) is an example of a neighbourhood where it pays to be picky: closer to the gentrified seafront, a slew of mojito beach bar-style places serve up expensive tourist tapas; for the real thing, head into the backstreets, where many traditional bars are still tucked away. In all cases, be prepared to \\\"promenade\\\" in search of the most attractive-looking menu; that's what the locals do, after all.\\n\\n{{infobox|Where to eat during siesta|The majority of restaurants and cafes are closed 16:00-20:00 for ''migdiada''. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:\\n* tapas in bars\\n* international chains\\n* food stands in market halls}}\\n\\n'''Set menus (men\\u00fa del migdia / men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda)''' Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a ''men\\u00fa del migdia'' / ''men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' (menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for \\u20ac12 to \\u20ac20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 14:00 to 16:00. The savvy traveller will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve ''platos combinados'', which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.\\n\\n'''Smoking''' is not permitted inside bars and restaurants since 2011, but it's usually allowed in terraces.\\n\\n===Dishes===\\n[[File:Tapas Barcelona.jpg|thumb|250px|A plate of ''tapes'']]\\n\\nYou can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.\\n\\n''See [[Catalonia#Catalan Cuisine|Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article]].''\\n\\nThe selection of '''seafood''' is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).\\n\\nA treat to try that no travel guide mentions is '''waffles''' sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\\n\\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\\n\\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of '''durum''' or '''shawarma''' stands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around \\u20ac5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the '''Asian''' selection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants, while '''Latin American''' offerings, particularly Argentine and [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], are well-represented too.\\n\\n===Food tours===\\n\\nIf you feel lost in the variety of food choices there are \\u2013 Catalan, Basque, Spanish, and beyond \\u2013 it may be helpful to do a food tour to quickly get oriented.

As much a show as it is a place to get a drink, it's a fun night out.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n[[File:Hotel Vela (8698052023).jpg|thumbnail|right|The sail-shaped hotel W Barcelona is one of the city's newest landmarks]]\\n\\nBarcelona offers a great range of accommodations, from cheap, decent apartments, hostels and guest-houses to five-star hotels. Every district has plentiful offerings, and thanks to the efficient public transportation you can stay comfortably in any of them, depending on your budget and preferences.\\n\\nDuring festivals (see [[#Festivals and events|Festivals and events]] above), especially during [http://www.mobileworldcongress.com Mobile World Congress], which is a major trade show at the Fira, accommodation in Barcelona and especially near the Fira is much more difficult to find and more expensive than usual.\\n\\n* [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella#Sleep|Ciutat Vella]] offers a mix of luxury hotels and cheerful hostels within a dense urban environment.

Wi-Fi is widely available in public places and on transport.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Pickpockets===\\n\\n[[Pickpockets|Pickpocketing]] is the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona. '''Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents''' in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\\n\\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\\n* At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\\n* A milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\\n* East Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \\\"martial arts\\\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\\n* These people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\\n* Male travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\\n* In the '''subway''', a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance ''and'' exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\\n* Under no circumstances should you '''leave your items''' unattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\\n\\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can [https://denuncies.dgp.interior.gencat.cat/denuncies/ file a report online] if you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices.\\n\\n===Scams===\\n{{Seealso|Common scams}}\\n\\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\\n\\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of [[common scams#Overcharging|methods]] are employed, including the [[common scams#No-change_trick|No-change trick]]. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.\\n\\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\\n\\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\\n\\nA version of [[common scams#Three Card Monte|Three Card Monte]] is one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\\n\\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you.\\n\\n===Violent crimes===\\n\\nIn 2019 there was a surge in violent crimes around Barcelona: in just the summer, there were almost as many violent deaths as there were for the whole previous year. While tourists are only occasionally targeted (and almost exclusively simple robberies), this should be not a going concern, many of these deaths are either drug-related or take place during drunken fights, so you are best advised to avoid such situations.\\n\\n===Football===\\nLocal club '''FC Barcelona''' (also known as \\\"Bar\\u00e7a\\\", a term used by locals to refer strictly to the club and not the city) is seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and has a very heated and politically-charged rivalry with Real Madrid, which is seen as a symbol of the Spanish state and ruling establishment, and violent confrontations between the supporters of both clubs have been known to occur. Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\\n\\nFurthermore, the local ''Derbi barcelon\\u00ed'' between FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain. If you hear Bar\\u00e7a and Espanyol fans having an argument, be careful, as things can quickly escalate.\\n\\n===ATMs===\\nBarcelona offers ATMs in many locations. Many provide a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.), and most accept ATM/debit/credit cards of various banks. Choose an ATM in a secure or highly-public space (e.g., in a bank lobby or airport terminal) to avoid machines modified by criminals to skim/video your card data or where you might be robbed after use.  Ensure early in usage that the ATM supports a language you understand. For a full discussion of safe/effective charge/debit/ATM card usage and their cost trade-offs, see also [[Money]]. They will charge you a usage fee on top of anything your bank charges you which should be declared on the screen before you proceed (2,90\\u20ac for a 500\\u20ac withdrawal as of Oct. 2024 across different banks).\\n\\n===Areas of caution===\\n\\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (''cercanias'' in Spanish or ''rodalies'' in Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\\n\\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montju\\u00efc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\\n\\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\\n\\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\\n\\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\\n\\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\\n\\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.\\n\\n===Anti-tourism movement===\\n\\nMany Barcelona residents have the impression that there are too many tourists in Barcelona and that it has increased living costs, as landlords prefer to rent to tourists and not to locals to make more profit. Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024.\\n\\n===Cars===\\n\\nTourist drivers may attract special attention, such as [[common scams#Red light bag snatch|Red light bag snatch]] or [[common scams#Flat tire|Flat tire scams]]\\n\\n===Public transportation===\\n\\nBesides being a particular pickpocket hot spot, there are plenty of fare evaders who will stick to you when crossing a fare barrier. Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean ''carte blanche'' for them. The fare evasion fine is just \\u20ac50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome.\\n\\n===Reporting crimes===\\n\\nIf you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers generally do not speak English, even though the theft report form is in English, Spanish, and Catalan. The police station most often used to report theft is the one underneath Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya beside metro station, where they have some translators for common languages.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n===Hospitals===\\nEU citizens can get free or reduced cost medical treatment on presentation of an EHIC card and passport.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Hospital Clinic I Provincial De Barcelona | url= | email=\\n| address=C/ Villarroel 170 | lat= | long= | directions=Metro Stn Hospital Clinic (Line 5)\\n| phone=+34 932 275 400 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===Consulates===\\n\\n{|\\n|-\\n| style=\\\"vertical-align:top;width:50%;\\\" |\\n* {{flag|Angola}} {{listing\\n| name=Angola | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer del Consell de Cent, 413-415 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 245 02 73 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Argentina}} {{listing\\n| name=Argentina | url=http://cbarc.mrecic.gov.ar/en | email=\\n| address=Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia, 11 (08007) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 304 12 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Australia}} {{listing\\n| name=Australia | url=http://spain.embassy.gov.au/madr/home.html | email=ausconbcn@gmail.com\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 433 Bis, Second Floor, Door 1 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 362 3792 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Austria}} {{listing\\n| name=Austria | url= | email=barcelona@consuladodeaustria.com\\n| address=Carrer de Mari\\u00e0 Cub\\u00ed, 7 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 368 60 03 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bangladesh}} {{listing\\n| name=Bangladesh | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Londres, 35 (08029) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 410 83 89 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belgium}} {{listing\\n| name=Belgium |alt=| url=http://www.diplomatie.be/barcelonafr/default.asp?id=31&mnu=31 | email=barcelona@diplobel.fed.be\\n| address=Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 680 (08010) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 80 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n|wikidata=|lastedit=2020-08-05| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belize}} {{listing\\n| name=Belize | url= | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 469 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 430 30 44 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Benin}} {{listing\\n| name=Benin | url=http://www.consuladobenin.com/ | email=consuladobenein@terra.es\\n| address=Carrer d'Arag\\u00f3, 290 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bolivia}} {{listing\\n| name=Bolivia | url=http://consuladodeboliviaenbarcelona.es/ | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Roger de Flor, 3 (08018) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 322 65 12 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Brazil}} {{listing\\n| name=Brazil | url=http://www.brasilbcn.org/ | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 468 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 488 22 88 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bulgaria}} {{listing\\n| name=Bulgaria | alt= | url=https://www.mfa.bg/es/embassies/spain-barcelona | email=Consulate.Barcelona@mfa.bg\\n| address=Avinguda de la Riera de Cassoles, 54 (08012) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 937 969 950 | tollfree= | fax=+34 937 969 949\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Burkina Faso}} {{listing\\n| name=Burkina Faso | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Muntaner, 261 (08021) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 93 200 99 09 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Canada}} {{listing\\n| name=Canada | url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/spain-espagne/offices-bureaux/consul_barcelona.aspx | email=bclna@internacional.gc.ca\\n| address=Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, 9 (08002) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 412 72 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|France}} {{listing\\n| name=France | url=http://www.consulfrance-barcelone.org/ | email=info@consulfrance-barcelone.org\\n| address=Ronda Universitat 22 bis -

The area was originally meant to be a residential property development with Gaudi doing much of the planning and landscape design. Only two houses were built and the land was later sold to the city of Barcelona and turned into a park. There are two areas -- a relatively undeveloped (and un-crowded) natural area near the top of the hill and the more famous sculpture park below. The top of the park offers panoramic views of Barcelona, while the sculpture portion is full of walkways and other structures exhibiting the distinct and colourful style of Gaudi, including the famous terrace and fountains near the main entrance. You are strongly advised to buy tickets days in advance. Don't expect to be able to buy one on the day. Be patient when exploring the site, as once you enter the Natural Plaza where crowds gather, you are confined to a one-way path that you must traverse before backtracking if you want to return to higher ground. Park G\\u00fcell is listed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] as one of the Works of Antonio Gaudi. }}\\n\\nPopular sights and attractions within the park include:\\n\\n* {{see\\n| name=Park G\\u00fcell, the main entrance | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=41.4135 | long=2.1532 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Two Gaudi-style pavilions mark the entrance to the park and lead to the steps up to the Hipostila Room.

Built by Gustave Eiffel in 1887-1889, the tower was almost torn down in 1909 and only saved due to its use as a telegraphy antenna. The queues can be very long. The tower allows online reservations at its website. You can select a date and time frame. If you miss the time on your ticket, you have lost your money. The north, west, and east pillars have elevators that go to the first and second floors; the south pillar has stairs that can be climbed to the second floor. To reach the top floor, an additional elevator ride is required, and the wait for this can be very long as well. Disabled visitors are not allowed beyond the second floor due to safety concerns. Taking the M\\u00e9tro as far as Ecole Militiare and then strolling up the Champ de Mars is a lovely way to arrive at the tower.

It has a connection with Leonardo Da Vinci, who lived and worked for some time in the nearby town of Vaprio d'Adda. An open air museum (Ecomuseo Adda di Leonardo) celebrates the Italian genius and his works along the Adda river.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\nPaderno d'Adda is not far from [[Milan]], making it a good choice for a day trip. Be careful to not confuse Paderno ''d'Adda'' with [[Paderno Dugnano]], these are two different towns.\\n\\n===By train===\\n\\nThe Paderno d'Adda/Robbiate train station is 1km/0.6mi from the bridge and the river. Regular trains run from Milano Porta Garibaldi station (direction Bergamo via Carnate). \\n\\n===By car===\\nTake the A51 (tangenziale est) motorway northward up to Agrate, then continue toward Lecco. The road is a high speed freeway up to Carnate, then turns into a regular road. When you reach Cernusco Lombardone turn to the right and you will reach the San Michele Bridge in Paderno d'Adda.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\nThe village is quite small and the river bank is only accessible by foot or by bike.\\n\\nThere are no signs in the village, so take a map with you.\\n\\n==See==\\n[[File:Ponteferropadernodadda.jpg|thumbnail|right|San Michele Bridge from the river bank]]\\n\\n{{see|name=The San Michele Bridge| content=The '''San Michele Bridge''' (locally known simply as the ''Paderno Bridge'') is more than 100 years old, since it was built in 1889 to cross the Adda river. The iron bridge is 85mt high and 266mt long, and Its structure resembles closely the [[Eiffel Tower]]. <br />It has a double-deck structure, with the upper deck reserved to vehicular traffic and the lower deck used by the Milano-Bergamo train line. The bridge is still opened to vehicles, with a traffic light regulating the traffic (only one way by turns). Be aware that, due to the advanced age of the structure, heavier vehicles are forbidden to cross the bridge.<br />The train crosses the bridge between Paderno d'Adda and Calusco stations. While Paderno station is near the bridge, Calusco is quite far away.|lat = 45.68221|long = 9.45218}}\\n\\n==Do==\\nFrom San Michele Bridge, you can reach the '''Adda river bank'''. At the left of the bridge you will see a little chapel, here departs the road which leads to the river bank. Pay attention to the difference in height: the river lies 85mt below the bridge level and there is a steep road to climb when you return.\\n\\nThe river bank is reserved to pedestrian and cyclists. Expect a lot of people during sunny week-ends, since this is favourite place for locals to go walking, biking and jogging. Pay attention to little children, especially if you ride a bike.\\n\\nThe river bank is a great spot for photographers and can also be a quiet and peaceful place (when it's not packed with people). \\n\\n===Northward===\\nTurn left and walk northward (leave the river at your right).\\n\\n* {{do\\n| name= Imbersago and Leonardo's ferry boat | lat=45.70787 | long=9.45620\\n| lastedit=2015-04-14\\n| content= you can reach Imbersago and its ferry boat. It's a 40 minutes long walk, on a flat path. During the trip you can enjoy the quiet river bank and spot many birds and little animals.<br />In Imbersago you can see Leonardo's ferry boat. The ferry boat has no engine, it crosses the river using solely the river flow force. Leonardo wrote down some notes about this kind of boat, although it's not certain if he designed it or he just observed some of these boats already active during the time he spent here. Leonardo's notes and drawings about the ferry are contained in the Windsor Codex and copies are on display at the ferry's embarcadero.<br />In the past up to five of these boats crossed the river at various locations. Nowadays this is the only ferry left using the moving principle drawn by Leonardo. It operates daily and it can carry persons, bikes and even one or two cars, but there is not much to see on the other bank. The service may be suspended if the water level is too low.\\n}}\\n\\n===Southward===\\n\\nTurn right and walk southward (leave the river at your left) you can pass under the San Michele Bridge and continue along the river bank.\\n\\n*{{do\\n| name= Naviglio di Paderno\\n|lat=45.6801 | long=9.4566\\n| lastedit=2015-04-14\\n| content=Naviglio di Paderno is an artificial channel built to overcome the rapids on this part of the river and make the navigation between Milan (via the Martesana channel) and Como lake possible.

Pay attention to not push yourself too far, remember that you have to go back and there are no easy transportation systems to rely upon. Be also aware that the path climbs down on this direction, always remember that you have to go back.\\n\\n==== Safety ====\\nWatch your step: some parts of the path are unprotected and a plunge in the river is a rather unpleasant experience.

This is especially aggravated during shift changes at the local automotive plants. But due to economic hardships for the region, rush hour traffic lasts less than an hour, and some freeways are clear all day. The Mixing Bowl, I-75/696 interchange, the I-94/Ford Freeway through Detroit, and the Southfield Freeway can be slow in late afternoons.

Mile roads run east-west, starting at downtown Detroit and increasing as you travel north. These mile roads may change name in different cities, so pay attention. There are also several spoke roads, including Woodward Ave, Michigan Ave, Gratiot Ave, and Grand River Ave. Only in the old downtown business district is the original Washington D.C./L'Enfant-style wheel and spoke layout found (it is quite confusing, with several one-way streets added for fun).

Six major spoke roads radiate out from downtown; they are, in clockwise order, Fort Street, Michigan Avenue, Grand River Avenue, Woodward Avenue, Gratiot Avenue, and Jefferson Avenue. Woodward Avenue runs northwest-southeast (more or less) and divides the northern half of Detroit into east and west; West Warren Street, for instance, becomes East Warren Street when it crosses Woodward. Smaller streets generally conform to a strict grid pattern, but the orientation of the grid and the size and shape of blocks frequently varies to fit better with the spoke roads.

Detroit's history of streetcars began in 1863 with horse cars and eventually grew into a complex and comprehensive system. However, streetcar service eventually ended in 1956; the QLine opened 61 years later and is hoped to be the first of many new tram lines.}}\\n\\nThe line has 12 stations (four downtown, five in Midtown, and three in New Center/North End), each covered with seating and free Wi-Fi. It connects with the People Mover at Grand Circus Park and with Amtrak at the Amtrak Station. It operates M-Th 6AM-11PM, F 6AM-midnight, Sa 8AM-midnight, Su 8AM-8PM. Walk-up fare (valid for three hours) is $1.50, a day pass is $3, and a monthly pass is $30.

A daily pass is $8 and includes unlimited 30-minute trips. There are also monthly and annual passes.\\n\\nDetroit is one of the best cities for biking. Due to the surge and collapse of the auto industry, most streets have multiple lanes in each direction. Because of sharp population declines, there are rarely enough cars to fill all these lanes, therefore bikers can usually have a lane to themselves, a rare occurrence in most cities. Detroit is home to many budding bike co-ops, the most active is the Hub of Detroit, and its sister program Back-Alley Bikes. Both are in the Cass corridor, on Cass Ave. and Martin Luther King Ave. Back-Alley Bikes has weekly volunteer nights, and monthly women and transgender bike workshops.\\n\\nThe Detroit Critical Mass held on the last Friday of every month is well attended.

Thankfully this has started to change somewhat with a few local independently owned supermarkets opening up and the opening of a Whole Foods Market in Midtown, two Aldi stores, and two Meijer stores means that Detroit no longer has the dubious distinction of being the largest city in the US without a chain grocery store. The major drug store chains such as CVS and Walgreens in addition to convenience stores such as 7-11 however do have a few locations scattered throughout the city.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n[[File:DetroitGreektownS.jpg|thumb|250px|Greektown]]\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n\\nDetroit is home to many American classics including Sanders Hot Fudge, Little Caesars Pizza, Better Made Potato Chips, and Vernor's Ginger Ale. (Vernor's Ginger Ale shares the distinction as America's oldest soft drink with Hires Root Beer.)\\n\\nDetroit is famous for the ubiquitous Coney Island. The term refers to a hot dog with chili, mustard, and chopped fresh onions; the name also applies to restaurants that serve them. The two oldest are American Coney Island and Lafayette Coney Island, next door to each other in downtown Detroit. Coney Islands can be found all over the city. People in the suburbs get their fill from local chains such as National Coney Island and Leo's Coney Island.\\n\\nDetroit-style pizza is a delicious and crispy deep-dish pizza that you can't really find outside Michigan (with some exceptions). Not quite as thick as Chicago-style pizza, the buttery crust is worth seeking out. The Detroit classic is Buddy's Pizza, with locations throughout the metro Detroit area. Loui's Pizza in Hazel Park makes a fine example, as well. The dozens of Jets Pizzas in the area do it right and do it quickly.\\n\\nExplore Detroit's Greektown, with its Greek restaurants and shops surrounding the Greektown Casino. Detroit's Mexicantown is known for Mexican cuisine at restaurants such as Mexican Village, Evie's Tamales, El Zocalo and Xochimilco. Restaurants, bakeries, and shops are on Vernor Highway, on both the east and west sides of the Interstate 75 service drive. Hamtramck is famous for its Polish cuisine and bakeries. Choose to dine in elegance at one of Detroit's many fine restaurants a sample of which include the Coach Insignia atop the Renaissance Center Downtown, the Whitney House restaurant in Midtown, or the Opus One in the New Center.\\n\\n==Drink==\\nVernor's Ginger Ale, created by Detroit pharmacist James Vernor, shares the distinction as America's oldest soft drink with Hires Root Beer. A local favorite, Detroiters pour Vernor's over ice cream (this drink is called a \\\"Boston Cooler\\\" in reference to Boston Blvd. in Detroit, not the city in Massachusetts). Also try Faygo soft drinks, another former Detroit based soft drink company. Detroiters enjoy [http://www.michiganwines.com Michigan Wines]. A family of GM heritage, the Fisher family Coach Wines are served at the Coach Insignia Restaurant atop the GM Renaissance Center.

The overall crime rate in downtown Detroit is below the national average, and crime has declined significantly, but the city is still among the most dangerous in the country. That being said, if you exercise common sense and don't go looking for trouble, you'll be fine.\\n\\nDowntown Detroit is generally well-policed and the safest part of the city. Crimes sometimes occur, but exercising common sense will go a long way toward keeping you and your valuables safe.\\n\\nStick to major freeways when possible and try to avoid smaller streets through unfamiliar neighborhoods. How you carry yourself can easily keep you from getting mugged.\\n\\nSporting events, festivals and other large public events are always heavily policed and very safe. Sporadic crime events, mostly alcohol-related and involving groups of youths, have been reported at some of these events but they are by far the exception.\\n\\nSome of the hard-core night club music scene is between downtown venues like the Majestic Theater/Magic Stick complex, places in Hamtramck, and suburban venues in places like Royal Oak. Unless you take a taxi, you will have to drive, navigate the city at night, and typically park on the street. Patrons at some venues, such as Harpo's on the east side, should take safety precautions.\\n\\nAlways use caution and ask around before going to a particular venue. People at record stores, guitar shops, \\\"cool\\\" clothing stores, and the like often visit and know which venues are easy to get to and reasonably safe.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\nDetroit has a modern freeway system that is easy to navigate, but suburban Detroit drivers tend to drive fast and aggressively. The flow of traffic on a freeway is routinely 10 mi over the speed limit, and weaving in and out of lanes is standard practice, often times without signaling. If you are driving the posted speed limit in the fast lane, the driver behind you may have no qualms about tailgating you, so if you plan on driving slowly, stay in the far-right lane. If you like to drive slowly and cautiously you may find yourself getting honked at, yelled at, given the finger, tailgated, etc.\\n\\nDetroit Metropolitan Airport has an attached Westin Hotel and conference center. The airport is among the most modern in the United States with both international and domestic gates in the World Terminal. Galegroup's Hour Media LLC publishes a full color guest guide found in hotels in the metro Detroit area. Visitors may request a guest packet from the Detroit Convention and Visitors Bureau. The Convention and Visitors Bureau sponsors Discover Detroit TV which airs Mondays at 5:30PM on Detroit Public Television. The city has ample parking garages, valet, and pay-to-park lots near major attractions. Laurel Park Place Mall in Livonia has an attached Marriott Hotel.

These are designed to get your money or business from you under false pretenses. They fall into three categories: overcharging you, deceiving you or coercing you into paying for a service you don't want, and outright [[theft]].\\n\\nA scam is not necessarily a [[crime]], and police might not have the will or legal ability to help out victims. In the worst case they may even be in on it and some ways of local law enforcement may indeed work with various forms of entrapment or trickery that might fall into a moral category not all that unlike some scams on this list.\\n\\nPrevention is based on knowledge: researching your destination will both alert you in advance to scams in the area and let you know what the usual prices and truly good sights are so you will be less reliant on the approaches of helpful individuals when you're vulnerable.\\n\\nAt the same time, if you do get stung, don't be too hard on yourself: you were dealing with people who knew the location a lot better than you and with people who were out to deceive you.  In some cases, you were dealing with hardened criminals. If you think what happened to you was illegal and the police are trustworthy, report it; otherwise, just chalk it up to experience. If you wish to make a theft-related claim against an [[travel insurance|insurance]] policy, you will generally need to make a police report within 24 hours and keep a copy for your insurance company. You will also need a police report to replace some stolen identity documents, such as [[passports]].\\n\\nThe US State Department has a [https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html page] warning of scams practised on travellers.\\n\\n== Avoiding scams ==\\n{{quote|Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.|author=English proverb}}\\n\\n===Preparation===\\n[[File:Koh Tao Arrivals 2.jpg|thumb|Being an obvious tourist can make you a target for scammers]]\\n* Keep in mind that when you meet someone new, you never know who they really are or what their intentions are until you dig a little deeper into them (and sometimes not even then). \\n* If you have travelling companions, keep each other informed of the general outlines of your plans for the day. Buy an inexpensive SIM card or burner phone for each person so that people in your party can contact each other if they get separated.\\n* Don't carry unnecessary amounts of cash, jewelry, or luxury items around with you. If you have an expensive smartphone, conceal it when you are not using it.\\n* In high-risk areas, don't draw attention to the fact that you are non-local. Travel light, don't carry a camera around your neck, and dress as the locals do. Avoid typical \\\"tourist\\\" accessories, such as maps or backpacks. A vehicle with number plates from another country, or with a prominent rental car firm logo, may be targeted for break-in or theft.\\n* Don't print your name on the outside of your bags; use an opaque luggage tag. Someone may read your name off of your bag and pretend to know you.\\n* [[Alcoholic beverages|Alcohol]] and other drugs affect your judgment and should be indulged in only among people you have good reason to trust.\\n* Research into your destination, its general layout, and the usual price ranges are helpful in avoiding many scams. When [[arriving in a new city]], have a plan of where to go and be aware that airports, railway stations and the like are often places where touts and con men wait for newcomers they can offer their \\\"help\\\" to.\\n* Knowing where you want to go and what you want to do and then sticking to that plan is a good way to avoid getting ripped off.\\n* Knowing the language \\u2014 even just basics \\u2014 will make you look less \\\"foreign\\\" and be helpful in getting the help of locals when you're the victim of some malfeasance.\\n\\n===Warning signs===\\n* Each country has different high-crime areas. In general, low-income areas, touristed areas, stations for rail and other public transport and nightlife districts have higher crime risk than other areas. While airports themselves are often safe enough, the surrounding community may be dodgy; it's also likely to be far from the heart of the city. Many destinations have a [[motel]] strip on what used to be the main road into town; as these roads are bypassed by motorways, the lodgings (or even the local area) may go into decline or become a crime magnet. As each community is different, check the \\\"stay safe\\\" section of the Wikivoyage city article before deciding where to stay.\\n* Remember that astounding deals and amazing winnings are as unlikely as they seem and likely to be part of a scam.\\n* Be wary of any stranger who seems to be singling you out for extended special attention, especially if they are trying to persuade you to leave your friends or accompany them to an unknown area.\\n* Avoid anyone [[begging]], particularly if they're using children to beg on their behalf (a common scam). In China, if you see a child begging, please post a picture of them online,<!-- where? --> as those children are often victims of kidnapping, and posting a picture online can make it easier for the children to be located. \\n* Being in any situation where you are among a group of strangers who all know one another, but who don't know you, provides them a great deal of power over you.\\n* When sending money to people or businesses you don't know, use '''repudiable''' payment methods such as credit cards. If a stranger insists on a '''non-repudiable''' method, such as cash or a wire transfer, you should be suspicious. A repudiable payment can be cancelled or refunded in case of fraud.\\n* Be wary of attractive-looking strangers trying to raise your sexual emotions, including sex workers, touts and hospitality staff.\\n\\n===Reaction===\\n* Always discuss and agree a price before you accept any products, services, or accommodation, and always have some proof of payment.\\n* You are not required to be polite or friendly to anyone who refuses to leave you alone when you request it.\\n* Nor are you required to answer getting-to-know-you questions from random people. These may just be friendly locals, but they might also be scammers looking for information useful to them.\\n* Walking on when offered some \\\"incredible deal\\\" might seem rude but really is par for the course and many locals have it down pat. Try to learn from them.\\n\\n== \\\"Helpful\\\" locals ==\\n\\nThese scams are based upon the idea of offering you help or advice that is actually deceptive, trusting that you will rely on the scammer's \\\"local knowledge\\\". They usually involve giving advice that results in you paying for something that you otherwise wouldn't or going somewhere you don't want to go. Some scams in which a helpful local offers to cut you a good deal can be outright fraudulent, such as convincing you to buy fake gems, but many simply get you to pay for something that you wouldn't pay for if you knew the area better, or to pay too much.\\n\\nOne of the biggest traps of these kinds of scams is the desire to be polite to people who are polite and friendly to you; and the scammers know this. While you shouldn't become a hard-nosed nasty person, you should receive unsolicited offers of help with polite caution, and if somebody insists on giving help you don't want, there's no need to stay polite in fending it off: feel free to walk away or speak firmly at the person. Yelling for help could be necessary, but reserve that for situations where you feel threatened; otherwise it will often just attract more unwanted attention. Pretending they don't exist, which entails not making eye contact, not walking faster, not saying 'hello' or 'no', will often humiliate them or tire them out without frustration on your part. Do not respond if they call you racist to attract your attention. If you said \\\"no thank you\\\", don't let them use that as having their foot in the door in engaging in a conversation with you.\\n\\nAnother trap is the \\\"too good to be true\\\" offers: they are almost certainly not true.\\n\\n=== Accommodation recommendations ===\\n[[File:Donttout.jpg|thumb|''Warning! Rooms cost more if a tout takes you.'']]\\n\\nYour driver or guide will tell you that the place you're heading to is closed, no good or too expensive and that he knows somewhere better. While this may be true, it's likely that the 'better' place is giving him a commission for referrals, and his commission is just going to increase your room rate.\\n\\nYou must insist on going to your planned destination. In some cases the driver will not drive you to your hotel even if you insist. In some places, taxi drivers will take you to the wrong hotel and insist it is the one you requested! Get the correct name because there are a lot of copies and similarities in their names.\\n\\nTo avoid being held hostage by a mercenary taxi, keep your luggage with you on the back seat so you can credibly threaten to walk out and not pay.  They'll usually back down by the time you start opening the door\\u2014and if they don't, get a new driver.\\n\\nOne option for avoiding potential hassle is to arrange for your hotel to pick you up at the airport or train station.\\n\\nBefore [[Arriving in a new city|arriving in a new location]], have your accommodation pre-booked, find out where it is on the map and see if there are alternatives to hailing taxis, such as public transport.  If you're willing to pay a bit extra, many airports and train stations have dedicated taxis or limousine transfer services, or you can arrange a pickup directly with your hotel.  If you do need to book accommodation after arrival, book from a reputable source such as a local travel agency or tourism office and get their recommendation on how to best get there, or do your own research.\\n\\n=== Attraction closed ===\\n\\nYou may arrive at a major tourist destination only to find a very helpful local near the entrance explaining that there's a riot/holiday/official visit at the place you want to go and it is closed. (Sometimes, taxi drivers are in cahoots with these helpful locals and will purposely drop you off to be received by them.)  The local will then offer to take you to a lesser known but infinitely more beautiful sight or to a nice shop. Generally, the destination is in fact open for business: simply refuse the offer and go and have a look.  Even on the very rare occasions that they are telling the truth, they may not be as helpful as they seem so it would be better to pursue your own backup plan.  Just walk away from them and walk towards the main tourist entrance where they stop following you.\\n\\nThe opposite might in fact take place when arriving by car, especially in places like Rio de Janeiro, where scammers might ask for a fee to \\\"keep your car safe\\\" (a widespread scam in Brazil). While sometimes tourist attractions are in fact closed or under maintenance, scammers will state those are open, and demand a small fee in advance. Taxi drivers will also sometimes take a long route to a place and \\\"forget\\\" to mention the place is closed, then suggest an alternative attraction far away from the original place.\\n\\n=== Art school ===\\n\\nYou are met in the street by people who say they are art students. They speak English well and invite you to visit their school. Then they will try to get you to buy one of their works for an excessive price. The \\\"students\\\" are usually attractive young women who are employed by the gallery to attract customers and to make the customers feel obliged to purchase \\\"their\\\" works to encourage them and repay them for their friendliness.\\n\\nThis scam is practiced in [[China]], particularly in [[Beijing]] and [[Xi'an]].\\n\\n=== Insistent help ===\\n\\nSometimes locals will simply try to force themselves on you to help with a ticket machine, a subway map or directions. They might just be overly helpful but they may also be looking for and demand a small tip for their forced help. In general, be wary of anyone who forces their way into your personal space, and who starts doing things for you without asking you if you need them. If you have received help and then some coinage is demanded, it's probably easier to pay it. However, this kind of situation can also leave you vulnerable to substantial theft so be polite but firm, and then simply firm, by telling the person that you are fine now and that they should leave you alone.\\n\\nA local eagerly offering to \\\"help\\\" take a photo of you might be unwilling to give your camera back, or might demand money for its return; likewise, anyone too eager to \\\"help\\\" you with your luggage may be intending to steal your valuables for themselves. A local may also offer to pose for a photo; only after you take the photo, they demand money.\\n\\n===Border crossings ===\\n{{see also|Border crossing#Fees}}\\n\\n[[File:Crossing the Cambodian Border at Poipet (12225105613).jpg|thumb|At the Poipet border crossing]]\\n\\n[[Poipet]] (on the border between [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]]) is a classic example of the [[border crossing]] scam. \\\"Helpful\\\" people will charge you for doing a useless service (like filling out your application form or doing a \\\"health check\\\"); \\\"friendly\\\" people will charge you twice the normal fee for obtaining a visa (which you can do yourself), crooks will tell you that you must change money at their horrible exchange rates (they will also tell you that there are no ATMs anywhere in the country), and tuk-tuk drivers will charge you some idiotic amount for taking you 100 meters.\\n\\nThe cure is simple: read up on any border crossing before you cross it, know the charges in advance, and don't believe or pay anyone not in uniform. Even then, try to ask another person in uniform to see if you get the same story.\\n\\nUsually the Wikivoyage country articles have a description of the common procedures at all (major) border crossings in the \\\"get in\\\" section. In the case of huge countries, you may want to look in region and city articles as well.\\n\\n===Gifts from beggars===\\n[[File:002 2014 03 19 Numbers.jpg|thumb|If you'd like to buy some wristbands or other trinkets, it's often cheaper in the end to buy it from a vendor than to accept it as a \\\"gift\\\"]]\\n\\nA beggar stops you on the street and gives you a \\\"present\\\", like tying a \\\"lucky charm\\\" around your wrist.  Alternatively, they \\\"find\\\" something like a ring on the street and give it to you.  After a few moments of chit-chat, they start demanding money and follow you until you give them money.\\n\\nAvoiding this scam is easy enough: remember what your mother told you when you were in kindergarten, and don't accept \\\"free\\\" gifts from strangers.  This scam is particularly common in Egypt and the UK. In one variant occasionally seen in particularly large Canadian, American and Japanese cities, the beggars dress as fake monks to solicit these \\\"donations\\\".\\n\\nAnother similar scam involves overly pushy people who pose as collecting money for charity. This is particularly common in developed countries. Usually an old woman will approach you, tie a small flower to your shirt and expect you to \\\"donate\\\" money. They never say the specific charity, they often say \\\"for the children.\\\" Inquiring about the specifics of their \\\"charity\\\" may help scare them off. Typically, if they have no name badges or even a charity name, it's probably not a real charity.\\n\\nBefore entering a situation where you might get hassled, set rules with yourself for how and when you will spend money, stick to the rules, and let other people know.\\n\\n===Dirty shoes scam===\\nA shoe cleaner says your shoes need cleaning, and he points out that there is dirt on your shoes. When you take a look, there really is feces or any other kind of dirt on your shoe (a lot usually). He offers to get them clean again for a very high price. What you most probably did not recognize is that a few meters before that cleaner or a helper has thrown that very dirt onto your shoes.\\n\\nThis scam can also be combined with [[pickpocketing]] or [[theft|distraction theft]], as has been observed in Cairo and Delhi. A variant in Buenos Aires involves someone throwing mustard or some other paste on your coat and then the helper or a third person pickpocketing you and occasionally stealing your bag.\\n\\n===Money collector===\\nWhile you're waiting in a public place, a friendly, well-spoken individual will approach you and engage in conversation. They may ask you questions about where you're from, how long you've been in the country, and so on. \\n\\nAfter some chit-chat, they will let you know that they are a \\\"collector\\\" of money and they want to know if you can give them a few coins, notes, or both from your home country. When you give them what they're asking for, they will then exchange your money for the local currency of the country you're in.\\n\\nA genuine collector of money '''will never''' collect money from random strangers on the street. As ever, never give your money to people you don't know. \\n\\nOne way to fend off a \\\"money collector\\\": firmly, yet politely say that you don't have anything on you. That should get the 'money collector' to leave you alone.\\n\\n==Authority scams==\\n[[File:Policeman in Bucharest.JPG|thumb|Real Romanian police officer<!--cf Maradona-->]]\\n\\n===Fake cops===\\nYou are pulled over by a vehicle that appears to be a police car, often unmarked. The supposed officer says you are about to receive a large fine and points on your license, but you can avoid this by paying a much smaller fee up front in cash. A variant of this involves a fake officer approaching you, claiming that some convoluted minor offence has been committed, and that the victim can avoid the inconvenience of an arrest by paying a fine on the spot. This is ''not'' an official tactic used by law enforcement agencies almost anywhere. In countries with lower levels of corruption, legitimate police officers will either issue a real ticket that must be paid by mail, by bank transfer, or in person, a warning without a fine, or they will let you go completely free.\\n\\nIn another variant, a stranger at an airport asks an unsuspecting bystander to watch their bag or purse. The stranger leaves, returning with a police officer (or someone posing as one) who claims the bag contains drugs or contraband and demands a bribe to evade criminal prosecution.\\n\\nThere are many variants involving strangers suggesting illegal or gray-zone activities, and police officers showing up requesting bribes or \\\"fines\\\", wanting to see your passport or examine you (and steal your wallet or part of its contents). See \\\"Maradona\\\" below.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of scammers, it is quite easy to impersonate a police officer. Police vehicles are typically models that are also sold to civilians, and many of these models have not been redesigned in many years, so older ones can be purchased cheaply. Lights like those found on the dashboards of unmarked police vehicles can be purchased easily in electronics or hobby shops, and police uniforms and badges can be purchased from uniform stores. Though a real officer knows the difference, a na\\u00efve civilian (let alone a foreign visitor) does not. In some countries, corrupt police officers are willing to offer scammers real police uniform and equipment, further blurring the difference between the real and fake ones.\\n\\nSometimes, fines can be paid directly to officers based on local laws and customs. In Serbia, for example, it is legal in some cases to pay 50% of a fine on the spot in cash to a traffic police officer or to pay 100% later in a bank or post office. On the other hand, in countries where police corruption is known to be a serious issue, a real police officer pulling you over may well be trying to extort a bribe. Use your judgement and your knowledge of the country to decide what to do.\\n\\nIf police officers approach you in the course of their duties, they are usually required to show you their warrant cards to identify themselves if they are not in uniform. This will usually be done without any prompting but if not, in most cases you have the right to request to see it; if they refuse to show you their warrant card on request, this is usually a sign of a scam.\\n\\nScammers also often impersonate government officials to extort money from victims, often by telling them over the phone that they have been implicated in a crime, and would usually offer to help clear their name in exchange for a certain sum of money. To avoid this scam, remember that police will usually call you to the station for questioning in person, and will not ask you to give statements over the phone. There are also established legal avenues for fines to be paid; if you are asked to transfer money to some random bank account or in cash to some random person, it is mostly likely a scam.\\n\\n=== Maradona ===\\nThe Maradona is a scam that is very common in [[Romania]], especially in the capital [[Bucharest]]. Someone will approach you and attempt to engage you in a conversation (in English), usually about something vaguely illicit. Seconds later, two men will appear in plain clothes but flashing legitimate-looking police badges. They will accuse you and your \\\"new acquaintance\\\" of some illegal activity (usually 'currency swapping'), and demand to see your wallet and/or passport.\\n\\nDo not hand them these things! Keep your documents and belongings in your pocket and out of sight.\\n\\nWalk away, or yell, or tell them outright that you do not believe that they are the police or suggest that you all walk to the lobby of a nearby hotel (or police station) because you are not comfortable taking out your wallet or papers in the street. These conmen thrive because the police fail to enforce laws against nonviolent crime and some foreigners are easily fooled. They will not physically attack you: the treatment of violent offenders is severe (these men are professionals, and they would never be foolish enough to chance a physical attack). Do not threaten or try to fight them.\\n\\nThere is a more violent variant of this, observed in [[Cartagena (Colombia)]], where you are offered drugs to buy. If you do so, fake police officers emerge immediately and will demand for you to pay a huge fine. They will take you to the nearest ATM and make you withdraw as much money as you can and may even kidnap you.\\n\\n===\\\"Official\\\" asks for souvenir ===\\n\\nAfter an official or someone dressed as one assists you at a transit station such as an airport or train station, that person will ask you for money from your home country as a souvenir.  If you pull out less than what they want, they will use an overly friendly yet insistent manner to demand a higher amount, generally in notes.  In some countries, giving money to an official can be misconstrued as a bribe and can get you in deep water.  It's best to limit conversation as much as possible and when asked for money, to feign ignorance or lack of cash.  This has occurred in Malaysia and China.\\n\\n===Parking attendants===\\n\\nIn many cities, in areas popular with tourists, scammers wear bright \\\"hi-viz\\\" vests and act as attendants at parking facilities. They may show you to an empty space, help you park your car, and collect the parking lot's fee in cash. They may even give you an out-of-date receipt that had been discarded by someone who had previously paid to park in the lot. This fee is ''not'' remitted to the lot's operator, who may ticket you for non-payment. Some people operate this scam at parking lots which normally have no charge at all. In some cases, the attendant offers to watch or protect the driver's car, with the threat (express or implied) that someone might damage or break into a car that is not being watched.\\n\\nMany car parks have prominent signs indicating where you should pay, using a machine or a cash box. At particularly popular events, legitimate attendants will wear hi-viz vests with the venue's name printed on them. If you park at a place with an attended booth or payment machine near the entrance, ignore the attendants and pay at the booth or machine. Do not rely on the observation that other drivers have paid the same attendant who is soliciting you; there have been incidents where a police officer or a parking operator tickets many cars for non-payment.\\n\\n===Tolls===\\nLegitimate tolls use existing structures. But in some rural areas, primitive makeshift gates are set up on little traveled roads frequented by tourists, and money is demanded in exchange for passage. The appearance is given that it could be a \\\"toll\\\" or park entrance fee. In many cases you have few options besides paying and grumbling, but the mere threat of reporting the situation to authorities might do wonders in some cases.\\n\\n==Locals in need==\\n\\n===Panhandlers===\\nPanhandling, the act of [[begging]] for money, is sometimes linked with scams that prey on tourists' emotions.\\n\\n'''In some countries, begging is organised by human trafficking gangs.''' In [[India]], it is believed that thousands of children are kidnapped and forced into begging, and some beggars deliberately disfigure themselves so that they can entice other people into giving them money. Some of the beggars are so proficient at soliciting donations that they can make a livable income from the act. Some female beggars carry '''other people's children''' around to entice others into giving them money.\\n\\nAs heartless as it may sound, '''give all panhandlers a wide berth'''. You can't be sure if you're actually helping them, if you're unintentionally aiding the development of a crime ring, or if you're unintentionally aiding their vices such as drugs and alcohol.\\n\\nIf you genuinely want to help the poor and needy, it is recommended that you volunteer at, speak to members of, or donate to a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Many NGOs actively work to reduce poverty around the world.\\n\\n===Just been robbed ===\\nThis scam involves persons approaching you and asking you if you know where the police station is. They will seem frightened and shaken and inform you that they have just been robbed of the money they needed to get back home which is very likely to be in a different city or even country.  Again, they will get emotional and say the police perhaps won't be of much assistance and they will turn to you for help.  Although they only expect you to happily hand over a small amount, the more people they con the more money they make themselves. This scam also takes the form of refugees escaping a war-torn country, a father who needs to get to a hospital to see his sick child and many other variants.\\n\\n===Begging for medicine to sick family members===\\n\\nThis scam is practiced in parts of Africa, where it's well known that tourists travel with their own medicine such as penicillin or anti-malarial drugs. Beggars will approach on the street, telling a sad tale about their little daughter or son who is dying with malaria or some other disease. They will then ask you if they can have your medicine to save them. The sobbing story makes it difficult to refuse the request and they may accuse you of everything from racism to willingly letting an innocent child die. As soon as they receive your medications they will run away, presumably to save their daughter but in reality they will run to the local pharmacy to sell your medications. Expensive drugs such as Malarone may fetch up to $10 US per tablet<!--although costs have likely dropped as the patents expired in 2013-->.\\n\\nThis scam places a lot of emotional stress on the victims, but remember that if a child really was sick, it's highly unlikely that the father would be running around in the streets begging tourists for medicine. The child would have been brought to the local dispensary, and, if there really was a scarcity in drugs, you would probably be approached in quite a different manner.  Also, remember that giving up hard-to replace prescription drugs might put yourself at risk if you were to contract any illness yourself. The cure is to not get soft-hearted so simply ignore the person and walk away.\\n\\n== Overcharging ==\\n\\nThese scams are based on your ignorance of the area and rely on getting you to pay well over the market rate for goods or services. Some will rely on a helpful local steering you to the goods, but others will simply involve quoting a high price to you. In some countries this is institutionalized: foreigners have to pay more even for genuine sights.\\n\\nGetting a general sense of accommodation price ranges and the like is the best way to prevent being overcharged. In some places, it's assumed that you'll bargain down overcharged prices, in others, you will just have to walk away or pay up for goods although you should still challenge the amount in the case of a service if it is clearly overpriced.\\n\\n===Rental car claims of damage===\\n[[File:Taller Madiautos.JPG|thumb|Mechanic repairing a car door]]\\n\\nWhen you [[car rental|rent a car]] or other vehicle, you are rushed through the process of checking for prior damage, including scratches; the agent may not be so happy about you taking your time to do it. After you return the vehicle, the agency accuses you of having damaged the vehicle, and holds you responsible. Your credit card might be overcharged for a repair fee, whether or not the agency does any repair work on the car. It has been reported by industry insiders that the agents who \\\"notice\\\" the damages are paid commissions on damage fees, so they have an incentive to not notice small damage, then \\\"discover\\\" it upon return.\\n\\nThis tactic has been observed among many brands in the vehicle rental industry, with examples of local operators of Europcar UK, Budget Canada, and Hertz Australia having been prosecuted for defrauding customers.\\n\\nVariants include charging clients for repairs which were never made, or charging for repairs at inflated prices. In some cases, the repair shop and the hire car agent conveniently turn out to both be controlled by the same person or entity, allowing claims such as $1,000 for a windscreen replacement which was never done.<!--[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/budget-rent-a-car-fraud-claims-probed-by-rcmp-1.1238840 cbc]-->\\n\\nYou can protect yourself by taking lots of close-up pictures of the vehicle (inside and out) when you pick it up. You should report all flaws you observe, no matter how small, on the form provided. If you find yourself in a disagreement over damages when you return the vehicle, photographic evidence may get the rental shop to back down, and it is essential if you have to escalate your complaint with the corporate office.\\n\\n===No-change trick===\\n\\nIf you make a payment that requires change, they will refuse it and demand that you pay the exact amount. If you are not very attentive however, they will \\\"forget\\\" to return your initial payment. It may seem strange not to notice this, but in a fast moving and confusing setting, it happens more easily than you think, especially if you are somewhat tired or intoxicated. Incidents like this do also happen in decent looking establishments, such as shopping malls and airport stores. A telltale sign of impending trouble is that the cashier will suddenly lose the ability to speak or understand a single word of English. If you still have all your money in hand, the best course of action is to abandon your goods and walk away.\\n\\nIn another variation, a seller will insist that he does not have change for the item you purchased and that you should accept goods (often of low-quality) in place of your change.  If you ask to \\\"cancel\\\" the sale and get your money back, the seller may become quite pushy in insisting that you take the goods or try to make you feel guilty because they need the money for his family or business is not going well.  If paying with large bills, it is best to '''ask if the seller has change before handing over your money'''.\\n\\nYet another variation involves ticket windows at tourist sites.  Ticket sellers will take your money, take a long time stamping your tickets and talking to colleagues, taking your ID as security for audio guides, etc., and simply \\\"forget\\\" to give you your change.  They may give you some brief information, smile, and say \\\"okay!\\\" to distract you and send you on your way.  Once you leave the window you have no chance of getting your change, so be sure to ask for it and not be distracted by their \\\"helpful information\\\".\\n\\n===Commission shops===\\n[[File:Bargaining Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Usually it's best to do your shopping without help.]]\\nAll over the world, but especially in Asia, are shops that will give your driver or tour guide a commission to bring in tourists. Some tours waste more time at these shops than they spend at actual sights. Often, these shops sell low-quality goods at exorbitant prices; they may claim to be selling handmade cottage industry products or to be child-labor free, but such claims are often false. It is strongly recommended to avoid buying anything from them, especially if you have been directed to the shop by someone.\\n\\nAlternatively, decide what you want and then come back without a driver and [[bargain]] for a substantial discount. In Jerusalem this should be at least 35%, roughly the amount the driver gets.\\nIn some Chinese tourist trap stores, it should be at least 60%; the items are marked with \\\"fixed prices\\\" but the clerks are allowed to give up to 20% off and the guide gets 50% of the selling price, so the minimum price is 40% of the marked one.\\n \\nThese places often have clean, western-style bathrooms, which can be hard to come by otherwise.\\n\\nSee the [[Shopping#Good places|Shopping]] article for some alternatives that are often better than these shops.\\n\\n===Currency swap===\\n\\nIf you are persuaded to buy souvenirs or other items from people selling on the street, look at the change you are given from the sale before putting it in your wallet: it may be in a different currency of similar appearance. For example, in [[China]], a street-vendor may hand you a 50 ruble note in change instead of 50 yuan; the former is worth one tenth as much as the latter. High-value coins, such as the \\u20ac2 coin or the 500 yen coin, may be substituted with similar-looking coins from other countries that are worth much less in exchange, and that you can't spend where you're staying. In some areas, you may get outright counterfeit currency. Be careful that banknotes you receive are not ripped or damaged, as these may not be accepted elsewhere. It is also possible for the vendor to outright steal bills from you in the process of \\\"exchanging\\\" money.\\n\\nOften, bad money drives out good. Many obsolete currencies which are similarly-named to the modern currency look official but are worthless; governments fuel inflation by printing too much money, then create a \\\"new\\\" currency which merely lops a few trailing zeroes off the denominations of the worthless \\\"old\\\" currency. Governments have also \\\"demonetised\\\" specific notes, deliberately rendering them no longer valid. There are also some countries which officially have (or had, such as [[Cuba]]) two currencies, creating opportunities for bait-and-switch on the hapless voyager.\\n\\n===\\\"Better\\\" exchange rate===\\n{{see also|Money}}\\n\\nLocals may offer better currency exchange rate than official banks or authorized currency exchange stores. It is best to avoid these offers since you may not know if you are receiving counterfeit bills or obsolete currencies that the government has phased out and no longer has any value.\\n\\n===Calculated price===\\nPrecious metal items such as gold bracelets are sold as 'dollars per gram' in some countries.  Comparing the price between shops and then against the current gold price makes the practice appear open and transparent, so much so that you may rely on the seller to do the calculation.  It won't be till later, if at all, that you will realize that the price you were charged is much more than the calculated price.\\n\\n===Fair exchange===\\nA vendor may claim to be willing to accept your home currency for a purchase (and most travel venues on an international boundary do so) but their exchange rate is at least 10% worse than any local bank or a dedicated ''bureau de change''. In that case, \\\"US dollars accepted here\\\" by a merchant is no bargain. Sub-prime cheque cashing businesses are also infamous for deliberately unfavorable rates on currency exchange.\\n\\nThis does not need to be a scam. There may be real costs for the merchant to exchange your currency themselves \\u2013 but do both of you a favour and have money (or a credit card) for paying in the local currency.\\n\\nOne pitfall in this respect is '''[[Money#Dynamic currency conversion|dynamic currency exchange]]''': the vendor on a card-paid transaction offers to do the conversion for you and bill your card in your home currency. In most cases, it's best to say \\\"no\\\" and refuse to complete the transaction if the vendor insists, as the exchange rate offered by the merchant is almost invariably worse than whatever's offered by default by your card's issuing bank or credit union.  This is a common scam in Europe.  The card terminal may be handed to you with the choice of local or your home currency.  Always pay in the local currency as your credit card company will invariably provide the better exchange rate.  If the vendor has already selected your home currency, cancel the transaction (red key) and ask them to enter again in local currency.\\n\\nThis scam is also often perpetrated by online vendors. For instance, if you buy online and pay with PayPal in a country that doesn't use the euro or US dollar, you'll have to manually opt out of currency conversion on every transaction, because you're always getting a worse rate than what your bank will charge you. For some currency pairs PayPal's fee can be as much as 10%, while the corresponding bank fee when the customer's account is charged in a different currency, would be only in the neighborhood of 2-4%.\\n\\n===Gem and other resale scams===\\n\\nYou are taken to a jewelry shop and offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to purchase gemstones or jewels at special discount prices.  Another customer in the shop, well-dressed and perhaps from the same country as you, tells how he made incredible profits last year by reselling the gems and is now back for more but to hurry as the sale ends today and you have to pay cash.\\n\\nOf course, once you get back home and try to sell your booty, it turns out to be low-grade and worth only a fraction of what you paid for it.  This scam is particularly prevalent in [[Bangkok]], but variations on the theme with other products that can supposedly be resold for vast profits are common elsewhere too. Another variation involves you exporting the gems for a supposed 'commission' in exchange for the scammer taking a photocopy of your ID cards and/or credit cards, which can of course be used to make a tidy profit via identity theft.\\n\\n===Counterfeit items===\\n[[File:Counterfeit Rolex Watch, dsc4577 5f270.jpg|thumb|Fake Rolex wristwatches]]\\nUnfortunately for the traveller, counterfeiting isn't limited to the manufacture of \\\"Relox\\\" watches or knock-offs of random overpriced luxury goods from CD's and DVD's to watches, clothing, bags and cosmetics. In some regions, branded prescription medicines are prone to being copied by rival manufacturers. Knock-offs vary from legitimately useful generics to poor copies with the wrong amount of an active ingredient; many are diluted and some don't work at all. Outdated medications, which can be unreliable, have a knack for turning up at inopportune moments in out-of-the-way places. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates indicate one million deaths are tied to bogus medicine, with fake anti-malaria tablets in Africa of particular concern.<!-- http://www.dw.de/russia-dabbles-big-time-in-fake-pharma/a-18466188 -->\\n\\nAmerican import law prohibits bringing more than one of any counterfeit item into the country and requires the items be [[border crossing|declared]].  This is especially important when travelling back from [[Asia]], where most counterfeit goods originate.  It's assumed that if you are buying more than one, it's for illegal resale. One counterfeit Rolex for your possession is legal, but two fake Rolexes are illegal and subject to thousands of dollars in fines.\\n\\nCounterfeit currency is also an issue in some regions, particularly in Asia. North Korea is accused by the CIA of printing very convincing (but bogus) US currency, known as \\\"supernotes\\\", for export within the region.\\n\\n===Cruise ship art auctions===\\n\\nCruise passengers are lured to auctions of supposedly investment-grade, collector painting, which are actually industrial inkjet printed copies, euphemistically called ''gicl\\u00e9e''. Free champagne flows like water. The auctions may or may not be conducted by licensed auctioneers and may not adhere to standard auction practices. Since the sales take place at sea, it is difficult for buyers to do due diligence and research on internet prior to making decision. Buyers may have little recourse if the art is misrepresented. Furthermore, in traditional auctions the bidder buys the actual piece on display, whereas cruise ship auctions sell the art on display, but the winning bidder actually receives a different (but supposedly equivalent) piece which is shipped from the auction company's warehouse. Many art buyers at cruise ship auctions have later found that their shipboard masterpieces were worth only a fraction of the purchase price and will never appreciate in value. One major player in cruise ship auction is '''Park West Galleries'''.\\n\\nArt auctions on cruise ships are not investment grade. To prevent being scammed, carefully read any terms and conditions prior to signing anything.\\n\\n===Non-exportable antiques===\\n{{see also|Art and antiques shopping}}\\n\\nIf you consider buying antiques, you need to do your homework on procedures and reputable dealers. Many countries impose various restrictions on exporting relics of their culture or anything of significance. This includes countries where copies of such items are a big business, e.g. [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[India]] and [[Peru]].\\n\\nIn countries such as [[Thailand]] and [[Myanmar]], it is illegal to export anything with Buddha on it (even statues of Buddha)  unless you have permission from the government. These countries consider it extremely disrespectful to use Buddha as a decoration piece. \\n\\nUnless you are a collector, you should buy items that are obviously recent copies. If you try for the real thing you might pay much more than for an honest copy, face problems at the border, and \\u2013 after having paid fines, bribes and a lawyer \\u2013 get home with what turns out to be a copy nevertheless.\\n\\nIn some cases your purchases may be confiscated at the border, you may have to pay fines or a bribe not to be arrested \\u2013 and the confiscated item is returned to the seller to be sold to the next unsuspecting tourist.\\n\\nYour own country may also apply [[border crossing|import restrictions]] to items such as [[animal ethics|animal pelts]] (for a long list of species, some of which are not actually endangered) or anything containing ivory. Know before you go.\\n\\n===Plastic bag code===\\n\\nIn some countries where [[haggling]] is common, people at markets may have an arrangement where they will put purchases in different colored bags to signal how much a customer has paid, allowing other vendors to charge accordingly. For instance, at a certain market, a white bag may indicate that a customer paid the usual price whereas a blue bag may indicate that they paid a higher amount - vendors will ask a higher price if they see someone carrying a lot of blue bags. Different markets have different color codes, and some may have several stages of overcharging.\\n\\nTo avoid this, try to figure out how much the usual prices for things are before making your purchase and haggling the price aggressively if they are charging too much, and putting purchases in a backpack or durable shopping bag rather than using the plastic bags provided.\\n\\n===Low cost airlines===\\nWhile [[low cost airlines]] are legitimate and often genuinely cheaper operations, some of their business practices resemble scams. Such airlines are known to quote prices \\\"from\\\" a certain amount of money. A ticket for London to Milan \\\"from\\\" \\u20ac19 sounds tempting, but those prices usually refer to a small contingent of tickets that sell out quickly. These teaser prices are almost always quoted for one-way fares and don't include a variety of fees and taxes, including fees for carry-on luggage and for printing a boarding pass at an airport kiosk. Read the fine print ''very'' carefully when you book with a low cost carrier.\\n\\nSome low cost airlines are notorious for outrageous fees, such as \\u20ac50 for printing a boarding pass or US$100 for half a pound of excess baggage. Another common trick is for low cost airlines to fly out of secondary or tertiary airports, often converted former military airbases. Especially in Europe, these airports are not connected to any sort of public transport, requiring you to buy an expensive bus ticket (often through an airline partner company) to get to your destination. Low cost carriers encourage airports to use deceptive names like \\\"Barcelona\\\"\\u2013[[Girona]], \\\"D\\u00fcsseldorf\\\"\\u2013Weeze, \\\"M\\u00fcnchen\\\"\\u2013[[Memmingen]], or \\\"Frankfurt\\\"\\u2013[[Hahn]], concealing the large distances between the airport and its nominal city. Also note that while Girona or Memmingen are sizeable towns themselves, [[Hahn]] is a tiny village of less tha a thousand inhabitants in the sticks. [[air travel in the US|In the US]], low cost airlines often fly to airports closer to the city they are named after, but high fees may apply as well. That being said, legacy airlines have now copied several of the low cost airlines' business practices, especially on short distance routes and especially in the US. The lowest fares on legacy carriers, known as \\\"basic economy,\\\" may not include seat selection, carry-on luggage, or frequent flyer miles. The upgrade from basic economy to economy may be cheaper than the sum of the additional fees that basic economy passengers would pay.\\n\\nIn short: read the fine print carefully, don't order any extra services you won't need (e.g., \\u20ac10 insurance for a \\u20ac20 flight), and jump through all the hoops the airline makes you jump through.\\n\\n===Timeshare presentations===\\n\\nMany popular resort areas have touts offering \\\"free\\\" tickets to shows or attractions or \\\"free\\\" hotel stays for your next vacation. In many cases, these are come-ons for [[timeshare]] presentations. Timeshare presentations may be offered only to people meeting certain qualifications: for example, a couple must be married (and both spouses must attend), of a particular age, with a particular income, of a particular nationality, and fluent in a particular language.\\n\\nTimeshare presentations can easily take up half a day of your time, including the time to get to and from the (often remote) presentation venue. To get your incentive, you must watch a lengthy presentation, take a tour, and/or sit down with a sales representative who tries to pitch you on spending a lot of money, potentially US$10,000 or more, for a timeshare membership. These memberships may be worthwhile if you like to visit a particular place every year, although their total cost of ownership includes annual fees, which are often downplayed during the sales presentation, and can make the timeshare more expensive than a hotel or vacation home. Very few timeshares are resold for more than their original purchase price.\\n\\nThe incentives that are offered are often overvalued, being equivalent to coupons that you could get at your hotel for free. Discounted tickets may be available from last-minute ticket booths or from secondhand sales (although be mindful of bogus ticket scams). The promise of a \\\"free\\\" hotel stay in the future may be contingent on you attending another timeshare presentation. To discourage people from signing up for these presentations spuriously, some operators ask for cash up front, only refunding the money after the person attends the presentation and sales pitch in full. Leaving early, or being overly rude, might cause the salesperson to keep your money.\\n\\n== Coercion ==\\n\\nThese scams rely on trapping you in a bad situation and forcing you to pay money to get out of it. They're best prevented by avoiding the situation; once you're in it, you may well have no option but to pay whatever it takes to get out of it safely. Many of these scams are bordering on illegal.\\n\\n=== Free tours ===\\n\\nYou are offered a \\\"free tour\\\" of a shop or factory way out of town. Your driver may then suggest that you'll need to buy something if you want a ride back. The best prevention is avoidance as if you're stuck out there you might well be compelled to do as he 'suggests'. Don't accept any kind of lift or offer of a tour without having a basic idea of where you're going and how you will be able to get back if your driver deserts you.  Of course, if you are strong and assertive from the beginning in dealing with any suspicious characters, you can limit your chances of being involved in this kind of sting.  However, always bear in mind that the perpetrator may be carrying a knife or be willing to assault you if the situation arises.\\n\\n=== Passport as security for debt or rental ===\\n:''See also [[Theft#Passport and identity theft]]''\\n\\nYou rent equipment like a jet ski or motorbike. You are asked to give your passport as a security guarantee. After returning the rented goods, the owner claims you damaged them and will ask for exaggerated prices to compensate or will claim to have \\\"lost\\\" your passport. Later, the police or lost property office want a substantial \\\"donation\\\" for its return. If you do not agree, they threaten to keep your passport. This scam is used in almost all tourist resorts in [[Thailand]] and is very effective.\\n\\n'''Never hand over your passport as a security or guarantee under any circumstances.'''  Pay cash (and get a receipt), or hand over something comparatively worthless, like your library card. You can also try going elsewhere; often the threat will be enough.\\n\\nNote that most passports include wording such as this (direct quote): \\\"This passport is the property of the government of Canada \\u2026 If your passport is surrendered to any person or agency outside the Canadian government (e.g. to obtain a visa) and is not promptly returned, report the facts to [an embassy or consulate].\\\" You should only hand your passport to a foreign government official such as a border guard, to a travel agent or an employer who needs it to arrange a visa, or to a clerk who needs it briefly to verify your identity. Your government can press the host government to fix the problem, and in theory that government is obligated to do so promptly.\\n\\n=== Overpriced street vendors ===\\n\\nYou decide on a whim to buy a piece of one of the massive cakes covered in nuts and fruits that are a fairly common sight in the tourist-laden parts of cities in [[China]]. You ask the price, and the man tending to the cake tells you it depends on how much you want. You show him how much. Immediately, he slices the cake, weighs it out, and gives you an extremely high price. He tells you that since he already sliced the cake, you have to buy it.\\n\\nThe best thing to do in this or any similar situation is probably to leave your purchase and just walk away. If they hassle you, threaten to call the police. Like the art school scam, this ruse depends on using your guilt to coerce you out of your money.\\n\\n===Solicitation of money by photographic subjects===\\n{{seealso|Travel photography#Stay safe|Video recording#Stay safe}}\\n\\nA local in a colorful costume offers to pose for a photo with a traveller, persistently asking \\\"Want to take a picture?\\\". The visitor takes one picture. The local then starts aggressively demanding money. The traveller objects, only to be met with a string of obscenities at best and physical force at worst.\\n\\nThe scam is that neither the price nor the intent to demand money is disclosed up front. Payment is only demanded after the visitor has taken the photo and it's \\\"too late\\\".\\n\\nThe operators are not licensed street vendors (they evade regulations by mischaracterizing their fee for service as a \\\"tip\\\" or [[tipping|gratuity]], only to become rude, aggressive or violent when the victim refuses to pay). While they may appear as anything from bogus Sesame Street characters (who typically demand $2\\u20135) to scantily clad women wearing little other than a thong and body paint (who take $10\\u201320), they invariably do not have permission from the creators of any trademarked, copyrighted characters they're impersonating.<!--http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/09/cookie-monster-elmo-times-square-trouble/2069037/--> As solicitations occur most often in high-traffic, touristed areas like [[New York City]] whose visitors are already subjected to [[begging]], aggressive panhandling and various scams, their conduct reflects poorly on the city to outsiders.\\n\\nWhile the best response to \\\"Want to take a picture?\\\" in some places is simply to walk away, parents [[travelling with children]] may find it very awkward to explain to tiny tots why the Cookie Monster was arrested in [[Times Square]] for pushing a two-year-old child to the ground (his mother refused to pay for a photo)<!-- http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/08/osvaldo-quiroz-lopez-cookie-monster-times-square-arrested_n_3037550.html and http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cookie-monster-lookalike-accused-of-shoving-child-in-times-square/ --> or why officers carried an emotionally disturbed Elmo out of [[Central Park]] Zoo screaming obscenities (he was ejected for begging from the zoo's visitors).<!--http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/25/elmo-impostor-kicked-out-_n_1623837.html-->\\n\\n=== Rigged gambling games ===\\n[[File:Shell game in Berlin.jpg|thumb|300px|Shell game in [[Berlin]]]]\\nIn many jurisdictions, [[gambling]] of any kind is illegal. Even in countries where gambling is legal, only gamble at casinos and other well-reputed gambling venues.\\n\\nGambling scams come in many forms, from the three-card monte cup shufflers of Europe's city streets to dodgy gambling dens in the backstreets of South-East Asia. In most cases, the target is alone. The conman strikes up a conversation and then claims to have family in the target's home country. After some friendly conversation, the target is then invited to a card game or some other type of gambling: just for \\\"fun\\\" of course.\\n\\nThe target is taken somewhere far from the tourist area. After doing a few \\\"practice\\\" games, then they start to play for real. Of course, the game is totally rigged. After losing, the target will find his \\\"friend\\\" not so friendly anymore, and then a massive amount of money will be demanded (often totaling in the thousands of dollars). Violence might be used to settle the debts.\\n\\nTourists are by no means the only targets for this. Professional Chinese-Canadian scammers routinely take huge amounts from Chinese overseas students in crooked mah jong games, for example.\\n\\n=== Cash on the sidewalk ===\\n\\nAs you stand on the sidewalk studying your map or guidebook, a passerby will point to a roll of bills, wallet, or gold jewelry on the ground nearby and ask if it is yours. They pick it up and offer to split the stuff with you. If you agree, a couple of heavies will soon appear demanding their money back, much more than you originally \\\"found\\\" of course. This scam is most common in Russia and Ukraine but it's also used in France.\\n\\n===Free hair salon treatment===\\n\\nMost commonly in Asian countries, a good-looking hair dresser would stand outside the salon and pass out coupons for a \\\"free\\\" shampoo hair wash and \\\"free\\\" head massage.  Even if you decline, they will continue to be persistent. As soon as they succeed in seating you down in a salon chair and start wetting your hair, they'll explain how damaged your hair is and which specific products will help. The prices are absurdly set and often 2 to 3 times more expensive than in the US for a similar salon treatment.  It will be much more difficult to refuse then after they've stroked up a friendly conversation and compliments.  The best way to avoid this is simply tell them you've just had a haircut and are not interested.\\n\\n== Theft ==\\nVarious scams are outright theft:\\n* [[Theft#Distraction theft|Distraction theft]], in its various forms, usually involves one villain distracting the victim while an accomplice steals items of value.\\n* [[Theft#Payment card theft|Payment card theft]]s include various schemes to steal credit card numbers (card skimming) or copy the PINs and magnetic strips of ATM/cash-point cards. In some schemes the card itself is stolen, in others the card information is stolen and used to make fraudulent transactions.\\n* [[Pickpockets]] steal items (usually wallets, passports or other valuables) from people's clothing and bags as they walk in a public place.\\n\\nSee the main articles on [[pickpockets]] and [[theft]].\\n\\nA few scams involve putting you in a position where someone can take your money by force.\\n\\n=== Friendly locals wanting to go out for a drink ===\\nWhile walking down the street you may be approached by attractive friendly locals wanting to go out for a beer or a drink. Then they tell you the drink costs way more than it actually does. Or worse, they just wait for you to become inebriated (or tamper with your drink to drug you in some manner) and take your money. See also [[Common scams#Clip joint|clip joints]], below.\\n\\n=== Car trouble ===\\n\\nPeople  will approach you on the street and tell you that their car just ran out of fuel or is broken down and is only a few blocks away. They'll usually first ask for money for gas.  If you don't believe them or try to walk away, they may beg you to come with them to the car to see that they are telling the truth. They may offer you some kind of security such as their jewelry and be well-dressed and plausible seeming.\\n\\nDo not give people money in these and similar scenarios. Do not follow them to where they claim their car is. If you suspect they are really in trouble, you could report their predicament to police.\\n\\n=== Street brawls ===\\n\\nYou are walking down the street alone and all of a sudden you see many people attacking one person (sometimes an old man or a woman). When you want to help, people will take photos of you and will blackmail you afterwards to go to the police. Now you find out that the attacked person, the attackers and the photographer are a group. They will blackmail you for large amounts of money, because if they go to the police, you most likely need to leave the country (for example in China).\\n\\nAs obvious as it may sound, '''do not feel tempted to act like a hero'''; you could face serious trouble for doing so. If you witness a fight, walk away or alert the police.\\n\\n=== Payment card scams ===\\n{{seealso|Theft#Payment card theft}}\\nYour credit card number, your debit card PIN, or even the card itself is an obvious target for theft and fraud. Some of these scams are distraction thefts (one person distracts you while the other steals your card), some switch a merchant's debit keypad for a tampered or fake version, some add extra hardware to ATM cashpoints to skim the magnetic stripe from payment cards.\\n\\nIn one variant (which appears occasionally as a [[#Taxi scams|taxi scam]]) a vendor asks for payment by debit card and presents a keypad to enter a PIN. The vendor then hands back a card that looks like the one the voyager originally provided... but it's the wrong card. The scammer now has your card, the keypad was rigged to steal your PIN and the thieves go on a spree from cashpoint to cashpoint, emptying your account. Another variant is the [[#Food and beverage scams|restaurateur]] who wanders off with your credit card, either to secretly copy your card number or to take out a cash advance at your expense.\\n\\nAnother scam that has been found in [[Dubai]] relies on contactless payments. A shopkeeper selling some sort of goods attractive to tourists will quote a particular price for these goods, wait for the victim to get their card out to tap (or activate Apple Pay/Google Wallet on their phone) and then quickly switch out the contactless terminal for a different one set to charge a much higher price than was agreed - after which point the shopkeeper will hurry you out of the store and/or threaten you to leave. This is particularly difficult to then dispute with the credit card company, since it is your word against the shop's that the price paid is not what was agreed. The simplest solution here is to avoid buying from tourist traps as far as is practicable, or otherwise to pay in cash for such tchotchkes if you really must do so.\\n\\n=== Counterfeit tickets and stolen goods ===\\nThere are multiple variants of these scams. As examples:\\n\\n* Someone lists hard-to-find tickets to a concert on an on-line marketplace, but these tickets were forged and are not accepted at the venue.\\n* A person at a public transport station offers, for a discounted price, to scan their unlimited pass so that you can go through a fare gate. Some cities' public transport systems employ fare inspectors, so even if you gain entry to a train in this way, a fare inspector may ask to see your ticket while you are aboard, and they may fine you or eject you from a train if you do not have a ticket in hand. Some cities' transport systems also expect travellers to scan their pass as they ''exit'' the system, so if you do not have a ticket in hand, you will need to find a staff member and potentially pay a penalty to exit at your destination.\\n* Using a marketplace, someone sells a [[mobile telephone]] which has been reported as stolen. Mobile carriers place stolen devices on a national blacklist, so they can't be subscribed anywhere. A fraudulent mobile phone may also be blacklisted if the prior owner was in a billing dispute with their carrier.\\n* Someone sells a previously valid but non-transferable ticket, such as a [[Disneyland]] multi-day pass with a few days left.\\n\\nIf the fraudulent item was purchased in a public place for cash, the buyer has no recourse when their item turns out to be bogus. In some countries, possession of stolen goods is a crime, even if the buyer did not know that an item was stolen when they purchased it. To protect tourists and local merchants, authorities in places including [[Mallorca]] and [[Pisa]] fine tourists who buy any goods from unlicensed merchants in touristic areas.\\n\\nTo avoid being a victim of these scams, buy your tickets and goods from officially licensed retailers or resellers. If you are planning to attend an event, visit the event's web site to understand how tickets may be purchased and resold. In the U.S., sports teams and concert promoters often designate an official ticket exchange where electronic tickets may be resold, at an agreed-upon price, and with fees imposed on both the buyer and the seller. This makes resold tickets more expensive, but an official ticket exchange will usually offer a money-back guarantee in case the tickets turn out to be invalid or if the event is cancelled.\\n\\n=== Event scams ===\\n\\nScammers don't rest during the holidays. Sometimes an event organiser will pop up just long enough to announce a big [[Halloween]] or [[Christmas and New Year travel|New Year's Eve]] bash, with pricey tickets for admission sold in advance. The buyers of these tickets only find the event doesn't exist, isn't as advertised or that the tickets are counterfeit on the day of the event; at that point, because the vendor was a short-lived seasonal, pop-up operation, they're nowhere to be found. Another variant is a mail order vendor peddling seasonal merchandise (such as Halloween costumes) that either doesn't arrive, are not as advertised or only turn up after the event is over. Try to return the two sizes too small Halloween garb that didn't arrive until November, and the seasonal pop-up merchant is conveniently gone \\u2014 closed for the season. There's nothing inherently tying these scams to one specific time of year; the various holidays just provide convenient marketing opportunities.\\n\\nIn addition, particularly on social media sites like Facebook, advertisers promote fun-looking events based on noteworthy artistic works, such as the Willy Wonka stories and Vincent van Gogh's artwork. Some of these events use AI-generated promotional artwork or similar titles to legitimate events, to confuse potential customers. Because some famous artwork is in the public domain, anyone can produce an event based on it. Seek out reviews on reputable websites before you buy tickets. If an event tours from one city to another, you should be able to find reviews of the same exhibition \\u2014\\u00a0double-check the name to be sure \\u2014 in other cities. Some event promoters have sold expensive, non-refundable tickets, and delivered a very disappointing show.\\n\\n=== Sex workers ===\\n\\nSex workers are a common sight in many cities, and you may find yourself interested in hiring one. Many sex workers are honest and committed to doing their work safely and consensually for all parties involved. However, in some cases, those working in this industry can be involved in a variety of crimes:\\n[[File:Bangkok street signs.jpg|thumb|Neon signs in the red light district of Bangkok]]\\n* leading you into an armed robbery\\n* having a confederate go through your clothes while you are out of them\\n* taking your hotel room key, which is turned over to burglars or thieves\\n* \\\"cash and dash\\\", where a provider accepts payment for services that are never provided, then leaves\\n* advance fee scams, where the pimp (or a thug) arrives without the service provider and demands the cash up front - before vanishing with the victim's money in pocket and no service provided\\n* a bogus \\\"outraged family member\\\" (or cop) appearing and needing to be bought off; alternately, this person's arrival is carefully timed to occur immediately after the provider has accepted payment and before any service is rendered, as effectively a \\\"cash and dash\\\" scheme\\n* hidden cameras, or collection of compromising material ('kompromat')  to be used for eventual blackmail and coercion.\\n\\nIn some instances, the sex workers may have been coerced by human traffickers or organized crime, or have substance abuse issues that make them vulnerable to exploitation.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, the presumption is that victims will not call police; the clients are either ashamed to have to pay for a 'companion', afraid to be outed to a spouse on whom they are cheating, fearful of violent retribution by those running the scams or afraid of legal prosecution as even jurisdictions which nominally do not criminalize solicitation may still outlaw a long and arbitrary list of related activities.\\n\\nEven if you do not allow one to lead you anywhere, \\\"streetwalkers\\\" (sex workers who solicit clients on the street, rather than online or through a service) can pose risks. Some of those engaged in sex work may be tempted to steal cash or other valuables from a client. In some countries, such as [[China]] or 48 states of the USA, prostitution is illegal and hotel staff may have the local police arrive at your room door not long after you check in.\\n\\nIn countries where prostitution is not fully legalized (and even in some cases where it is), such establishments may have links with other forms of criminal activity, notably various types of gangs, drug dealers and money laundering. A few are [[#Clip joints|clip joints]]; as legal restrictions in many jurisdictions make providers claim to sell \\\"massage\\\", \\\"companionship\\\" or just about anything except actual \\\"full-service\\\" prostitution, these folks will gladly take the victim's money, then claim the payment was \\\"just for the massage\\\" and demand more money repeatedly. The mark is unceremoniously ejected from the premises (with no actual service provided) once his wallet is empty.\\n\\n==Taxi scams==\\n{{Seealso|Taxis}}\\n\\nAirports, stations and other places where people [[Arriving in a new city|arrive in a new city]] and places with many tourists are favorite places for all kinds of touts offering their (often overpriced) services. This includes taxi drivers and people pretending to be taxi drivers.\\n\\nUse the official taxi line if there is one, and be extra alert on what the official (or trustworthy) taxis look like. If they cannot be distinguished, you may want to walk away from the hotel or attraction and flag down a taxi driving by the main road, or call a taxi to a nearby non-touristy place. In places where it is common for locals to use a smartphone app to call a taxi, find out what the reliable apps are and consider using them.\\n\\n===Scenic taxi rides===\\nSince you don't know the area, taxi drivers can take advantage of you by taking a long route to your hotel and getting a large metered fare. While it is hard to learn a new city well enough to know a good route before you arrive for the first time, the best prevention is knowledge. Ask your hotel roughly what the taxi fare should be when you book or ask them to arrange a pickup with them if they offer the service. Often you can negotiate a fixed price with a taxi before you get in or ask what the range of fares to your hotel will be. Good taxi drivers are on the route to your hotel every day and can give you a very accurate price before you or your luggage get into a cab. This scam can be often used by taxis in touristic cities of [[Turkey]] like [[Antalya]].\\n\\n===Taxis not using the meter===\\nIn cities where [[taxicabs|taxis]] have fare meters, unscrupulous drivers will often try to drive off with tourists without turning the meter on. When you arrive they'll try and charge fares from the merely expensive (twice or thrice the usual fare) to really outrageous prices, depending on how ambitious they are. If you're in an area known for this scam and you know where you're going and want them to use the meter (rather than arrange a fixed fare), ask them to turn the meter on just before you get in. If they say that it is broken or similar, walk away and try another taxi. They will often concede: a metered fare is better than no fare.\\n\\n===Using the wrong metered rate===\\nA related scam is using the wrong metered rate, such as setting it to a more expensive late-night setting during the day. You need location-specific information to prevent this one. A typical rip-off scenario involves a device known as a \\\"turbine\\\". By pressing specially installed button (usually on the left of the steering wheel, or next to the clutch pedal) the driver starts the \\\"turbine\\\" and fools the meter to charge much faster than the usual speed. The change in the charging speed is obvious, so dishonest drivers talk and show around a lot, to make their passengers keep an eye off the taxi meter. The best way to prevent the driver from starting the turbine is to keep an eye on the meter at all times.\\n\\nAnother way this scam can be done is for drivers to use some \\\"taxi fare meter\\\" smartphone app instead of the standalone device, which is already set up in a way to charge several times faster than it should be, but after turning it on, they promptly switch the meter app to another one like a map, so you won't see the actual price going up the way it is until you arrive. This practice was seen used by taxis in the airports of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\\n\\nWhen suspicious, ask the taxi to drop you off at your (or any) hotel lobby. Security at most hotels can intervene if you are being overcharged.\\n\\n===Luggage held hostage===\\nWatch your luggage as it is loaded! If you put your luggage in the trunk, they might refuse to give you your luggage back unless you pay a much higher price the actual fare. Remember to always write down or remember the taxi number or driver's number in case of problems and keep your luggage in your hand at all times if possible. Often, just writing down the taxi number will make them back down if they are keeping your luggage hostage, but be careful that they are not armed or are trying to rob you by other means than just driving away with your luggage.\\n\\n===\\\"Per person\\\" taxi charge===\\nTaxi, tuk-tuk, or auto-rickshaw drivers will agree on a price. When you arrive at your destination, they may or may not tell you that the vehicle is a share vehicle, and they will tell you that the price quoted is per person. The tricky thing is that a per-person charge (or a flat rate plus a per person charge) is standard in some cities and countries, so it's important to research the destination beforehand and make sure you and the driver are both clear on what the price means before you start riding. If you know the driver is trying to scam you, you can almost always just give them the agreed-upon fare and walk away. Just make sure that you have the correct change as you won't get any money back before agreeing on the price.\\n\\n==Food and beverage scams==\\nFrom the barkeeper who charges full price for watered-down drinks to the restaurateurs who give themselves generous tips using their diner's payment cards, there are various schemes in which travellers are overcharged for food and beverage service.\\n\\nSome unexpected charges are not scams, although they may seem suspicious. In some countries, such as the US and Canada, taxes and service charges are not typically included in prices shown on menus. Conversely, conveniences such as glasses of water, soft drink refills, condiment packets, and bread or tortilla chips are expected to be free at many US restaurants, but they normally cost money in some other countries. It may be normal for foreigners to pay higher prices than locals do. \\n\\nBefore concluding that an unexpected charge is a scam, familiarize yourself with local practices. You can also ask at your hotel or at a local tourist information office.\\n\\n===Dual menus===\\n\\nA bar or restaurant gives you a menu with reasonable prices and takes it away with your order. Later, they present a bill with much higher prices. If you argue, they produce a menu with those higher prices on it. This scam is known in [[Romania]] and in bars in [[China]] among other places. The best way to avoid this is to stay out of sleazy tourist bars. Another option is to take a picture of the menu with your phone camera. If the restaurant argues, you can always tell them that you want to send it to your friends because they otherwise wouldn't believe the prices are so low. You can then proceed to take a picture of the food for your foodie-blog (which might come in handy if the items on your bill don't match the items you ordered or were served).\\n\\nYou could also try hanging on to your menu or paying when your drinks or food are delivered, preferably with the right change. Watch out for asking for a menu in English, as the prices on the menu are sometimes higher than the menu in the native language, although because of the difficulty of navigating a foreign-language menu, foreigners may justify this as a translation fee.\\n\\nIn some places where there is a common [[money|parallel currency]], usually US dollars or euros, there might be a menu with prices quoted both in local currency and the parallel currency. Paying in the local currency is almost certain to be cheaper. Also, be wary of restaurants that offer [[Money#Dynamic_currency_conversion|dynamic currency conversion]] (DCC), where the payment terminal gives you the choice of paying in multiple currencies. DCC rates are typically worse than the rates that your credit card will apply, even if your card has a foreign transaction fee. If you are offered a choice of paying in multiple currencies, the local currency is likely to be cheapest.\\n\\nA variation of this scam is one where your waiter will offer you a \\\"special\\\" that is not shown on the menu. The meal will not be very special but will come with a price considerably higher than anything else on the menu. Also, touts and barkers might advertise low-price offers, or an attractive discount is prominently announced by signage outside the restaurant, but then the bill is calculated with normal prices. Perhaps the offer was valid only at some hours (not now), with some discount card or for a variant different from what you got. Check when ordering.\\n\\n===Unexpected cover charges===\\n\\n[[File:Restaurant (36417052420).jpg|thumb|Table at a restaurant in Italy]]\\n\\nWhen the bill arrives at a restaurant, an extra cover charge is on it. Restaurants in some parts of Italy call this ''pane e coperto'', an extra charge for bread (''pane'') and service (''coperto'' or ''servizio''). Some restaurateurs will try to slip them in cover charges by burying a one-line \\\"service not included\\\" in a lengthy menu. Sometimes, these extra charges are added to the bill for visitors, but not for locals. In some countries it is normal to add taxes, service charges etc. on top of the nominal prices, but when they aren't common and aren't disclosed up front, they might be a scam. Read up on the country, not to be surprised by the normal additions.\\n\\nA fast-talking man (or attractive woman) standing outside a strip club will offer you free entry, complimentary drinks and/or lap dances to get you inside the club. They'll often speak fluent English, are able to identify your accent, and are very charismatic. The drinks and dances are indeed free, but when you try to leave, there's a \\\"membership fee\\\" or \\\"exit fee\\\" of at least \\u20ac100. There will also be security waiting at the door for non-payers.\\n\\nA variant of this is practiced in [[Bangkok]], where touts with laminated menus offer sex shows and cheap beer.  The beer may indeed be cheap, but they'll add a stiff surcharge for the show. Similarly in [[Brazil]], expect to pay an extra \\\"artistic couvert\\\" if live music is playing. No one will warn you of this because it's considered normal there. Ask how much it is before you are seated.\\n\\n===Clip joints===\\n[[File:Brasarinha.png|thumb|It's often a bad idea to listen to complete strangers, who out of the blue, are inviting you to a drink]]\\nYou're approached by an attractive, well-dressed, local gentleman or woman, who suggests going for a drink in a favorite nightspot.  When you arrive, the joint is nearly deserted, but as soon as you sit down some scantily clad girls plop down next to you and order a few bottles of champagne.  Your \\\"friend\\\" disappears, the bill runs into hundreds or even thousands of dollars, and heavies block the door and flex their muscles until you pay up. A variant is the \\\"B-girl\\\" or bar girl scam, where organized crime recruits attractive women to go into legitimate bars, seek out rich men who display expensive shoes and watches and lure them into \\\"after-hours clubs\\\" which are not licensed (or not otherwise open to the public) and which charge thousands of dollars to the drunken victims' payment cards. Often, the victims are too intoxicated to remember exactly what happened.\\n\\nThis is particularly common in Europe's larger cities, including [[London]], [[Istanbul]] and [[Budapest]]. [[Florida]] is problematic due to a state law which directs police to arbitrarily force victims to pay all disputed charges and then attempt to recover the money by filing a dispute with the credit card issuers\\u2014an uphill battle.<!-- http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/04/07/17-charged-south-beach-alcohol-scam/ -->  The best defense is not to end up in this situation: avoid going to bars with people you just met, pick the bar yourself, or at least back out immediately if they want to go somewhere that is not packed with locals. In Istanbul this scam is also common with places packed with locals, where they scam the tourists, but not the locals, as it is a difficult and time consuming process to get the police to do anything. It is best to pay by credit card, then to dispute the charge immediately after it is processed. You may also need to change the number on a credit card used in this way, as criminals may attempt to use your card to make other fraudulent charges. While police in some jurisdictions are unlikely to be of much assistance, filing a report may make it easier to get the charges reversed.\\n\\nA variety of this scam is extortionate tea ceremonies in [[Beijing]] and other cities in [[China]]. You will be approached by women who speak very good English, spend 30 minutes in conversation with you and invite you to have tea with them. The tea house they take you to will be empty, and you will end up in a situation of having to pay a huge amount of money for a few cups of tea. This is incredibly easy to fall into, as the scammers are often willing to spend considerable time \\\"chatting you up\\\" before suggesting going for tea. The best way to avoid this would be to not engage in conversation in the first place. Failing that, refuse to go with them to have tea, or if you find yourself having been fooled as far into going to the tea house with them, insist on leaving as soon as you can (e.g. fake receiving an urgent phone call from your friend), and ask for the bill (as each different variety of tea you drink will doubtless add up to the final cost).\\n\\n===Gratuities===\\n\\nRead the sections about [[tipping]] before you visit a country. Restaurants that include a service charge in the bill may still prompt credit card users to add a tip. You are free to do so if you choose, although it may not be necessary or expected, and your tip may be retained by the restaurant owner and not distributed to the wait staff.\\n\\nIn some countries, such as the US and Canada, '''automatic gratuities''', or \\\"auto-grat\\\" in restaurant slang, may be added to the bills of large groups, such as parties of 6 or more. These should be indicated on the menu. Even if your bill includes an automatic gratuity, it may include a line for you to add another tip. Unscrupulous restaurants may add an auto-grat to a smaller party's bill in the hopes that, unaware, the guests will add an additional tip on top of the auto-grat. When the bill arrives, if you see numbers pre-printed for the subtotal, sales tax (if applicable), and gratuity, you do not need to provide an additional tip.\\n\\nPhone- and tablet-based payment systems may offer a choice of several shortcut tip amounts. This is prone to manipulation in two ways. One is to provide higher shortcut tip amounts, such as 25%, 30%, or 35%, instead of the 20% that is commonly [[United_States_of_America#Tipping|tipped in the United States]] at full-service restaurants. The other is to apply the tip to the total, inclusive of tax, rather than to the subtotal, which excludes tax. In a city with a 10% sales tax, that effectively turns a 20% tip into a 22% tip. When in doubt, you can compute your preferred tip yourself and choose the \\\"other\\\" option to input it manually.\\n\\n==Lodging scams==\\nIndependent hotels and franchises of large hotel companies have engaged in unscrupulous practices. Most hotels are honest, and you may never encounter these problems. Still, the customer should be watchful, and should be aware of what signs to look out for.\\n\\nIt is common for a guest to check into a hotel when they are tired after many hours of travel, or to check out when they are in a hurry to catch a plane or get to another destination. At these times, a customer is unlikely to argue. Guests in the middle of a stay are also unlikely to argue about being cheated due to fear of retaliation from management. Guests who intend to check out early in the morning should review their charges the night before check-out and should settle their bill at that time, if possible. This avoids an uncomfortable choice in case you've been overcharged: do you contest the charges while you're tired and you have a flight to catch, or do you pay the bill and try to negotiate a refund later?\\n\\n===Advance fee scams===\\nYou book a room in advance. Soon after, you receive a payment request that appears to be from the hotel, and you pay. When you check in, the hotel tells you that they have not received your payment and demands to be paid again. Alternatively, the hotel may attempt to charge for more nights than originally agreed to. They may also insist on payment in cash. Check Wikivoyage guides so that you understand local customs; in some areas, it is normal to pay for your hotel in full upon arrival or when you make your reservation. If you are suspicious about a payment request, call the hotel directly (not another phone number printed on a suspicious invoice) to verify its legitimacy.\\n\\nIn another variant, you see an attractive cottage for rent in an on-line advert, you pay to reserve it in advance, and when you show up, you see other people inside, with no awareness of your booking.<!-- http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/08/02/kijiji_vacation_rental_scam_strikes_again_at_the_same_cottage.html uses the term \\\"Goldilocks moment\\\" with a hot meal already cooking as the tip-off the cottage is already occupied. --> As the scammer placing the ads has no tie to the property, they are suddenly nowhere to be found and the money is gone. Somewhat more audacious scammers rent out nonexistent cottages, often next to such small roads that they don't show up on Google Street View. Once you're there, you'll find out that there's only wilderness where the cottage is supposed to be, and the photo of the cottage was copied from somewhere else.\\n\\nFor [[Finland]], a variant is a foreign agent selling a do-it-yourself trip with booked lodging. The lodgings are indeed there, but they are free-to-use [[Finnish national parks#Sleep|wilderness huts]], where you are expected to tighten up as more people arrive. This causes significant irritation and frustration, between the tourists who booked the huts for themselves, perhaps even expecting some service, and other hikers who expect everybody to play by totally different rules.\\n\\nPayments by bank wire are very difficult to reverse. Credit card rules may require that you dispute fraudulent charges within one or two months. If you lose money to an advance fee scam many months before your journey, your bank or your credit card issuer may not be obligated to help you get your money back.\\n\\n===Amenity fees===\\n[[File:Las Vegas Strip at night, 2012.jpg|thumb|\\\"Resort fees\\\" are common in cities such as [[Las Vegas]]]]\\n\\nYour hotel should provide a list of amenities and should indicate, before booking, whether they are included with a room\\u2019s rate. Some hotels charge customers additional fees for certain amenities, even if guests do not use them. Especially at large hotels, Wi-Fi access may be advertised as \\u201cfree,\\u201d but the free service is limited to speeds that are too low for many modern web sites and apps, and a paid option makes the Wi-Fi faster. The \\u201cresort fee,\\u201d which can double the cost of a cheap-sounding hotel room in Las Vegas, includes access to a hotel\\u2019s fitness room, pool, business center, and other common areas. Since 2017, Marriott adds similar \\u201cDaily Destination Fees\\u201d to bills at many of its properties, especially those in urban centers, and guests cannot typically opt out of them. Resort or destination fees should be disclosed when you make your reservation, although you may be expected to pay them at the hotel rather than in advance. Separating these charges makes a hotel look less expensive when guests shop for the lowest-priced room.\\n\\nHoteliers are infamous for padding invoices with \\\"incidentals\\\", hidden charges for anything from [[telephone service|telephone calls]] at inflated prices, to high charges for parking, to overpriced pay-per-view television programming, to bottles of water that a na\\u00efve traveller assumes to be free. It is common for hotels to charge high fees when guests call any phone numbers, even toll-free numbers. Some venues have illegally jammed [[mobile telephone]] data connections to force guests to use their overpriced services.\\n\\nServices ordered from external vendors through the hotel desk, such as car rental, can be from less reputable vendors that overcharge the customer or that practice bait-and-switch. A hotel's concierge can help you if you are unfamiliar with the local language, customs, and businesses, although they may make recommendations on the basis of incentives that local businesses provide rather than based on quality.\\n\\n===Claims of damage===\\nAt check-in, you are required to provide a credit card, and you sign a contract that you can be held accountable for any damages. After you check out, you find your card has been heftily billed by the hotel. You contact your credit card company to dispute this, but the hotel responds by sending the credit card company a picture of supposed damage, and a supposed bill from a contractor to repair it. In some cases, you don\\u2019t notice the charges until after the window to open a dispute has closed, or your credit card issuer will not entertain disputes concerning vendors in a foreign country.\\n\\nAnother variant is for the hotelier to accuse travellers of stealing towels or other small items; instead of making the accusation to the client's face, the charge is silently added to the credit card bill. When the traveller disputes it, the hotel backs off, only to try the same scam against subsequent travellers.\\n\\n===Disposal of possessions===\\nYou return to your motel for the final night of your stay, only to find the key will not work. You go to the office, and you've been informed you paid for one less night. You are also told the management cleaned out the room and disposed of your possessions you left behind. Management, in reality, has kept your possessions and is planning to sell those which are valuable, all while you are angry and helpless.\\n\\n===Early or no-reservation arrivals===\\nIf you arrive very early in the morning at your hotel, well before check-in time, you will have to wait until check-in, or the hotel will rent you a very expensive room for the night. If you intend to arrive well before check-in, particularly before sunrise on that day, contact your hotel before you book so that you understand how many nights you should reserve.\\n\\nA guest without a reservation might be charged the full \\\"rack rate,\\\" similar to the suggested retail price for goods, from which retailers \\\"mark down\\\" to the price most customers pay. If you have a smartphone or laptop with Internet access, check whether the price you're being quoted at the front desk is higher than the price on the inn's website. If it is, demand a better rate.\\n\\n===Fake booking site===\\nOnline booking sites have become a common method of reserving hotels these days. Lesser-known sites will advertise the same hotels at a lower price, and upon making the reservation, will take your money and give you a confirmation number. Upon arrival, the hotel will tell you they do not have a reservation for you, and they do not recognize the booking agency you used. Your reservation will not be honored, and your money is lost.\\n\\nCommon red flags are that you have never heard of the company before and that prices seem unusually low for the property. To avoid these scams, only book through the sites of reputable booking companies or with the property directly. Type the booking company's web address directly into the browser address bar rather than following a link from another site. If you really want to be sure that your on-line reservation is valid, call or e-mail your hotel a few days before you arrive.\\n\\nAnother variant is the hidden middleman, where you think that you've contacted the hotel but you're actually talking to a reseller who is taking a commission for themselves. For instance, +1-800-HOLIDAY (465-4329) is a major hotel chain; +1-800-H0LIDAY (405-4329) is not the hotel chain but an unaffiliated reseller. The reservations created are real, either in the original hotel or a direct competitor, but dealing with a typosquatter instead of someone advertising for business by legit and conventional means might not get the best available rate as it's one more middleman to pay.\\n\\n===Higher rates in fine print===\\nA lodging establishment will advertise a low rate in large print, but the rate has strings attached. It may, for example, be a \\\"senior rate\\\" available only to people who are over a certain age, or may be reserved for repeat guests or other who belong to some group defined by the establishment. The words \\\"per person, double occupancy\\\" slipped into the fine print mean that the actual price for one room is double what appears in the large-print advertising copy. Taxes and fees may be excluded from the advertised rate; in some cities, these can add 50% or more to your up-front cost.\\n\\nLow rates may also be limited to very specific circumstances or quantities. An inexpensive-seeming motel may have only one room rented for their base price, for example, or the base price is only available on Wednesday nights in the dead of winter.\\n\\nHotels may also book guests at a low price, then tell guests upon arrival that their room is not available and that they must pay more for a higher-priced room if they want to stay at the property. A more subtle bait-and-switch is to claim that the room the traveller has requested is not cleaned or ready yet, then offer to switch them to a different class of room at a higher price, a form of upselling. A traveller who declines the extra expense, especially if they arrived early, is left waiting for hours for the desired room.\\n\\n===Home stay networks===\\n\\n[[File:Casa de Jaime Camil con fondo de la Bahia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Many people find hospitality exchange a practical form of accommodation for instance at a beach destination]]\\nThe Internet has fueled massive growth in [[hospitality exchange]] and [[vacation rentals]] by allowing homeowners to list rooms or entire apartments for rent with relative ease. These can be an excellent money saver if used cautiously and honestly, but there are risks and pitfalls both for the voyager and the home owner.\\n\\nScammers steal login information of legitimate users and take over their profiles, giving the appearance of an established user with positive feedback. They then list a home for rent, responding to inquiries by directing users to a third-party payment portal. Messages in response to your inquiry on airbnb.com send you to a bogus web site made to look like Airbnb. If you make a payment outside the system provided by the real home stay site, the scammer has your cash, and the official site cannot help you get your money back.\\n\\n===Luggage or documents held hostage===\\nA voyager notes currency, wedding rings or other valuables missing from the in-room safe and complains to management. The resort conducts an \\\"investigation\\\" in which they search the victim's belongings (the missing items, predictably, are not found there) and then tells them to leave everything in the room, including passports. The client is moved to another part of the resort, then accused of fabricating the original theft complaint and told they could move back to the room to get their belongings only if the original theft report is withdrawn.<!-- http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-family-dream-vacation-cuba-turns-to-nightmare-1.3435425 -->\\n\\n===Refund refusal===\\nYou check into a low quality hotel and find you are unhappy with the conditions, as anyone would be. You promptly return to the office, asking for a refund. But the management refuses you the refund, and gives you the option either to stay there and tough it out, or to leave and lose your money.\\n\\nThis is considered standard practice, rather than a scam, in a number of countries, particularly with regards to walk-in (no reservation) guests. You should always ask to see the room before deciding whether or not to stay at a hotel. Plenty of bad motels run slick adverts or websites which take an outdated or very carefully selective view of a property. You are also more likely to end up with a nicer room if you check first.\\n\\n===Reputational management===\\nOnline reviews are invaluable to the traveller; a hotel with a string of dissatisfied travellers will be exposed by irate reviewers long before locals at the destination (who don't stay in the hotel) notice a new owner has let a once-respectable venue deteriorate into a transient lodger's nightmare. Unfortunately, like any powerful tool, the review website is prone to manipulation and abuse.\\n\\nSome hoteliers have written positive reviews for themselves and negative reviews for their competitors, or they have hired professionals for this purpose. Some review sites offer marketing packages where, for a fee, businesses can promote positive reviews to show up first, relegating critical reviews to a lower position. In extreme circumstances, hotel operators have threatened legal action against authors of negative reviews, pressuring the authors or the sites on which these reviews were published. To avoid this manipulation, try to view reviews in chronological order starting with the newest. Read reviews carefully: if a lot of 5-star reviews are terse and repetitive, they may have been inserted to counteract more detailed and specific critical reviews.\\n\\nMany businesses encourage guests to leave positive reviews on review sites; some offer a financial incentive to do so. In a few instances, innkeepers slip conditions into the fine print claiming that the traveller \\\"agrees\\\" to pay some inflated penalty if they (or, for wedding parties, anyone in the group) leaves a negative review. When these practices are exposed, they typically do more damage to the hotel's reputation.\\n\\n===Water bottles in room===\\nHotels often leave bottles of water in your room or minibar.  Some hotels offer these for free, while others charge outrageous prices for them, even if the local tap water is perfectly drinkable.  [[Las Vegas]], where hotels often charge over $20 per bottle, is particularly notorious for this.  Double-check pricing when in doubt, check if the tap water is OK, and buy your own bottles elsewhere if it's not.\\n\\nAs a countermeasure, when you make your reservation, you may request that your hotel not stock your room's minibar. Not all hotels will honour (or even acknowledge) this request.\\n\\n==Employment and charity scams==\\n{{seealso|Volunteer_travel#Be_wary{{!}}Volunteer travel \\u00a7 Be wary}}\\n{{seealso|Working_abroad#Stay_safe{{!}}Working abroad \\u00a7 Stay safe}}\\n\\n[[Working abroad]], engaging in [[volunteer travel]] or maybe [[teaching English]] in some faraway land can be a rewarding way to experience another culture. But be careful, as the field is littered with a few outright scams, widespread exploitative conditions, and numerous pitfalls. There are few resources available for travellers who are harmed while working abroad.\\n\\nSome offers are advance fee scams or forms that harvest your data for identity theft purposes. The supposed prospective employer may want payment up front for your visa, transport, lawyers, training, uniforms, commercial goods for resale or any of a number of items before you can start work. Once you arrive, the promised job isn't as advertised (or doesn't exist at all) and your money is gone.\\n\\nSome easy-sounding courier jobs turn a traveller into a \\\"mule\\\", a job that involves a person transporting restricted items (money, drugs, documents, antique, whatever) from one country to another. Money mules are used by criminals to launder the proceeds from illegal activities. Even if a mule is ignorant of the true nature, source or destination of what they carry, they are still responsible for it, with possibly severe consequences, serious hassle even if charges are dropped and the death penalty for drug trafficking in some countries. '''Do not transport items for strangers when you travel.''' If somebody asks you open a bank account in your name for their use, never agree to that, as they are likely to use the bank account to launder their proceeds from criminal activity, and you will be liable for criminal penalties if caught.\\n\\nSome employers abuse the visa system or employment law to inflict conditions on voyagers that local workers would never tolerate. They may take advantage of work visas which are tied to one employer, overcharge employees for housing or other expenses, promise a reasonable wage per hour but schedule too few hours to pay for your expenses, hold your passport or other documents hostage, or ask you to work illegally under the wrong visa. Long hours, low wages (or outright wage theft), unsafe working conditions, and even physical or sexual harassment can go unpunished, as the worker who complains can be deported after their employer revokes their visa, and then may not be able to raise charges or act as witness. In extreme cases, employment schemes are ''bait-and-switch'' or even ''human trafficking'' schemes, where the victim is offered a job in a restaurant or hotel abroad, only to find the advertised position doesn't exist, the recruiters are part of an organised crime gang and the prospective foreign worker is forced into prostitution or other forms of slavery.\\n\\nIf you intend to work or volunteer while travelling internationally, read your destination's visa policies carefully. In some countries, '''volunteers may need work visas''' just like professional employees do. If an organization offers you free room and board in exchange for your labour, immigration officials may consider that to be paid employment, requiring a work visa. Avoiding proper procedure makes you vulnerable \\u2013 complaining about unreasonable demands, unpaid wages or substandard accommodation is difficult if your status is illegal.\\n\\nTo avoid these scams, '''do your research''' before accepting a job, putting in any money, or sharing any sensitive information. Ask to talk to current employees, and look the company up online. If you can't find third-party sources indicating it's reputable, steer clear. It's best to find job listings from a source that vets the companies that it allows to advertise.\\n\\nA full list of pitfalls is beyond the scope of this article; see [[Working abroad]] and [[Volunteer travel]] for more information, and if in doubt, obtain specialised advice before considering travel abroad to work or volunteer.\\n\\n==Dating scams==\\n\\nDating and romance scams are possible for any combination of genders and in any location. In the U.S., in 2019, more dollars were lost to romance scams than to any other category of fraud.<!-- https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/well/elderly-romance-scam.html -->\\n\\n===Online===\\n\\t\\nIt is fairly common for travellers to use dating sites/apps to meet locals of whatever gender, age group and type they are interested in. Most of the people on such sites are genuine and some are very nice indeed. Some apps, especially those which are not generally popular with locals in the destination country, attract scammers as well. \\n\\t\\nDo not trust what you see online; you do not actually know if a person is who they say they are until you meet them in real life, and sometimes not even then. Scammers reuse photos from other profiles or from online sources; try a reverse image search to see if a profile photo is used elsewhere. If you meet, have the first date in a public, safe place, with other people around (such as your friends or random caf\\u00e9 client\\u00e8le).\\n\\nDo not send money to someone you have not met. They may be in another part of the country, or even in a different country, and want you to send the fare and perhaps some money for expenses so they can join you. They may pocket the cash, then ask for more, citing new complications. They may have a sob story, such as they lost their job or that a relative is sick, and they may ask the presumably wealthy traveller for assistance.\\n\\nSome things should make you a bit suspicious:\\n* They seem to be rushing things, e.g. proclaiming \\\"I love you\\\", or calling you \\\"baby\\\" or \\\"honey\\\" before you have even met. This might just be because they are non-native speakers of your language and their culture is different.\\n* They push too hard or too soon for marriage or immigration to your country.\\n* They do not talk a lot about themselves (no introduction, little information on their background, and so on).\\n* They are not willing or hesitant to meet you in person. \\n\\t\\nBeware of sharing too much personal information with people you barely even know. Be especially cautious about sending sexy photos and videos; these can be saved and used for blackmail or extortion. There are reports of quite a few men (usually Western) being caught by this when a woman met online (usually in a low-income country) suggests some play on the webcam; she then has a video of him naked or masturbating, and threatens to send it to all his Facebook friends unless she is paid not to. In another variant, a man asks a younger woman for topless photos, then tries to blackmail her into sex; this has led to several suicides.\\n\\nAll of the hazards associated with other dating scams and [[#Sex workers|prostitution]] may also apply to people you meet online.\\n\\n=== Dine and dash scam ===\\n\\nYour date will invite you to a restaurant. Once you are there, they will order the most expensive items on the menu. After a while, they will come up with some excuse (urgent phone call, need to pick up something from my car, etc.) and say that they need to go somewhere urgently. After they leave, they will never come back and you will end up being liable to the restaurateur.\\n\\n===Long cons===\\n\\nA scammer who went on a date with a traveller (victim) professes to fall in love with the traveller. The scammer leads the victim to believe that they are interested in moving to the victim's home country, but first, they need money to settle their affairs or to cover travel expenses. The scammer may ask the victim to meet their \\\"family\\\", a group of their associates, who also ask the victim for money to cover their expenses. The scammer may claim not to own luggage, not to hold a passport, or not to have suitable clothing for the victim's home country, so they ask the victim to transfer money to cover these expenses. Long cons can last for months or years, and can cost thousands or even millions of dollars. Some victims have been duped into buying properties at grossly inflated prices, for example, unaware of the costs of real estate or the procedures for buying homes in the scammer's market.\\n\\n===Professional daters===\\n\\n'''Professional daters''', or '''pro-daters''', are scammers who go on dates with the primary goal of getting their victims to spend as much money as possible. Pro-daters may collaborate with bars, clubs, or restaurants that charge the victim inflated prices, then share in the proceeds. If there is a language barrier between the pro-dater and the victim, which can be addressed in text chat using mobile translation technology, an associate may join the couple in person to act as a translator. The victim is expected to pay for all parties' expenses. Pro-daters were notorious for operating in [[Ukraine]] prior to the 2022 Russian invasion.<!-- https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57358241 -->\\n\\nTravellers can encounter pro-daters by visiting bars that are known to be popular with tourists or by using dating apps while they are on vacation in an unfamiliar country. These scammers are not genuinely interested in a romantic relationship, and indeed may already be in such a relationship themselves, but instead prioritize obtaining money and valuable goods from suggestible travellers.\\n\\nIf a person you've just met is asking you to go to a particular bar or restaurant, perhaps with one of their friends as a translator, look that place up on sites such as Tripadvisor. Read reviews to see if other tourists have been swindled by pro-daters there. Try suggesting an alternate location; if your companion insists on a particular place, this may be a sign that they are working with that establishment to defraud tourists.\\n\\n=== Sanky-panky scam ===\\nA '''sanky-panky''' is a local who tries to seduce the presumably wealthy foreign traveller by preying on emotional or romantic vulnerability. The term is used mainly in the Caribbean region, but the phenomenon is common elsewhere as well. Overweight or over-40 people are those most often targeted, although anybody can get scammed. Instead of outright soliciting money for sex, the scammer creates a pseudo-relationship which can be continued when the guest returns home. They ask for money wire transfers using elaborate stories of need or seek a marriage visa to the tourist's native country; once they have what they want, the wealthy foreigner is jilted.\\n\\nBecause these operators repeatedly perpetrate the same scam on multiple foreign visitors and may have other lovers as well, there is a significant health risk associated with a sexual relationship with a sanky-panky.\\n\\n=== Arranged marriages ===\\nIn some countries, notably including [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Pakistan]], marriages are often arranged, even for those who have emigrated or never lived there themselves. You may trust your family's judgement better than yours, but if you want to choose yourself, you may be tricked into such an arranged marriage.\\n\\nYour family may ask you to come on a short trip to your home country. What was supposed to be a short holiday results in you getting strong-armed into marital arrangements against your will. Your relatives may subject you to threats, intimidation, and violence, as means to make you feel you have no choice but to accept the marriage. In ''some'' cases, they have been arranged for purposes other than your happiness and well-being; your spouse and their family may treat you horribly, may try to take advantage of your financial situation, and so on. Even in the common case that your parents did want to find the right spouse for you, they might have thought more about your economic needs than about your feelings.\\n\\nInvoluntary marriages are illegal in many countries, and no parents and no future spouse want a scandal at the wedding. Is there still some chance to get out of this without anybody losing face? At the same time, be aware that your chances to escape and your safety may be at risk. Do you have somebody you can talk to confidentially and whom you can completely trust?\\n\\nIf you think that the marriage may be acceptable after all, do a comprehensive background check on the person you are being arranged to marry. They may be chosen for their status rather than their potential to be a loved spouse. If you feel there's something off about someone, trust your gut. \\n\\nConsider calling the police or your embassy if you feel threatened. Always maintain possession of your valuable documents, particularly your passport. Do your best not to let your family members get their hands on them; otherwise, leaving the country on your own will get much more difficult.\\n\\nThe British government provides [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/forced-marriage guidance about forced marriage]. Local phone numbers are available in the most affected countries.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Crime]] and [[theft]]\\n* [[Authority trouble]]\\n* [[Internet access]], including tips about how to keep your devices secure while traveling\\n\\n{{PartOfTopic|Stay safe}}\\n{{guidetopic}}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.2354187807912583, "reason": "The actual output contradicts the expected output by identifying Detroit instead of Las Vegas.

Its global reach allows people from all over the world to attend its races. Attending a race can be an adventure in itself, and a race-goer can expect to experience a new country and culture and interact with people from all around the world. Formula One visits roughly 20 countries on every continent except Africa.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nThe locations of Formula One racing remain fairly static throughout the year, with only the dates of the races subject to year on year changes. More countries have been hosting a Grand Prix, especially in Asia. Recent additions include circuits in [[Azerbaijan]], the [[Middle East]], [[Singapore]], the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]].\\n\\n===Weekend structure===\\nFormula One events take place over three days, referred to as 'the weekend', starting with practice sessions on Friday, qualifying on Saturday, and culminating with the race on Sunday. Monaco is normally the only exception to this, where the practice sessions are by tradition held one day earlier on the Thursday, leaving the Friday free. (In 2024, the Bahrain and Saudi Arabia races were rescheduled to Saturday to avoid conflicts with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.) The routine below outlines a normal non-sprint weekend:\\n\\n*'''Friday''' (Thursday in Monaco) kicks off the weekend with two 1-hour Free Practice sessions: one in the morning (FP1) and one in the early afternoon (FP2). Qualifying for some supporting championships may also occur in between or after the sessions.\\n*'''Saturday''' features the third and final Free Practice session in the morning (FP3) before the official qualifying session, which most often begins at 1PM local time. The qualifying lasts 60 minutes, after which support championships go back on track with either qualifying sessions or races depending on the category.\\n*'''Sunday''' is the busiest day of the weekend, comprising entirely of races. Support championship races will bookend the day, with the Formula One race beginning anywhere between 13:00 and 15:00 local time, depending on location (the Australian and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix begin late afternoon, the Singapore Grand Prix at 20:00). A Formula One race can last up to 2 hours of running time or 3 hours from race start (whichever comes first; red flag stops the running time), but barring delays or wet weather 70-90 minute races are expected.\\nAs of 2021, a new format that includes the Sprint has been introduced at some tracks. The routine below outlines a sprint weekend:\\n\\n*'''Friday''' kicks off the weekend with the only Free Practice session in the morning (FP1). Teams will make their best efforts to utilize the limited practice before Qualifying at the FP2 timeslot.\\n*'''Saturday''' is the Sprint day, kicked off with a Sprint Shootout (read: shortened Qualifying) at the FP3 timeslot, followed by a 100-km Sprint Race that lasts roughly a third of the main race on Sunday. Offers limited points for the Top 8 and pitstops are optional, however results from the Sprint Race do not affect the main race.\\n*'''Sunday''' works the same way as a normal non-sprint weekend.\\n\\n===Support races===\\nWith only six hours of action over three days, the crowd can get restless when the Formula One cars aren't racing around the track. However, the Formula One championship is joined by many other supporting championships over the weekend to keep the track alive. The races may be shorter and the cars may be slower, but don't discount the excitement (and carnage) they may bring.\\n*'''Formula 2 (F2)''' is the feeder series to F1 and is present at most European and Middle Eastern races. Formula 2 cars look like smaller versions of F1 cars and their drivers are eager to cut their teeth into world-class racing, as finishing well in this series helps to acquire the prestige and Super License points necessary to make it to F1. Formula 2 features 30-minute practice and qualifying sessions on Friday and Saturday respectively, and one race each on Saturday and Sunday. The series has a reputation of delivering future racing stars, and several of the current crop of F1 drivers, such as Lewis Hamilton, Lando Norris, Alexander Albon, and Charles Leclerc were once Formula 2 drivers.\\n*'''Formula 3 (F3)''' is a rung down from Formula 2, with young drivers getting their first taste of international racing. The series is present at most European races. Like Formula 2, there are 30-minute practice and qualifying sessions on the Friday and Saturday before two races on the Saturday and Sunday. While successful F3 drivers typically graduate to F2, a notable exception is current F1 series champion Max Verstappen, who went directly from F3 to F1.\\n*'''Porsche Supercup''' is a sports car series where all drivers compete in identical Porsche 911 GT3 Cup cars. Most current Porsche factory drivers have competed in Porsche Supercup.\\n\\n==Grand Prix locations==\\n===Americas===\\n====[[Canada]]====\\n[[File:Montreal F1.jpg|thumb|The hairpin (''L'Epingle'') at the ''Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve'' offers great viewing opportunities]]\\n'''Canadian Grand Prix''' - ''Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, [[Montr\\u00e9al]]''\\n*'''Date''': mid-June\\n*[http://www.circuitgillesvilleneuve.ca/billets/your-weekend-at-the-grand-prix-2014 '''Tickets'''] (2014): General Admission: $45.45 (F), $70.50 (Sa), $95.75 (Su), $126.00 (weekend); Grandstand: $267.50-560.00; 1 child under 11 per ticket-holding adult: Free\\n*Certainly one of the best venues on the calendar, the ''Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve'' often produces some of the best racing of the season.

Camping is allowed on site with a permit. Traffic into the venue can be notoriously heavy, not only for cars but also for helicopters, with the circuit becoming the busiest heliport in Europe on race day. Take precautions to deal with the unpredictable British summer weather. Despite having a modern layout and expensive ticket prices, the circuit still retains an old-fashioned vibe, and is still very much an event for the fans.\\n*'''Contact''': +44 844 3750 740\\n\\n===Oceania===\\n====[[Australia]]====\\n'''Australian Grand Prix''' - ''[http://www.grandprix.com.au/ Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit], Albert Park, [[Melbourne]]''\\n*'''Date''': mid-March\\n*[https://www.grandprix.com.au/gpadvantage '''Tickets''']{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}: Grandstand: Adult: $320-565 (4 days)\\n*The Australian Grand Prix takes place at the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit in Albert Park, which is normally a public park the rest of the year. Plenty of good viewing spots and compared to many tracks are quite close to the circuit's edge. General entry is good value with the most popular spot being Brocky's Hill at the back part of the circuit. It is advisable to take a picnic rug or foldable chair if choosing to sit there.\\n*'''Contact''': \\n\\n==Get in==\\n===Tickets===\\nEntry to a circuit requires a ticket. Tickets can be bought for the whole weekend (all three days) or for one specific day (they get more expensive as the weekend goes along). There are generally two types on sale:\\n*'''General admission''' tickets are the cheapest and most easily available, and they do not restrict the ticket-holder to a particular section of the track. Many circuits have viewing banks that general admission ticket-holders can use, although these fill up very quickly so get there early for a good spot. If the viewing areas are full then there are many parts where standing is available. These tickets do not give the comfort of grandstand tickets, so make sure adequate protection from the elements is brought along. The ground may be uneven or wet underfoot so bring suitable footwear and something to sit on.\\n*'''Grandstand''' tickets give the best view of a particular section of the track and often have a large screen in view so none of the action is missed. Ticket prices are scaled, with the most expensive stands giving the most protection from the elements along with the best view. Tickets for grandstands are most commonly booked in advance so the buyer can choose a specific seat, although a few may be available on entry. There may be a few grandstands at some circuits that have no seat allocation, although these don't always give the best view.\\n\\n===Traffic===\\n====By car====\\nFormula One Grands Prix are popular events, so preparations should be made for heavy traffic. If arriving by car, Fridays are often the quietest day, but don't expect to just sail through. Traffic queues on the weekend can be ridiculously long, and unless you are a dedicated soul arriving before sunrise expect to be waiting upwards of half an hour. The same can be said for leaving. A vast majority of the crowd tends to try and leave at the same time, so unless you wish to leave early (and miss some racing) or wait until late in the evening (when there is no racing going on) be prepared for more waiting. The parking areas tend to be extremely large so make a note of anything that can make identifying where you've parked easier. No one wants to be searching for their car at the end of a tiring day.\\n\\n====By shuttlebus====\\nSome circuits may offer a shuttlebus service, designed to alleviate traffic problems. Cars are parked some way from the track and shuttlebuses run at frequent times to the track in their own designated lane, so this can make entry a much quicker process.\\n\\n====By helicopter====\\nArriving by helicopter is the most stylish way for the fan to enter, if you are lucky enough to be a VIP. Most tracks have some kind of heliport, if not a purpose-built one then a field within the circuit perimeter is used. All the worries associated with queueing and waiting are largely foregone, and helicopter is surely the most stress-free way of getting in.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nWalking is generally the best option (and sometimes the only option) for getting from one area to another. Circuit maps are printed within official programs and on boards dotted around the track. If you do not have a print version of the circuit map consider taking a picture of one of the boards with your phone or camera. Bridges and service tunnels connect the interior of the circuit with the exterior.\\n\\n==Buy==\\nThere will be many stalls situated just outside the viewing areas selling all kinds of F1 and motorsport memorabilia. Stock typically includes official team/driver merchandise and clothing; pictures and paintings; branded gear such as umbrellas, binoculars and flags; DVDs and other media; and collectible racing car models. Official programs will also be on sale. Be prepared to pay high prices (remember you're mainly paying for the brand), but they can make excellent souvenirs from the event and the gear can be used again for future events. These can usually be purchased online for cheaper prior to the weekend.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\nWith these tracks often located away from city centers, hotels near many of the circuits can sell out up to a year in advance, so if you are intending on staying nearby book early. Some venues, such as Silverstone, allow camping on fields adjacent to the circuit. You will probably need to book a camping ticket to take advantage of this, and these too usually sell out fast so book early if you want to take this option.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nDespite the high visibility of the 'motorsport is dangerous' notices Formula One has quite a good spectator safety record. However, no matter how safe a restricted part of the track may seem you should not venture onto these areas as they can be quite dangerous. Previous spectator fatalities at Formula One races have been caused by the spectators in question being on a restricted part of the track. Sticking to the proper areas drastically reduces the chances of being hurt in an accident. Moving vehicles operate in the paddock areas and along service roads, so keep your eyes and ears open. If someone is hurt, there are medical tents with trained staff at various points around the track; these are marked clearly on circuit diagram boards.\\n\\nThe following general precautions should also be taken:\\n*'''Earplugs''' are highly recommended especially for young children and those going for the first time. Formula One cars are ear-damagingly loud and having 20 cars over a sustained period of 90 minutes can cause harm. Earplugs will probably be available at the track and some circuits offer basic versions for free. If you are intending on taking a radio to listen to the on-track commentary use a pair on in-ear monitors that can double as earplugs.\\n*'''[[Sun protection]]''' is advised as many races take place in the summer with only grandstand seats getting any meaningful shade. Wide-brimmed caps are handy, and sunglasses are optional.\\n*'''Waterproof clothing''' is a necessity especially for those not in sheltered areas. Even if the forecast is dry, some areas (for example Spa-Francorchamps) may experience large changes in conditions over a small area. Take a strong umbrella to cope with windy weather, otherwise bring a waterproof coat.\\n\\n{{PartOfTopic|Spectator sports}}\\n\\n{{usabletopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Milan West banner Last supper.jpg|caption=Last Supper painting in the Santa Maria delle Grazie church|unesco=yes}}\\n\\n'''Western [[Milan]]''' is the part of the city that encompasses its only [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], which includes a famous painting.

Nestled around two of these peaks is San Luis Obispo (\\\"SLO\\\", \\\"slow\\\", or \\\"San Luis\\\" to locals), a small college town that also is one of California's oldest communities. San Luis and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing; outstanding natural beauty; a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission; a small but thriving art gallery scene; and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.\\n\\n===Getting Oriented===\\nSan Luis Obispo is bounded by the imposing line of Cuesta Ridge to the northeast, the Irish Hills to the southwest, dramatic Bishop Peak to the northwest and Islay Hill to the southeast. The town clusters around the feet of the 1,000-foot (300-meter) Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white \\\"M\\\" (for Mission High School). Both locals and visitors frequently refer to Cerro San Luis as \\\"Madonna Mountain\\\" and a common misconception is that the \\\"M\\\" represents the surname \\\"Madonna;\\\" the famous Madonna Inn sits at the foot of the mountain and the city of San Luis Obispo negotiated public access to the peak with the Madonna family. Cal Poly sits hard against Cuesta Ridge (with its big white \\\"P\\\") and the downtown area runs from Cerro San Luis roughly toward campus around two parallel streets, Higuera and Monterey. Most restaurants, bars and shops are located on Higuera Street, nearer the Mission and Cerro San Luis; hotels are mostly located on Monterey Street, nearer the university but still within a mile (2 km) of the central downtown. A few restaurants are located in the charming Railroad District, about 5 blocks east of Higuera via Santa Rosa Street, near the train station and youth hostel.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Visitors Center | alt= | url=http://visitslo.com/ | email=visitorcenter@slochamber.org\\n| address=895 Monterey St. | lat= | long= | directions=in the same building as the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, on the corner of Morro and Monterey Streets in the heart of downtown\\n| phone=+1 805 781-2777 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Su-W 10AM-5PM; Th-Sa 10AM-7PM | price=\\n| content=The Visitor Center offers San Luis Obispo city maps, visitor guides, books about San Luis Obispo, and San Luis Obispo souvenirs.

Trails range from casual ambles along the bluffs to the steep climbs up Valencia and Oats Peaks. Oats is the longer hike (about 5.5 miles / 9 km) but more rewarding, as it offers views of Valencia against the Pacific, as well as northward and eastward to the Nine Sisters and Cuesta Ridge; the trail also is less steep. A terrific nine-mile (14-km) loop can be made by continuing over the summit to the Coon Creek trail, then crossing back in front of the range along Rattlesnake Flats Trail. Take water!

Public vehicles are not allowed to drive on it, though be alert for university vehicles travelling up and down on occasion and student runners/cyclists.\\n* Kayaks and other outdoor gear can be rented at reasonable prices by students and the public from '''Poly Escapes''' on the Cal Poly campus.

Its central location makes it a popular extended weekend getaway for people from the San Francisco Bay Area and greater Los Angeles area.\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo County's largest city is [[San Luis Obispo]], home to California Polytechnic State University (\\\"Cal Poly\\\"). To the south of San Luis Obispo is the unincorporated community of [[Avila Beach]] and the towns of [[Arroyo Grande]] and Pismo Beach. To the north of San Luis Obispo are [[Morro Bay]] and [[Los Osos]] on the coast, and [[Atascadero]] and [[Paso Robles]] along with the county's fast-growing wine country.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[Image:Neptune Pool, Hearst Castle (5569577705).jpg|thumb|300px|Neptune Pool, Hearst Castle]]\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nHighway 101 is the main north-south highway through the county, traversing the inland portions of the county and providing the fastest route for travelers.

The northern part of the county contains every manner of amenity for travelers, ranging from chain motels to five star resorts, while the southern portion of the county is remote and accessible mainly by the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] or on foot by hikers.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Kings County]]|wikidata=Q156358}} - Located northeast of San Luis Obispo County, rural Kings County is responsible for billions of dollars of annual agricultural production, much of it from the dairy industry.

While the county is heavily populated (with services to match), the Los Padres National Forest dominates the northern part of this county and provides recreational opportunities for those who want to spend time outdoors.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Santa Barbara County]]|wikidata=Q108106}} - San Luis Obispo County's southern neighbor is most famous for the town of [[Santa Barbara]] and is sometimes considered the northern boundary of Southern California. While mountains run through the region, the county is well served by a network of highways, making road trips to the many beautiful wineries a popular activity. The Danish town of [[Solvang]] is a popular destination, and rocket launches can sometimes be viewed near Vandenberg Air Force base, America's west coast spaceport.\\n\\n{{geo|35.38|-120.45|zoom=9}}\\n{{IsPartOf|Central Coast (California)}}\\n{{outlineregion}}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.6673425147572049, "reason": "The actual output correctly identifies Highway 101 as the main highway to San Luis Obispo, which aligns with the expected output.

The '''Southern Lights''' or '''''aurora australis''''' also occur but are not as often observed.\\n\\nTo observers at far-northern latitudes, the Lights are a frequent occurrence, but many who live in more temperate climates have never seen them, even though they are occasionally seen as far south as 35 degrees North latitude. This article will help you improve your chances of seeing the Lights if you journey north.\\n[[File:Aurora Borealis I.jpg|thumb|400px|Northern Lights near [[Troms\\u00f8]], [[Norway]]]]\\nThe aurorae are caused by charged particles ejected from the sun. When these particles reach the earth, they collide with gas molecules in the earth's upper atmosphere, energising them and creating a spectacular multi-coloured light show. Charged particles are affected by magnetic fields, so the Lights occur mainly at far northern or southern latitudes near the Earth's magnetic poles.\\n\\nThe Lights look somewhat similar to a sunset in the sky at night, but appear occasionally in arcs or spirals usually following the earth's magnetic field. They fairly often look like moving curtains of light, high in the sky. They are most often light green in color but often have a hint of pink. Strong eruptions also have violet and white colors. Red northern lights are rare, but are sometimes observed.\\n\\nThe Lights are generally fairly dim, but sometimes bright enough that reading a newspaper on a moonless night is possible. Both brightness and how far from the poles they are visible vary according to three factors: time of year, an 11-year cycle in solar activity, and solar storms. These are discussed in more detail later.\\n\\nLight pollution around cities can mask a dim aurora display. Therefore, areas at least 30 km from cities are preferred for viewing. The trick is to get far enough from cities for good viewing (generally easy, since most northern areas are not heavily populated) ''without'' taking undue risks in a climate that can easily kill you.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Map auroral oval mostly canada.png|thumb|200px|Northern Lights oval, 2007]]\\n\\nContrary to intuition, seeing the Northern Lights isn't just a matter of heading north. The Lights occur mainly in a circular or elliptical band centered on the earth's North ''Magnetic'' Pole, which is not at the same location as the [[North Pole | North ''Geographic'' Pole]].\\n\\nThe exact location of the North Magnetic Pole varies. Until early in this century, the pole was moving slowly (about 10 km/year) north across [[Ellesmere Island]] in the nearly uninhabited far north of [[Canada]]. Since the beginning  of the  21st century, the pole has been moving faster, for reasons scientists are not yet certain of. As of late 2019 it is out in the Arctic Ocean well north of Ellesmere, and moving toward Russia at about 55 km/year. Because of the movement, the advantages of being on the \\\"right side\\\" of the earth are becoming less pronounced, but there is still a slight North American bias in your chance of seeing the Lights.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|thumb|200px|Southern Lights seen from space]]\\n\\nAuroral displays aren't strongest ''at'' the pole; the band of greatest activity is offset from the Magnetic Pole by 20 degrees or so; the magnetic lines of force are curved and the curvature creates the offset. The '''Northern Lights oval''', meaning the area with the highest probability of seeing the Lights, covers most of [[Alaska]], northern parts of [[Canada]], the southern half of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], northern [[Norway]] and the northernmost areas of [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], as well as the western half of the Russian north. There is a similar oval in the South; see the photo.\\n\\nRegions such as the central and southern parts of the [[Nordic countries]], southern Canada, the north-central [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Scotland]] also frequently see Northern Lights, but not as often as directly under the Northern Lights oval. [[Svalbard]] sees Northern Lights less often than Northern Scandinavia, but is a place to observe the fainter Day Northern Lights visible during waking hours in its long [[polar night]]. \\n\\nThat said, the actual latitudes of the Lights vary considerably. In times of high solar activity (more on that later), the Lights may be seen in North America at latitudes as low as 35 degrees North, meaning that all but the southernmost parts of the United States may get a display. The offset of the Pole keeps solar storms from benefiting Europe quite as strongly, but most of the countries of northern Europe will get displays during periods of solar storms.\\n\\n==Planning==\\nThere is no guarantee of seeing the Northern Lights even if you are in the best areas at the best time, and there is some chance in others areas and seasons. However, a bit of planning will radically increase your chances. In short, pick somewhere on or very near the oval and go in winter.\\n\\n===Time of year===\\n[[File:AuroraBuryatia.jpg|thumb|400px|Lights in Scandinavia]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\nDarkness is required. Most Northern Lights locations are at high latitudes, in areas that get the \\\"[[midnight sun]]\\\"; there is no darkness from late April until mid-August, or even longer in far northern locations like [[Svalbard]]. Places within eight degrees of latitude south of the Arctic Circle, such as [[Yellowknife]] in Canada, experience \\\"white nights\\\", with only a few hours of twilight between dusk and dawn, at this time of year. In this period, no Northern Lights can be observed.\\n\\nIn the most intense Northern Lights areas, right on the oval, the lights are sometimes observed in any season but chances are best when it is dark after 6pm, from late September to late March. \\n\\nOn a yearly basis, the Lights are at their peak around the time of the equinoxes, in September and March.  The reasons for this trend aren't fully known, but it's definitely real, not just an artifact of the weather or other viewing conditions. Also, if you are planning to do other activities during the day, this is a good time to visit because you can enjoy twelve hours of daylight and still have a good chance of seeing the aurora at night. Temperatures are also milder than in mid-winter.\\n\\n===Time of day===\\nThe time between 6PM and 1AM is the most intense period of the day. The highest probability within this timespan is between 10 and 11PM. However, this is a guideline, and during the Polar night aurorae can be observed as early as 4PM, and all through the night. The most intense displays last some 5\\u201315 minutes each. In periods of strong activity, one can generally expect flares starting in the early evening, peaking around 10pm, and going on into the early morning hours.\\n\\nEven with good clothing, few travellers can tolerate a long time outdoors in an arctic night and the nights generally get continuously colder from sunset until the morning sun starts to warm things up. Even if there are lights in the early evening, it may be best to set out at 9pm or so (sun time, check your timezone); this gives you a good chance of catching the peak display without being out too long or at the coldest times.\\n\\n===11-year cycle===\\nIn the longer term, auroral displays are correlated with an 11-year cycle in sunspot activity and other perturbations of the sun; the more restless the sun, the more aurorae. However, at the most favorable latitudes, the Lights are still likely to be seen even at solar minimum; it's mainly at lower latitudes that they get scarce during the inactive times. There is a maximum in solar activity around 2024.\\n\\n===Solar storms===\\nIn addition to these more or less regular variations in frequency of the aurora, there are also less predictable, erratic displays resulting from '''solar storms'''.  Some of these, particularly near solar-activity maximum, can lead to visible Northern Lights remarkably far south, if you're in an area with clear, transparent night skies. The largest recorded solar storm took place in 1859; the Lights were bright enough to read a newspaper in [[Boston]] (42\\u00b0N) and visible as far south as Mexico. That storm was powerful enough that telegraphs would work without their normal power source, some caught fire. A similar one would probably destroy most electronics.\\n\\nThe [[#Alerts|Alerts]] section below will help you stay on top of solar activity and prepare for some viewing when a solar storm does occur.\\n\\n===Clear skies===\\nLast but not least, don't forget the '''weather forecast''' &mdash; aurora occur very high up in the atmosphere, and if there are clouds in the way you will not see anything. In Northern Scandinavia, the weather is notably better towards the end of the Northern Lights season (February-March), than in the beginning. The weather is probably the most important success factor in the areas under the Northern Lights oval, where there are visible Northern Lights on up to 80% of all clear nights.\\n\\n==Prepare==\\n\\n===Alerts===\\nIf you have the luxury of being able to travel into aurora-viewing territory on short notice, you can improve your chances of seeing something by being aware of \\\"space weather,\\\" the things going on beyond the earth's atmosphere as a result of solar activity.\\n[[File:Aurora australis ISS 20120715.jpg|thumb|400px|Southern Lights seen from the International Space Station, with the Canadarm robotic arm in the foreground]]\\nA good site for space weather information is operated by the (US) [http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] (NOAA). Measurements aboard the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite are used for plotting maps of current extent and position of the auroral oval around both poles; see their [https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast forecast] which predicts intensity and geographical location of the auroral oval based on current solar wind conditions and interplanetary magnetic field virtually in real time. The maps also show the observation limits of current aurorae. The commercial site [http://www.spaceweather.com/ Space Weather] presents much of the same information in digested, more accessible form.\\n\\nThe University of Alaska Fairbanks maintains an [http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast Aurora Alert] website. For Finland, the Finnish Meteorological Institute has an [http://aurorasnow.fmi.fi/public_service/ activity forecast] and current data about magnetic activity. The Icelandic MET office provides a [http://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/ lights forecast] for Iceland including cloud cover prediction.\\n\\nActivity is mainly predicted from the readings taken by the NASA Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellites, which give a one-hour warning. Solar wind activity is characterized by three principal figures: the north-south component of the magnetic field (Bz), speed and density. When Bz is negative (southward), solar wind particles are best able to enter the atmosphere and give rise to aurorae. At high velocities, auroral activity may occur despite a moderately negative Bz. In geomagnetic storms, Bz fluctuates rapidly. Overall geomagnetic activity is characterized by the planetary K-index (Kp), for which predictions are issued. A Kp of 5 or higher occurs in storms and generally makes auroral viewing possible well South of the oval in the northern parts of Europe and the [[United States of America|continental U.S.]]\\n\\nLonger-term estimates can be made by observation of the Sun for bursts. However, the physical models are poorly developed, partly because only two satellites, ACE and DSCOVR, observe the solar wind before it hits the Earth, and the predictions are rather unreliable. The approximate day can be predicted, but whether the burst hits the Earth face-on and exactly when and at what force remains unknown. \\\"Nowcasting\\\" on the ground is done by measuring magnetic field fluctuations, and there are webcams pointed at the sky for directly seeing the aurorae. The NASA Polar and Environmental Satellites (POES) directly measure the extent of the auroral oval, but the satellites pass the pole about 14 times a day and thus the picture can be couple of hours old.\\n\\nIf a major solar storm develops that is forecast to have a good chance of producing Northern (and Southern) Lights, your time to respond will be measured in hours to a few days, rather than either minutes or weeks. The particles that create the aurora move much more slowly than light, so a storm can be observed well before the particles it produces reach Earth, but the time difference is not enormous. The forecasts will usually include some indication of how far from the magnetic poles the activity is expected to extend.  For purposes of travel planning, it's a good idea to plan conservatively and go to a locale somewhat closer to the pole than the predicted maximum extent of the aurora; things don't always work out as forecast, and the Lights may be relatively weak and/or confined to the northern horizon if you're at the southern edge of the activity, either limitation possibly creating difficulties for you in viewing owing to light pollution.\\n\\n===Clothing===\\n[[File:St\\u00f8rmer and Birkeland Alta 1910.jpg|thumb|400px|Freezing photographers, Norway, 1910]]\\nBecause aurorae are usually visible at night in the colder months of the year, the observers tend to spend long hours in cold darkness. It is essential to  dress adequately to minimize the unpleasant side of the auroral experience, and almost impossible to dress too warmly.\\n\\nIn any area that gets severe winters, winter clothing will be widely available, but specialist shops catering to [[Skiing|skiers]], [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] or [[Wilderness backpacking|wilderness backpackers]] generally offer the best choice. Further south, these specialists may be the only places with winter equipment.\\n\\nIn remote northern locations where food, fuel and equipment have to be shipped in, ''prices on more-or-less everything can be very high''. Major northern cities tend to have better prices than more isolated areas, but still higher than in areas further south. Most travellers should buy much of their equipment before setting out; this gives more time for shopping, saves money, and avoids arriving in summer clothing when it is seriously cold outside.\\n\\nSome travellers should plan an extra stop for shopping; for example, going from Miami (where good winter gear is likely to be hard to find) to view the Lights in [[Churchill]] (where it is likely to be expensive and selection limited), one might stop in [[Chicago]], [[Toronto]] or [[Winnipeg]] to outfit oneself.\\n\\nFor specific information on winter clothing, see [[Cold weather#Clothing|Cold weather]]. Remember that you will have to use your fingers, so a combination of gloves and mittens can be useful.\\n\\n===Photography===\\n\\nTaking good pictures of the Northern Lights is '''very difficult''', since they're fast-moving, often faint and against a pitch-dark background, all of which befuddles consumer point-and-shoot cameras. Almost any [[Travel photography/Full systems|interchangeable lens camera]] can handle the job, given the right lens, but the typical \\\"kit lens\\\" sold with them will almost certainly not be fast enough and may not be wide enough either.\\n{{infobox|Lens focal lengths|In discussing focal length, we assume a 35mm film camera or \\\"full frame\\\" digital camera. For other types of camera, the actual numbers are different but the \\\"35mm equivalent\\\" is often quoted.}}\\nLong exposures are often required to capture faint lights. Here's what you need for a sporting chance:\\n\\n* A camera that supports '''manual exposure''' (5 to 40 seconds)\\n* A '''fast lens''' (aperture f/2.8 or better). Typically, a [[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|wide-angle lens]] is used to get a large area of sky.\\n* '''Fast film''' (800 ASA or better), or equivalent ISO setting on a digital camera\\n* A '''tripod''' to hold the long exposure\\n* '''Cable release or self-timer''' to trigger shots without stirring the camera\\n: Even better, for some cameras a '''remote control''' is available. Some cameras can use a wireless '''smartphone connection''' as remote control, but few smartphones are made for the conditions.\\n* '''Manual focus'''. It is not recommended to just focus your lens to infinity, instead it is best done by aiming at the Moon or a bright star (ideally in the live-view mode and using the maximum zoom).\\n* Multiple '''spare batteries and memory cards''': only having them will ensure they won't be needed. Keep the spares warm.\\n* What you don't need is the lens '''filter''': it can cause interference, so better take it off your lens.\\n[[File:Aurora shapes.jpg|thumb|405x405px|Images with Canon EOS 400D, ISO 1600, f/2.8, exposure 4s\\u201330s, 17mm (24 full frame).]]\\nWith a digital camera shooting in RAW format (or at least JPG + RAW) is a good idea: if something goes wrong in the field, there is more space for corrections in post-processing that way.\\n\\nAvoid breathing on the lens, the viewer or the display to prevent frosting them up. A light source such as a flashlight or headlamp can be useful when setting up the camera and tripod, and a smartphone is handy for alerts and forecasts. However, you need to get your eyes adjusted to darkness, so it is a good idea to limit use of these and set both phone and camera LCD displays to minimum brightness.\\n\\nThe ideal location has no light pollution, offers some shelter against wind, and is easily accessible. On a cold arctic night, you definitely want to avoid lugging camera and tripod a long distance or standing around in windy conditions waiting for the right shot. Moreover, wind tends to shake the camera, which is a problem in long exposures. A bigger, sturdier tripod helps with that, but is even worse to lug around.  If possible, do some scouting by day so you can go straight to a good location at night. It is not always possible to find a great location, but even a reasonable one can give better photos with less discomfort.\\n\\nAlso, try to get something interesting in the foreground; the [[#Europe|Norwegian photo below]] is a fine example. A shot of just the sky and some snow can be a bit boring even if the Lights are good.\\n\\nEither a zoom (variable focal length) or a prime (single focal length) lens can be used; each type has advantages. Zoom lenses are more flexible; you can adjust quickly for different sizes of light display. Primes are generally significantly faster than zooms, lighter and more compact; in many cases they also give a sharper picture than a zoom lens set to the same focal length.\\n\\n[[File:Aurora borealis over Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska.jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora borealis in [[Alaska]]]]<!-- image referenced in the text, check if you move or exchange it -->\\n\\n[[Travel_photography/Full_systems#Wide-angle_lenses|Wide-angle lenses]] are the commonest choice for photographing the lights. They give some distortion, even producing \\\"fish-eye\\\" images in extreme cases. The photo to the right was taken with a 16mm lens; the horizon appears curved and the trees in the foreground appear slightly off vertical, but some viewers would not notice this distortion and few would find it bothersome. The [[#Time_of_year|Scandinavian photo above]] used an even wider lens and has more distortion. A slightly longer lens, perhaps 24mm, would reduce the distortion but cover less of the sky. This is where zoom lenses have a significant advantage over primes; with, say, a 16\\u201335mm zoom you can adjust each shot to get the best trade-off between distortion and coverage. In other conditions, you might carry several primes and adjust by swapping lenses, but this is remarkably inconvenient in the field in an arctic night.\\n\\nA faster lens or a high-ISO camera setting can reduce exposure time, which is good. The photo to the right used an F2.8 lens and 25-second exposure. With F4, it would need 50 seconds, at or perhaps beyond the upper limit for practical shooting. An F1.4 lens would cut the time to around six seconds. This is quite likely to give a sharper photo because the lights move less during exposure, and it allows a bit more control over the shot; if you hit the shutter release when the sky looks particularly interesting, it is more likely to stay that way for a few seconds than over a longer time. This is where prime lenses have an advantage; they are often quite a bit faster than zooms. \\n\\nCombine a fast lens with a camera that allows high ISO settings and you might get exposure time down under a second, but it is not certain that this would give a better photo. High ISO settings give more noise in the image and you might lose more from that than you gain from the shorter time.\\n\\nFast wide lenses are expensive. Checking full-frame Canon lenses on an American vendor's site mid-2013, the cheapest lenses that might be suitable for shooting the Lights are a 40mm F2.8 at about $150 or 35/2.0 near $300; those are not wide enough to be ideal, but they would be usable and anything better is more expensive. More typical choices &mdash; for someone with a nice lens collection in hand or a good budget for building one &mdash; would be 20 or 24mm F2.8, 28/1.8, or the 17\\u201340 F4 zoom, in the $450 to $750 price range. The ideal choice might be either a 24/1.4 prime or 16\\u201335 F2.8 zoom, but these are high-end products mainly for professional photographers; either is around $1500. An ultra-wide 14mm F2.8 is a very good choice, and while those with auto-focus cost over $2000, some manual focus versions are available for a significantly lower price. Other brands have a different set of products and prices, but the overall pattern is similar. Companies other than the camera manufacturers also offer lenses, but again the pattern is similar.\\n\\nSee [[travel photography]] for more general discussion.\\n\\n==Locations==\\n[[File:Rovaniemi - Aurora Borealis.jpg|thumb|Aurora in [[Rovaniemi]], [[Finland]]]]\\nNorthern Lights usually form about 100 km (60 miles) above the surface of the earth. In principle, all areas under the Northern Lights oval are good observation points. However, most of these areas are remote and inaccessible, and suffer harsh climatic conditions.\\n\\nWhen selecting an observation site:\\n* If using a car, stay close to it. A typical car heater cannot actually keep a large metal vehicle warm when it is well below zero outside, but it is better than nothing and a car does provide shelter against wind. In really cold weather, leave the engine running even when you are away from the car, since the engine may have trouble starting again.\\n* Try finding accommodation in an area known to be good for viewing the Northern Lights. This may include a cottage, wilderness hut, a heated tent or similar shelter. This avoids long drives late at night to get to and from the viewing area.\\n* Avoid locations with light pollution; try to get away from populated areas. If this is not possible, try to have at least the northern view free of light pollution.\\n* Avoid steep hillsides or other major obstacles to the north.\\n\\nConsider bringing a tent or just a portable windbreak to provide some shelter from wind. Also vacuum flasks for hot beverages.\\n\\nViewing or photographing the Lights is an activity where hiring a local guide or paying for a tour is often worthwhile. A guide's local knowledge can help in several areas: coping with the weather, finding good sites, choosing good routes, and avoiding close encounters with [[dangerous wildlife]] such as polar bears or musk oxen. Also, a guide or tour company will have vehicles and other equipment suitable for the conditions. In remote areas it may not be possible to rent a vehicle or bring your own and, even if it is possible, it is not advisable unless both vehicle and driver are well prepared for [[winter driving]]. Some tours offer unusual transport options such as snowmobiles or sleds pulled by dogs, reindeer or horses; few tourists could safely drive those, and no owner of valuable animals is likely to allow a visitor to handle them unsupervised.\\n\\nVarious locations provide some kind of infrastructure, like tours, observation points etc. Here are lists of some major ones, in approximately west-to-east order:\\n\\n===North America===\\n{{seealso|Winter in North America}}\\n[[File:Flickr - DVIDSHUB - Alaska Aurora Borealis (Image 1 of 2).jpg|thumb|400px|Aurora in [[Alaska]]]]\\n*[[Fairbanks]], Alaska: famous for aurora viewing, with many tours and sites that cater to aurora watchers.\\n*[[Yellowknife]], in Canada's Northwest Territories, also with many tours\\n*[[Churchill]], on Hudson's Bay in Manitoba, is right smack dab in the center of the auroral belt, and offers the opportunity to see (lots of) polar bears on the same trip.\\n*[[Isle Royale National Park]], Upper Michigan, is a leave-no-trace park with no tours and few facilities. This is the best place in the 48 contiguous US sates to see the lights because it is quite far north and there is no light pollution.\\n\\n===North Atlantic islands===\\n\\n*[[Kangerlussuaq]], Greenland: very high chance of seeing the Lights from November to March. If dogsled or snowmobile rides are desired, mid-late winter is recommended.\\n*[[M\\u00fdvatn]], Iceland: offers the unique experience of observing aurorae while soaking in a natural geothermal bath. The capital, [[Reykjavik]], serves as a base for many tours.\\n*[[Berneray]], Outer Hebrides: this remote Scottish island offers suitable conditions for northern lights observation due to low light pollution.\\n\\n===Europe===\\n[[File:Aurora over Haja-3,2.jpg|thumb|Near Troms\\u00f8\\u200e, Norway]]<!-- linked in the Photography section, check the reference if changing header or file -->\\n\\n{{Seealso|Winter in the Nordic countries}}\\n\\n* [[Abisko]], Northern Sweden. A popular place where the northern lights can be watched from the Aurora Sky Station at the top of the mountain Nuolja.\\n* [[Troms\\u00f8]], Northern Norway, is an easily accessible location with mild weather and numerous excursions. However the coastal location makes it susceptible to overcast conditions. Nearby [[Skibotn]] enjoys a dryer climate (very dry for Norway); this makes for better viewing opportunities. Another nearby location is [[Senja]] island.\\n* [[Alta]], also in Norway but further to the north-east and known for prehistoric rock carvings, is marketed also as a place to watch northern lights.\\n* [[Jukkasj\\u00e4rvi]], Northern Sweden, is the site of the original Ice Hotel, with excellent viewing infrastructure.\\n* [[Kilpisj\\u00e4rvi]], [[Inari]] and [[Utsjoki]] in Finnish Lapland all have quite dry weather and little light pollution.<!-- Nellim is another village which is far from light pollution. Add when there is an article.--> The ski resorts [[Saariselk\\u00e4]] in Inari and [[Levi]] in Kittil\\u00e4 have accommodation in glass igloos specially designed for enjoying the northern lights.\\n* The Kola Peninsula of [[Murmansk Oblast]] is Russia's most popular viewing spot.\\n\\nThe likelihood of seeing aurorae rapidly decreases when going south. In [[Helsinki]], aurorae occur about once a month, and are usually masked by light pollution or clouds. Aurorae seen further outside of the auroral belts may also be much less vivid, with fewer colours.\\n\\n=== Cruise ships ===\\nA luxurious way to see the lights is to take a [[cruise ship]] along the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Alaska]], or toward [[Antarctica]] for the Southern Lights, in the appropriate season. Cruises tend to be expensive, but the costs may be quite reasonable compared to flying to a good site on land and paying for accommodation and tours there. Viewing the Lights by just strolling on deck after dinner is much more convenient than being driven somewhere to stand in the snow, and the chance of encounters with dangerous wildlife is lower. \\n\\nThere may be problems with this; not all cruise lines run in winter and it is ''extremely'' difficult to get good photos from a moving ship when the subject requires long exposures, as the lights generally do. If the cruise is not specially for aurora viewing, chances are that light pollution from the ship itself is an issue.\\n\\n=== In flight ===\\nMany travelers in the northern latitudes find themselves treated to an aerial view of the lights. It's probably not realistic to ''plan'' to see them while on a plane, but if you find yourself taking frequent flights in upper latitudes, consider opting for a window seat on the northern side of the plane. If the show is good enough, the captain will usually make an announcement.\\n\\nIf you thought cruises on the seas were expensive, you probably won't be interested in heading up into '''[[space]]''', but orbital flight at around $35 million/person is a pretty surefire way to see the lights, both Northern and Southern, with zero light interference, and quite a grand view!\\n\\n== The ''Southern'' Lights ==\\n[[File:Aurora Australis Over the Tasman Sea from SouthWest National Park.jpg|thumb|Aurora Australis as seen at the remote New Harbour Beach in Tasmania's Southwest National Park]]\\nAurorae happen in an oval about the South Magnetic Pole just as they do about the North one, and the South Magnetic Pole is similarly offset from the geographic [[South Pole]]. Would-be observers of the '''Southern Lights''' or '''''Aurora Australis''''' benefit from the happy accident that the offset of the South Magnetic Pole is generally in the direction of [[Australia]], although the Pole itself is still in [[Antarctica]] like the geographic one. The southern parts of Australia and [[New Zealand]] get more than their share of Lights relative to their latitude.\\n\\nIn particular, [[Tasmania]] and the [[South Island]] of New Zealand are places where the Lights can be observed several times a year. If conditions are right, [[Hobart]] and [[Invercargill]] offer the best chance in places that are quickly accessible from within Australia and New Zealand.  Although [[Christchurch]] has a geographic latitude south of [[Hobart]], its \\\"geomagnetic latitude\\\" is further north, and aurora there are no more likely than southern [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. Check the space weather while you are travelling.\\n[[File:AuroraAustralisDisplay.jpg|thumb|Southern Lights seen from [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]]]\\n\\nAll these locations are still outside the auroral belt itself, so the odds of catching the lights during your trip there are not good. Because of the skew towards the Eastern Hemisphere, it is not reasonable to expect any viewing from [[Patagonia]], and it's not that likely you'll see them even from the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The best place to view them would be Antarctica's [[Ross Sea]] via [[Macquarie Island]] (Australia) or the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]]. The best viewing would be from the boat itself. The closest island to the auroral belt that has a good range of tourist accommodation is [[Stewart Island]]. \\n\\nThere is day trip flight from [[Sydney]] to see the Southern Lights (A$1,295+).\\n\\nAll of the considerations about maximizing your chances of seeing the Northern Lights apply equally to seeing the Southern Lights, except that the Southern Hemisphere seasons should be taken into account in regards to maximizing the hours of darkness.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Astronomy]]\\n* [[Midnight sun]] \\u2014 at latitudes where there's dark all day in the winter and people travel to see the Northern Lights, there's usually light all night in the summer.\\n{{PartOfTopic|Natural attractions|the Arctic}}\\n{{guidetopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Midnight sun banner Inari.jpg|caption=Midnight sun in Inari, Finland}}\\n\\n'''Midnight sun''' is the sun being above horizon throughout the night, while '''polar night''' is when the sun stays below it even in the day. They can be experienced in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n{{seealso|Astronomy}}\\n\\n[[File:Just Midnight....., Greenland - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Midnight sun in [[Greenland]]]]\\n\\nThe Earth's axis is tilted by 23 degrees in relation to the ecliptic (the plane of its orbit around the Sun) and this causes the seasons. When your part of Earth is tilted toward the Sun, you get summer; when it is tilted away, winter. For any latitude, the angle between vertical and the noon sun ranges from latitude minus tilt at the summer solstice to latitude plus tilt at the winter solstice, and is exactly the latitude on the equinoxes. In the tropics \\u2014 within 23 degrees of the equator \\u2014 that range includes 0\\u00b0 so at times the Sun is directly overhead. In Arctic or Antarctic regions \\u2014 within 23 degrees of the poles \\u2014 it includes 90\\u00b0 so at times the Sun is on or below the horizon even at noon or is above the horizon even at midnight\\n\\nThe tilt varies somewhat with time, so the figures given here are not exact. More importantly, topography and human-built structures are crucial when the sun is low. Also the refracting effect of the atmosphere is on average 0.5\\u00b0, the same as the diameter of the sun, and varies considerably in winter at high latitudes (thus especially affecting the beginning and end of polar night). In a level landscape, such as at sea, the sun seems to barely touch the horizon when it actually is just below it (with average refraction). In different tables, sunset and sunrise can be calculated according to either edge of the sun or its centre, either taking average refraction into account or ignoring it. In conclusion: don't expect the sun to rise or set exactly at times given in any source; the midnight sun is probably visible also a bit south of the Arctic Circle in Midsummer, at least as seen from a hill top without obstructions to the north (and the other way round in the southern hemisphere).\\n\\nIf you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in the winter you will experience the '''polar night''', which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon. This offers a good opportunity to see the [[Aurora borealis]], as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock. As the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars. There will probably be snow, which will magnify the light from stars, moon and auroras. In addition to the wintry lights, you will also have dawn and dusk, just no sunrise between them. Near the poles, there is twilight only in autumn and spring, and right at the poles there is in a way just one day and one night every year. The sun only rises and sets once a year \\u2014 the sun emerges around the spring equinox, takes until the summer solstice to reach its highest point and then slowly descends to disappear entirely around the autumn equinox.\\n\\nA '''white night''' is a related phenomenon. When the sun is barely below the horizon at midnight, the sky never turns dark. White nights can be experienced around the summer solstice down to 60 degrees of latitude, that of towns and cities such as [[Homer]], [[Whitehorse]], [[Qaqortoq]], [[Oslo]], [[Stockholm]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]. Places closer to the poles have a longer white night season.\\n\\n== Planning ==\\n[[File:Sommernatt i Troms\\u00f8 (7466198800).jpg|thumb|A sunny summer's night in Troms\\u00f8, Norway]]\\n\\n=== Time of the year ===\\nTo see the midnight sun, you need to be north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic circle (above 90-23=67\\u00b0 latitude) at a time close to the summer solstice, June 21 in the northern hemisphere or December 21 in the southern. To experience the polar night, you should travel there close to the winter solstice, with the dates the other way around. Going far enough to the north or south the exact date is less important; at the poles midnight sun and polar night will last about half a year each. The website [https://www.suncalc.org/#/70.4294,-151.4135,3/2022.04.21/12:09/1/3 SunCalc] can be very useful for figuring out at what time of the year to go. \\n\\n=== Time of the day ===\\nIf you want to see the sun at midnight, you clearly have to be out at midnight. Notice that your watch shows the time of your time zone, which usually is not the same as local sun time. If you want to see the sun at its lowest, it is the latter you have to observe. In [[Qaanaaq]], Greenland, that means 02:37 wall clock time (accounting for daylight saving time). North-western Alaska and some parts of Russia have a similar offset.\\n\\nFor polar night, you can enjoy the darkness most of the time. If you want to take advantage of the dawn and dusk in the middle of the day, be outdoors before first sign of dawn. For [[Northern Lights|auroras]], check the separate article.\\n\\n=== Weather ===\\nObviously you won't see the sun on a cloudy night, so it is a good idea to check the weather forecast before leaving. Also, some regions have cloud cover more often than others.\\n\\nEven in midsummer, it can be cold at high latitudes. Near-freezing temperatures are possible at nearly any of the destinations. In most regions you would travel to, temperatures are more likely to be chilly to warm, though.\\n\\nFor polar night, advice for [[cold weather]] applies to the extreme: you will be at high latitudes nearly at their coldest time. Tourist businesses may be well equipped to deal with this, but check \\u2013 and you will need proper clothes also when not being taken care of.\\n\\n== Prepare ==\\n\\n===Photography===\\n[[File:\\u041f\\u043e\\u043b\\u044f\\u0440\\u043d\\u044b\\u0439_\\u0434\\u0435\\u043d\\u044c_\\u043d\\u0430\\u0434_\\u043e\\u0437._\\u041e\\u0436\\u043e\\u0433\\u0438\\u043d\\u043e.jpg|thumb|Multiple exposure of the midnight sun on Lake Ozhogino in [[Yakutia]], Russia]]\\nSome of the most interesting photos of the midnight sun use time lapse techniques to get multiple images of the sun as it drops toward the horizon then reverses direction and begins climbing back into the sky. These require a tripod and a moderately wide-angle lens. The timing can be done manually, but it is much easier if the camera can be set to do it for you.\\n\\nSee [[travel photography]] for more general advice.\\n\\n===Ramadan===\\n[[Muslim]]s may have a problem if they are at high latitudes during the fasting month of [[Ramadan]]; the basic rule is that Muslims do not eat or drink while the sun is in the sky during that month; that would be fatal if followed rigorously in summer at high latitude.\\n\\nVarious groups of Muslim clerics allow various modified rules: use [[Mecca]] time, the  time of the nearest Muslim country or the solar time of your original home country, fast for a fixed number of hours each day, or fast in a different month since in spring or autumn the days are around 12 hours even at extreme latitude. However, some clerics insist that there can be no exceptions.\\n\\nMuslim travellers should plan ahead for this issue and consult their religious leaders if it is likely to be a problem.\\n\\n==Destinations==\\n{{mapframe|name=Destinations with midnight sun on the Northern Hemisphere|height=190}}\\n\\nBy definition, the midnight sun and the polar night can be seen in two areas:\\n* '''[[Arctic]]''' regions, including parts of the following (from west to east):\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Arctic Alaska]]|lat=68.5 | long=-151}}\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Northern Canada]]|lat=67.5 | long=-106}} (the northern parts of it)\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Greenland]]|lat=70|long=-44}} (most of it)\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Iceland]]|lat=66.4 | long=-18}} (some locations)\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Northern Norway]]|lat=70|long=23}} and {{marker|type=see|name=[[Svalbard]]|lat=78.7|long=17.4}}\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Norrbotten County|Norrbotten]]|lat=67.6 | long=20.7}} ([[Sweden]])\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Finnish Lapland]]|lat=68|long=26}} ([[Finland]])\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=[[Murmansk Oblast]]|lat=68.1|long=34.9}} ([[Russia]])\\n**{{marker|type=see|name=north of [[Urals]], [[Siberia]] and [[Russian Far East]]|lat=70 | long=100}} (other northern parts of Russia)\\n* '''[[Antarctica]]''' (except the northern tip of the Peninsula)\\n[[File:Polar day in Naryan-Mar.jpg|thumb|right|A midnight sun in Naryan-Mar on June 21, 2017 at 23:52 local time]]\\nThe Gulf Stream warms northern Europe; the regions with white nights or midnight sun there are much more accessible than elsewhere. [[Inuvik]], one of the biggest settlement where midnight sun can be seen in Canada, has 3,000-some inhabitants, and is at the end of a 737-km mostly unpaved road. In Alaska, the main Arctic settlements [[Utqia\\u0121vik]] and [[Kotzebue]] have the same magnitude of population (counting seasonal workers in the former). On the other hand, Finnish [[Rovaniemi]] at the polar circle has more than 50,000 inhabitants and is served by daily sleeper trains. There are several cities along the Norwegian Arctic coastline, with [[Troms\\u00f8]] (80,000) having midnight sun for about 10 weeks. [[Murmansk]] (280,000), on the Kola Peninsula of Russia, is the world's largest city north of the Arctic Circle, with 2 months of midnight sun, and is served by daily trains. [[Naryan-Mar]] (21,000), the capital of [[Nenetsia]], is also in European Russia and due to relatively high standard of living among Russian cities, also suitable for viewing. Farther east, including all of Asian Russia, the Arctic is far off the beaten path, although there are some quite big cities (mostly living from mining, oil, shipping or military), with frequent flights. For example, [[Norilsk]], the greatest Asian city north of the Arctic Circle (175,000), can only be visited by citizens of Russia.\\n\\nThe Antarctic region is in the ''Screaming Sixties'' \\u2013 mostly open ocean with strong winds \\u2013 and southward. The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] is the most accessible destination at high latitude on the southern hemisphere, and the [[Esperanza Base]] just has white nights; you need to go a few hundred kilometres farther to see the midnight sun.\\n\\n== Cope ==\\nWith the sun shining all night long, it is often difficult to sleep properly. It might be a good idea to check with your hotel if there are proper thick curtains in the rooms. Be sure to bring a sleep mask.\\n\\nIn a pinch, you might be able to put together makeshift curtains by attaching aluminium foil to the inside of the window to block out the light (complicated if the windows are large).\\n\\n== Stay safe ==\\nAs always, looking at the sun is dangerous for your eyes. The sun may not look bright when near the horizon, but it is still capable of giving you blind spots.\\n\\n{{PartOfTopic|Natural attractions}}\\n{{usabletopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Tundra Banner.jpg|caption=}}\\n\\nThe '''tundra''' is a biome between the coldest parts of the [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] and the temperate climates found e.g. in [[Northern Europe]] and southern [[Canada]].

It is most famous for the October 1600 Battle of Sekigahara, but its picturesque location nestled in a small valley between mountains, combined with its complete lack of large tour buses, makes it a nice day trip from the larger nearby cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Nagoya]], and [[Kanazawa]]. The small size of the town and the well-marked paths between historic sites makes Sekigahara even more appealing, as a visitor can traverse the entire battlefield in about a day.\\n\\nYou will need a solid understanding of Japanese, or a good translator, if you wish to interact with the town on a deeper level, but English-language material is available in the museums and on historical signs by the sites.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Sekigaharascreen.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the Battle of Sekigahara]]\\n\\nSekigahara was the site of the epic '''Battle of Sekigahara''' (\\u95a2\\u30f6\\u539f\\u5408\\u6226  ''Sekigahara gassen'') between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Ishida Mitsunari, representing Toyotomi Hideyoshi's son and designated successor Toyotomi Hideyori. The Cliff's Notes version: Ishida's Western Alliance had 120,000 troops against the 75,000 of Tokugawa's Eastern Alliance, but Tokugawa cleverly exploited various grievances in Ishida's ranks to convince six ''daimyo'' (regional warlords) to defect along with some 23,000 troops, tipping the scales of the battle. A mere two hours after the battle began on the morning of October 21, 1600, the Western Alliance was in tatters and a total of some 40,000 lay dead. Ishida escaped but was captured and executed on November 6th.\\n\\nTokugawa's victory on heralded the beginning of the Edo Period, and with it the rise of the Shogunate. The destruction of most of the forces of the Western Alliance allowed Tokugawa to rapidly consolidate control of Japan within the following four months, as previously-Western or neutral daimyos either joined with Tokugawa or were crushed by him. Consequently, the town is filled with ruins, memorials and shrines to the dead. (There is a river called Kurochigawa (\\u9ed2\\u8840\\u5ddd, \\\"Black Blood River\\\"), where the Tokugawa armies washed the cut-off heads of those fallen in battle, but the name had originated in the Jinshin War in the 7th century under similar circumstances.) \\n\\nToday's Sekigahara is a rural town with a population just over 7,000. Due to its historical significance, Sekigahara is sister cities with both [[Waterloo]] in [[Belgium]] and [[Gettysburg]] in the [[United States of America|US]]. It can also be inundated with Japanese tourists (particularly schoolchildren) because of its importance in Japanese history during certain parts of the Japanese school year.\\n\\n===Tourist information===\\n* {{Listing|name=Sekigahara Tourist Information Center|alt=\\u95a2\\u30f6\\u539f\\u99c5\\u524d\\u89b3\\u5149\\u4ea4\\u6d41\\u9928 Sekigahara ekimae kank\\u014d k\\u014dry\\u016b-kan|address=598-4, Sekigahara|lat=35.363542|long=136.470854|hours=09:00-17:00, closed Tu and the day after a holiday|lastedit=2024-05-02|content=The main tourist information center in town.

If coming from [[Kyoto]] (as most Western tourists tend to do), take the Shinkansen to Maibara, and then change to the JR Tokaido Line. The Shinkansen leg takes 19 minutes and the Tokaido leg takes 21 minutes, so the trip can be done in about an hour or even quicker if you time it right with trains. Make sure to take the ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' Shinkansen, as that will stop at every station (the other Shinkansen do not stop at Maibara). Maibara is the first stop going east from Kyoto on the ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' Shinkansen. If traveling on a Seishun 18 ticket or other pass that does not permit use of the Shinkansen, take the Special Rapid (\\u65b0\\u5feb\\u901f) to Maibara and change to the JR Central portion of the Tokaido line.

To the south of the town lies the E1 (Meishin) expressway that runs between [[Nagoya|Komaki]] (outside of Nagoya) and [[Nishinomiya]]. Both roads meander through narrow(ish) mountain valleys in the heart of rural Japan, and while they are in good condition (as of March 2023), they are quite far from the major tourist sites (about 1.5 hours from Kyoto and 45 minutes from Nagoya). Unless you are already staying in the [[Lake Biwa]] area or around [[Ogaki]], it's faster to buy a train ticket and take the trains.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nThere are no public buses that transport people into or through the town.

The entire town can be walked within a few hours, and it's probably well within reason to state that any part of the town is within a 20- to 30-minute walk from the Station. \\n\\nSome historic sites are located on the top of hills or small mountains. While everything is easily walked, some trails are stepped (thus bicycles are not allowed) and can be quite steep. \\n\\n=== By bicycle ===\\nBicycles can be rented at the Tourist Center opposite the Station entrance, or at the Memorial Museum to the north of the Station.

The city is west of Tokyo's 23 downtown wards, bordering on [[Kanagawa]]. Machida City has relatively more nature than any other city in Tokyo. The town has been the setting for many manga and video games.\\n[[File:Buaiso stone pavement.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Buaiso]]\\n==Understand==\\nIt is the third most populous city in Tokyo. Machida is a city with a city and nature. The area in front of Machida station is busy with department stores and shopping areas, but away from the station you will find quiet residential areas, greenery and parks. Minami-Machida has been redeveloped with commercial facilities and a park at [https://gbp.minamimachida-grandberrypark.com/ Grandberry Park] (\\u30b0\\u30e9\\u30f3\\u30d9\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u30d1\\u30fc\\u30af).

This road network connected [[Kamakura]], the capital of the 12th century, with various places. As a stopping point for the road, a post town was established in Machida and prospered. It is said that there was a castle built in those days, but it has been replaced by a temple and a park. The Ruins of Idesawa Castle and the Ruins of Idesawa Battlefield are the Sugawara Shrine (\\u83c5\\u539f\\u795e\\u793e).\\n\\nIt also became prosperous as a transit point for the \\\"Silk Road\\\" that brought silk produced in [[Hachioji]] to [[Yokohama]] in the late 17th century. There are many old establishments with a long history. Established in 1884, Kakishimaya (\\u67ff\\u5cf6\\u5c4b), which supported \\\"Silk Road\\\" from long ago as a horse broker. Established in 1895, Masaya Shoten (\\u67fe\\u5c4b\\u5546\\u5e97), Machida's oldest dry goods store. Established in 1919, Tomisawa Shoten (\\u5bcc\\u6fa4\\u5546\\u5e97), which mainly deals in confectionery materials. Established in 1787, Oka Naozaburo Store (\\u5ca1\\u76f4\\u4e09\\u90ce\\u5546\\u5e97), a soy sauce brewer and distributor.\\n\\nDuring the war of the 20th century, Machida was spared from the fires of war, and the post-war reconstruction of the city prospered quickly. The Machida Nakamise shopping street (\\u753a\\u7530\\u4ef2\\u898b\\u4e16\\u5546\\u5e97\\u8857), which evolved from the post-war black market, retains the atmosphere of the 20th century.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n*Average spring temperatures are highs of 15-25&nbsp;\\u00b0C and lows of 4-17&nbsp;\\u00b0C.

The fastest ways to reach Machida from Shinjuku are by the Odakyu Rapid Express (\\u5feb\\u901f\\u6025\\u884c, marked with orange text) and Express trains (\\u6025\\u884c, written in red text). These trains depart frequently, every 10 minutes or less, and reach Machida from Shinjuku in about 29 to 35 minutes (\\u00a5360). Slower Semi-Express (\\u6e96\\u6025) or local trains can take about 45 to 55 minutes. Machida is also the first stop on all Limited Express services that run to Hakone. They take about the same time as a Rapid Express, but incur an additional \\u00a5400 surcharge. However, for that price you get your own comfortable seat, similar to those on a bullet train, so reserving a seat on this train especially during rush hour can make your ride a lot more pleasant.\\n\\nJR Yokohama Line trains make runs to Machida from Hachioji (20\\u201330 minutes, \\u00a5290) and Yokohama (30\\u201340 minutes, \\u00a5380).

(There is only one service, depending on the time of the day, you may get Kanachu or Keio service.)\\n==Get around==\\n{{Mapframe|35.542478|139.452153|zoom=12|height=400|width=400|layer=W}}\\n===By train===\\nTrains run on the Odakyu Line, the JR Yokohama Line and the Tokyu Denentoshi Line.

It is the seat of the Alt Empord\\u00e0 county in the [[Girona (province)|Girona Province]] and has a wealth of history spanning many centuries that has been preserved and shown in several museums in the area and in the compact Old Town.  Being the last major town before the Spanish/French border, it serves as a fantastic base to explore the upper Empord\\u00e1 region that is awash in great food, wines, and beaches that represent the Catalan culture. It is a stage in the [[Catalan Way of St. James]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\nThe city's main attraction is the world famous museum of native son, Salvador Dal\\u00ed . After the Prado in [[Madrid]], it is the most visited museum in all of Spain.  It is often seen as part of a day-trip from [[Barcelona]] or the packaged hotels of [[Costa Brava]].\\n[[File:Esgl\\u00e9sia de Sant Pere in Figueres 19.JPG|right|thumb|Sant Pere church]]\\nBut beyond the museum, Figueres can be a pleasant place to spend a night or two.  The town, much like Girona, is a relaxed alternative to Barcelona with caf\\u00e9s on side streets, and a compact Old Town core.  The Empord\\u00e0 region in general will appeal to those interested in the history or the burgeoning viticulture and gastronomy of Northern Catalonia.  Figueres works well as a base for day trips to these destinations. Figueres is also 15 minutes by car or 25 minutes by train from the beaches of the Costa Brava.\\n\\nThe name of the town means 'fig trees' as they used to grow in great abundance around the area.  Local youth often refer to the town as 'Figui' for short.\\n\\n===History===\\nFigueres descended from two Roman towns, Junc\\u00e0ria and Fig\\u00e0ries, but the establishment of the town really started to happen in the 10th century as stated in records from the Sant Pere Monastery that was located where the Sant Pere church is today. As it was not an outpost border town in the Marca Hispanica (such as neighboring [[Besal\\u00fa]] or Peralada), it was of little significance until it was made a Royal Town in 1267 and then much later, when the Sant Ferran castle was built from 1753 to 1766.\\n\\nOnce the castle was finished, fortunes changed a great deal for Figueres as it became the supply base for the castle. The population grew and it started its course towards being the major town of the region, despite occupation by Napoleon's forces from 1808\\u20131814. Between 1831 and 1840, the Rambla was created by covering a dry riverbed, and became a center for the town. The shade trees that stand on the Rambla were planted in 1864. In 1877, the railway station was opened. In 1904, the town's most famous resident, one Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dal\\u00ed i Dom\\u00e8nech was born.\\n\\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) was quite hard on the town. The castle became the last outpost for Republican Spain and Franco's forces bombed the town with great ferocity. As was the case with a lot of the surrounding area, many structures were lost in the war, including the main theater, which stood in ruin for several decades.\\n\\nUpon attaining critical and financial success around the world, Dal\\u00ed bought the old theater in his home town and converted it in to the museum that we see today, and which is a major draw of tourism to the town.\\n\\n===Tourist information ===\\n*[https://visitcatalonia.net/figueres/ Figueres] information from Visit Catalonia \\n\\n==Talk==\\nEverybody in Figueres can speak [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]], albeit to varying degrees. Although [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] was banned by the Franco regime and Spanish was the only language, the older generation above 60, when speaking Spanish, will often speak a form of \\\"Spatalan\\\", which is mostly Spanish but with a lot of Catalan tossed in. It can be difficult to understand at times for foreigners. Catalan is as separate a language from Spanish as French and Italian are. It is not a Spanish dialect.\\n\\nNorthern Catalan, which is spoken here, is strongly influenced by French through the interchange with French and Catalan speakers across the border . Such dishes as 'pa amb tomaquet' (bread with tomato) become 'pa amb tomate' with a soft 'uh' sound at the end. There are many more examples and one of the most difficult is when they say words that end with 'o' and say it with a long 'u' sound. If you make the effort to say neighboring town names in Catalan, make sure you understand the pronunciation and if you say Barcelona pronouncing the Castillian 'th' sound for the 'c', people will assume that you are speaking Spanish.\\n\\nThe generation under 35 will generally speak some if not a good deal of English and French. Some people may speak a little Italian and oddly enough, there is a large Russian-speaking community in Figueres.\\n\\n== Get in ==\\n{{Mapframe | 42.265 | 2.960 | height=500 | width=550 | zoom=14 }}\\n=== By plane === \\n[[Girona]] Costa Brava Airport ({{IATA|GRO}}) has budget flights by Ryanair.

Depending on your level of interest, a visit to the museum can be anywhere from one hour to most of the day. The central building was the old town theater, long vacant after being bombed during the Spanish Civil War. Even art fans who are otherwise lukewarm to Dal\\u00ed's general artistry can find visiting here a rewarding experience, and may come out with new appreciation for the eccentric genius. The museum also contains displays of other Catalan artists. Many major works were removed by Spanish authorities shortly after his death and displayed in the Prado, in Madrid.<br>The number of visitors is limited and only tickets not sold online can be purchased at the ticket office. It is recommended to purchase tickets online in advance (at least one day before, since same-day tickets are not available online). You can have an audioguide for \\u20ac1 per room--although Dal\\u00ed's original concept was to not allow ''any'' guides explaining anything to visitors: they should understand as much as they're able to without help. Crowds are large during the summer months. Weekends are best avoided as the experience will not be pleasant. Also to be avoided are cloudy days in the summer, as those on a beach holiday will inevitably make a trip to the museum.\\n| wikipedia=Dal\\u00ed Theatre and Museum\\n| wikidata=Q1143722}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=Museu del Joguet | alt= | url=http://www.mjc.cat/ | email=\\n| address=Sant Pere, 1, hotel Par\\u00eds | lat=42.266686 | long=2.960761 | directions=You can see it from La Rambla\\n| phone=+34 972 504 585 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\u20ac7 for adults; \\u20ac4 for students, those older than 65, and children.\\n| wikidata=Q17043801\\n| content=A museum dedicated toys with more than 4,500 toys from many periods in history.

It has a long history of being a prison (from the north side, you can see the new provincial prison across the highway), and was occupied by Napoleon's forces. Visiting it is a pleasant 10-minute walk straight up from the Dal\\u00ed Museum. Walking around the perimeter of the castle is a flat, 3-km walk that gives a splendid view over the Empord\\u00e0 Plain out to the sea. Locals regularly come up to castle to walk or run around it as it is free to walk around and always 'open'. The interior is also viewable with hours that change depending on the season of the year and reasonably priced (\\u20ac4 for an adult). Additionally there is a caf\\u00e9 inside the castle for those looking to relax.\\n| wikidata=Q1048695}}\\n\\n[[File:Face of Dali 1025.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Face of Dali]]\\n* {{listing | type=see\\n| name=The Face of Dal\\u00ed | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=42.2665 | long=2.9619 | directions=Directly at the bottom of the Rambla\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| image=Face of Dali 1025.jpg\\n| content=As an homage to their native son, the town of Figueres placed a surrealist tribute to him at the base of the Rambla.

There is a resurgence of viticulture in the region, and is creating some of the most noteworthy wines in all of Catalonia, especially for the price.\\n\\nAs Figueres is the seat of Alt Empord\\u00e0, it also houses the offices for the local [http://www.doemporda.com/ DO Empord\\u00e0] region which can be found at Avinguda Marignane, 2. The office can provide more information, although the website is extremely helpful in locating wineries.\\n\\nFor those wishing to make a tour of the wineries, you will definitely need a car as they are in far-flung villages around the area.  Closest to Figueres are the wineries of [http://www.lavineta.es La Vinyeta] and [http://www.castilloperelada.com/ Perelada].  The former is a very new, modern winery started by a young winemaker who is making some of the most exciting wines in the region neat the village of Mollets.  The later is a much more established winery that sits next to the castle of Perelada, which is a small town about five minutes by car from Figueres.  Their wines are rather pricey, but they have grown to carry a high pedigree whether deserved or not.  Perelada also charges for tastings, which is rather uncommon.\\n\\nOutside of these two regions, a drive up to the village Cantallops is recommended as in addition to being a delightful town, it houses the wineries of [http://www.vinyesdelsaspres.cat/ Vinyes dels Aspres] and Masia Serra.  Both of these wineries are making splendid wines, especially the sweet Garnatxas (Grenache) and Moscatells.  You will need to call Masia Serra before visiting though as it is rarely open to the public.\\n\\nAnother village worth visiting for wine is Capmany which has [http://www.cellerarchepages.com/ Arch\\u00e9 Pag\\u00e8s] and about 10 other wineries.\\n\\nHeading in the other direction, one can go to Vilaju\\u00efga which has  [http://www.empordalia.com/ Empord\\u00e0lia] which makes the Sinols brand.  Additionally, they also have wine 'a granel' or in bulk that is of high quality and can be bought for less than \\u20ac1.50 a litre.\\n\\nThe local wine shops in Figueres sell all these brands for those wishing to take back something from Figueres that isn't related to Dal\\u00ed.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\nFigueres provides a variety of hotels, with rates much cheaper than in Barcelona, but generally comparable to Girona. In addition to actual hotel and hostel establishments there are a great many 'masias' in the area which are farm houses that were converted over to rural guest houses.

Violent crime is extremely rare and most issues resolve around petty theft when they happen.  As is the case in many places, beware of crowded areas and events as pickpockets can frequent these venues.\\n\\nIn the summer, it can get quite hot as is typical with coastal Catalonia. Make sure to drink plenty of water and cover your head if sensitive to heavy direct sunlight.\\n\\nIn the winter, it can be quite cold at times. While snow is exceptionally rare in Figueres proper, driving on the E-15 or the AP-7 north to France could very well require chains or snow tires near La Jonquera at certain times due to the pass often receiving a decent amount of snow.

Very popular in summer and renowned for its beaches, both sandy and stony.\\n* [[Girona]] - While most people will do a day trip from Girona or Barcelona to Figueres, one can also do the opposite and make days trips to the wonderful town of Girona from Figueres.\\n* [[Torroella de Montgr\\u00ed]] - A pleasant old town that was once the capital of the Emp\\u00faries kingdom.

A major port on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain, Barcelona has a wide variety of attractions that bring in tourists from around the globe. The many faces of Barcelona include the medieval Old Town, and the unique street grid resulting from 19th-century urban planning. The city has long sandy beaches and green parks on the hills, pretty much side-by-side. It is also famous for a number of prominent buildings, of which the most-known are by the architect Antoni Gaud\\u00ed, including his ''Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia'', which became Barcelona's symbol to many.\\n\\nFounded more than 2,000 years ago as the [[Roman empire|ancient Roman]] town ''Barcino'', Barcelona is as historic as it is modern, with a constant flow of projects changing the face of the city and long-standing penchant for design and innovation. Thanks to the wealth of attractions, a very well-developed accommodation base, a lively nightlife and a robust transportation system, Barcelona has become one of Europe's, and pretty much the world's, most popular tourist destinations.\\n\\n==Districts==\\n\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500|show=mask,go}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q941385|fill=#bdbd7b|title=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q64124|fill=#8888dc|title=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q852697|fill=#75bb75|title=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q753075|fill=#aa6baa|title=[[Barcelona/Sants-Montju\\u00efc|Sants-Montju\\u00efc]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q250935|fill=#67b7b7|title=[[Barcelona/Sant Mart\\u00ed|Sant Mart\\u00ed]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q959944, Q1765582, Q1771488, Q1641049, Q1650230 |fill=#c9815e|title=[[Barcelona/Inland Suburbs|Inland Suburbs]]}} <!-- Les Corts, Sarri\\u00e0-Sant Gervasi, Horta-Guinard\\u00f3, Nou Barris, Sant Andreu -->\\n\\n{{Mapshapes|Q237189|stroke-opacity=0.6}} <!-- metro -->\\n\\n{{Regionlist\\n| region1name=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]\\n| region1color=#bdbd7b\\n| region1description=Barcelona's old town, including the medieval Barri G\\u00f2tic, La Rambla (Les Rambles), Raval, and El Born (also known as La Ribera)\\n\\n| region2name=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]\\n| region2color=#8888dc\\n| region2description=Modernist quarter, central hub of the city, and ''the'' area to go to find Antoni Gaud\\u00ed's work.\\n\\n| region3name=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]\\n| region3color=#75bb75\\n| region3description=Formerly an independent town, it joined the city in the 20th century.

However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\\n\\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to [[Costa Daurada]], north to [[Costa Brava]] or out to sea for the [[Balearic Islands]].\\n\\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low. Given the high humidity, {{convert|19|-|23|\\u00b0C|0}} is considered comfortable weather, which is usually the temperature from May to June, and from late August to October. These are the best times to visit the city.  Anything warmer than this can feel too hot, and the period from November to April is quite chilly and at times gloomy.\\n\\n===With children===\\nToddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain. In any public place, people around you will make every effort possible to make your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them.

Fa\\u00e7ana de la Passi\\u00f3.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia church by Antoni Gaud\\u00ed is perhaps the most known landmark of Barcelona]]\\n\\nBarcelona's official languages are [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] and [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]. About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese. On the other hand, FGC announcements \\u2013 either regular or disruptions \\u2013 will be made only in Catalan, and disruption announcements on RENFE's network will usually be made only in Spanish. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a separate Romance language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.\\n\\nYou might find some locals answer in Catalan after being asked in Spanish, that's not because they are being rude but because they assume you are bilingual. In Catalonia, it's not uncommon to hear people code switching between different languages in the same conversation. In case you can't understand what they are saying, tell them you don't speak Catalan and politely ask them to repeat it in Spanish or English.\\n\\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia is a large scale immigration process from the rest of Spain, which occurred over the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language, and 40% use Catalan. The issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere.\\n\\nIn tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak English. If you are a native English speaker, you will have few problems, as Barcelona hosts many tourists.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\n[[File:Aeropuerto de Barcelona (1322744358).jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona International Airport]]\\nThe main airport is {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona El Prat|wikidata=Q56973}} ({{IATA|BCN}}). Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use the airports of ''[[Girona]]'' ({{IATA|GRO}}), nearly {{km|100}} to the north, or ''[[Reus]]'' ({{IATA|REU}}), around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair started operating at BCN, you should check carefully where your flight goes. The three-letter IATA code should be part of your booking process.\\n\\n====Barcelona International Airport====\\n{{main|Barcelona El Prat Airport}}\\n\\n[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Barcelona/en/Barcelona-El-Prat.html Barcelona International Airport] ({{IATA|BCN}}), also known as '''El Prat''', is a major transport hub, with flights from all over Europe and beyond, is by far the closest airport to the city. To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for \\u20ac5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs \\u20ac12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport) , tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (\\u20ac7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya on its way to Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya. See the Public Transport section in Get Around below for more information on tickets & passes as there were major changes in 2023.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Girona-Costa-Brava/en/Home.html Girona\\u2013Costa Brava Airport]====\\nThe Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estaci\\u00f3 del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport, synchronised with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs \\u20ac16 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac25. The journey takes approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Timetables are available [http://www.sagales.com/index.php?nIdioma=LANG3 online]. You can also take a train (you can choose between local ''Rodalies'', ''Media Distancia'' and high speed  AVE trains with different travel times and price points) to Girona main train station and a local bus from there to the airport.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Reus/en/ Reus Airport]====\\nThe easiest way is to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs \\u20ac13 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac24. The journey takes from 1 hr 30 min to 1 hr 45 min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available [http://www.igualadina.com/pdfs/REUS%20AIRPORT.pdf? online]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs \\u20ac7.25 and then the bus costs \\u20ac2.5. This takes about 2\\u00bd hours.

High-speed trains run frequently from main station {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona Sants|wikidata=Q800453|lat=41.37911238|long=2.139878268|url=https://www.adif.es/w/71801-barcelona-sants}} (in the southwest of the city) to Madrid, Seville and Malaga. There are also regular long-distance connections that partially use high-speed infrastructure to all major Spanish cities. The station is also served by many regional lines including {{rint|catalonia|rdc}}{{rint|catalonia|r1}}{{rint|catalonia|r2}}{{rint|catalonia|r2s}}{{rint|catalonia|r2n}}{{rint|catalonia|r3}}{{rint|catalonia|r4}}{{rint|catalonia|r11}}\\n\\nThe historic {{marker|type=go|name=Estaci\\u00f3 de Fran\\u00e7a|wikidata=Q800449}} now mostly serves regional trains.\\n\\nDirect regular [https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-europe/tgv-inoui-espagne/ high-speed train service] goes to destinations in France. In addition to two daily TGV services from [[Paris]] (travel time ~7 hr to Barcelona), there is a daily service from [[Lyon]] (5 hr), and a daily service from [[Marseille]] (4 hr). Prices start at \\u20ac39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\\n\\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerb\\u00e8re/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\\n\\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7\\u20138 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly \\u20ac30.\\n\\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called ''[http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/larga_distancia/productos/trenhotel.html Trenhotel]'' between Barcelona and Paris. ''Trenhotels'' still do, however, run between Barcelona and [[Granada]], [[A Coru\\u00f1a]] and [[Vigo]].\\n\\nThe security checks are taken seriously and may take some time.

Operation times are 05:00&ndash;24:00 (M&ndash;Th), 05:00&ndash;02:00 (F), and continuous service from Saturday at 05:00 until Sunday at midnight. Stations are marked {{rint|barcelona|metro}} on most maps; every station has a detailed map of exits to the city. Trains are fast, often coming in two minute intervals.

If you used a multiple journey ticket you won't be charged for a second time when changing lines as long as you are within the stated travel time for a single journey. Also, you can't repeat operator, so you can't use a FGC ride to make a shortcut. For instance: changing to L9S to L1 via L8 using Fira and Espanya will charge you with two journeys, you should go via Torrassa instead although its way longer.

For example, bus line 92 to Park G\\u00fcell, used by many tourists to get there after a visit to the Sagrada Familia, has been suspended, and a new line V15 stops there but takes a different route through the city centre (Passeig de Sant Joan).\\n\\nHere are some tips for bus line codes:\\n\\n* Hxx lines run parallel to the coastline, low numbers run on the high side, high numbers on the sea side.\\n* Vxx lines run from the beach to the hills, high numbers on the northern side (Bes\\u00f2s), low numbers on the southern (Llobregat).\\n* Dxx lines run in a somewhat diagonal path, although interestingly none of these cover neither Diagonal or Meridiana avenues, the main oblique streets.\\n* Mxx lines are found at the outer perimeter of metro coverage and link a metro stop to a neighbourhood lacking metro service.\\n* Bxx lines run on the northern area outside Barcelona or linking Barcelona to neighbouring municipalities in the metropolitan area, B stands for Bes\\u00f2s river.\\n* Lxx lines run on the southern area alike Bxx lines, L stands for Llobregat river.\\n* Some municipalities have lines fully inside the town limits with two letters and a digit, theses two letters are reminiscent of the town name, such as BDx for Badalona and LHx for L'Hospitalet\\n* Nxx lines run only at night when all other lines do not run, roughly from 23:00 to 6:00.\\n* Cxx lines link Barcelona the various northern coastal Maresme towns up to [[Matar\\u00f3]].\\n* Exx lines are express buses from Barcelona to various municipalities {{km|10-60}} outside of the metropolitan area.\\n* Lines with one or two digits without any letter follow historical routes from before the H-V-D schema.\\n* Lines between 100 and 199 are usually very local lines served with low-capacity cars and poor frequency, 30 min or worse. Notable cases are line 111 to the Tibidabo amusement park, line 120 through Ciutat Vella, and line 150 to Olympic venues and the Montju\\u00efc castle; others are mostly useless for tourists.\\n* Line numbers from 200 upwards are used for some routes going outside the metropolitan area, while some others of the same kind have no number at all.\\n\\nBuses H-V-D run about every 6\\u201312 min weekdays, 15\\u201320 min weekends. \\n\\nNitbus (N) run every 20 min all night.

It takes little over an hour to walk from Port Vell at the seaside to Park G\\u00fcell at the foothills of the mountain range at the northeastern end of the city, and you can see a range of attractions, including La Rambla and Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia, on your way. There are opportunities all around to sit down and enjoy a drink or a meal everywhere. If you are fit, you can pretty much explore the city by foot alone, unless the heat beats you in the warmer months (and then you can always resort to the air-conditioned metro).\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (\\u20ac3/hour, \\u20ac20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\\n\\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, ''Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes'' is actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\\n\\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\\n* Near ''Moll de Sant Bertran'' (which is south-west from ''Museu Maritim'') - driving at B\\u201310, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\\n* Somewhere near Guell Park.\\n* Near Font M\\u00e0gica, in Pla\\u00e7a Espanya and the Montju\\u00efc hill.\\n\\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.\\n\\n=== By taxi ===\\nAs of January 2019, [[Ride-sharing and carsharing services|ride-sharing services]] such as Uber require at least one hour's notice.

Bon\\u00c0rea, Bonpreu and Condis are the most popular supermarket chains from Catalonia. Mercadona, Consum, and Dia are other popular chains from the rest of Spain. All of them are a cost-effective way to purchase grocery items. There are also organic/specialty supermarkets like Casa Ametller or Veritas which are pricier. Small corner stores are the most visible on city streets, but tend to mark up prices in exchange for convenience.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nAs with all cities which welcome large numbers of tourists, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, but there are plenty of restaurants serving excellent food at very reasonable prices, if you know where to look. The usual rules of thumb apply: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track used by fellow travellers, and seek out caf\\u00e9s and restaurants which the locals frequent. In practice, this usually involves searching out eateries in residential districts away from the main sightseeing attractions. Avoid restaurants with touts outside, and have a basic understanding of the traditional foods served in restaurants, as well as the local drinks. One slightly crafty way of sussing a place's authenticity at a glance is to take note of how they spell a certain word: a menu board advertising ''tap'''a'''s'', written the Spanish/international way, is likely to be somewhere which primarily caters to tourists, whereas somewhere offering ''tap'''e'''s'', using Catalan spelling, is in all probability a venue frequented by locals.\\n\\nSome districts to check out include [[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]], which is a hub of quality, affordable Catalan cooking of both the traditional and more avant-garde varieties, and the [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]], whose chic boulevards have upscale restaurants aplenty worthy of your splurge money. The fishing quarter of Barceloneta (in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]) is an example of a neighbourhood where it pays to be picky: closer to the gentrified seafront, a slew of mojito beach bar-style places serve up expensive tourist tapas; for the real thing, head into the backstreets, where many traditional bars are still tucked away. In all cases, be prepared to \\\"promenade\\\" in search of the most attractive-looking menu; that's what the locals do, after all.\\n\\n{{infobox|Where to eat during siesta|The majority of restaurants and cafes are closed 16:00-20:00 for ''migdiada''. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:\\n* tapas in bars\\n* international chains\\n* food stands in market halls}}\\n\\n'''Set menus (men\\u00fa del migdia / men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda)''' Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a ''men\\u00fa del migdia'' / ''men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' (menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for \\u20ac12 to \\u20ac20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 14:00 to 16:00. The savvy traveller will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve ''platos combinados'', which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.\\n\\n'''Smoking''' is not permitted inside bars and restaurants since 2011, but it's usually allowed in terraces.\\n\\n===Dishes===\\n[[File:Tapas Barcelona.jpg|thumb|250px|A plate of ''tapes'']]\\n\\nYou can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.\\n\\n''See [[Catalonia#Catalan Cuisine|Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article]].''\\n\\nThe selection of '''seafood''' is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).\\n\\nA treat to try that no travel guide mentions is '''waffles''' sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\\n\\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\\n\\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of '''durum''' or '''shawarma''' stands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around \\u20ac5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the '''Asian''' selection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants, while '''Latin American''' offerings, particularly Argentine and [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], are well-represented too.\\n\\n===Food tours===\\n\\nIf you feel lost in the variety of food choices there are \\u2013 Catalan, Basque, Spanish, and beyond \\u2013 it may be helpful to do a food tour to quickly get oriented.

The following areas tend to be restaurant \\\"hubs\\\", with a large variety of restaurants to choose from:\\n* [[Barcelona/Barceloneta|Barceloneta]]: A popular quarter for locals, where you can try fish based dishes, such as ''Paella'' (a name that may hide many different kinds of rice concoctions) or ''Arr\\u00f2s negre'' (''Black Rice''), that takes its colour because it is made using squid ink. Barceloneta is a very good place to eat ''tapas'' as well.\\n* Sant Antoni is the new addition to the culinary scene in Barcelona where old and trendy cuisine mingle.\\n* Eixample Esquerra (between Gran Via and Mallorca)\\n* Barri G\\u00f2tic (especially for tapas)\\n* \\\"El Born\\\" (next to Barri G\\u00f2tic)\\n\\nAround Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya there are dozens of restaurants serving ''tapas''. One should be careful with the tourist traps as the area is highly populated with tourists.\\n\\nFor budget eating you may choose \\\"men\\u00fa del migdia\\\" in small bars on the Avinguda del Parallel for \\u20ac9-11 per person. Be aware that sometimes the menu and the staff are only in Spanish.\\n\\nThe large cafes that line the Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia and the Rambla Catalunya, just north of the Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, offer a variety of acceptable tapas.

Chupitos is Spanish for \\\"shots\\\" and offers hundreds of unique shots including the \\\"Harry Potter\\\" (a shot that sparks as cinnamon is sprinkled over it), and \\\"Monica Lewinsky\\\" (a variety of flaming shots) among others. As much a show as it is a place to get a drink, it's a fun night out.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n[[File:Hotel Vela (8698052023).jpg|thumbnail|right|The sail-shaped hotel W Barcelona is one of the city's newest landmarks]]\\n\\nBarcelona offers a great range of accommodations, from cheap, decent apartments, hostels and guest-houses to five-star hotels. Every district has plentiful offerings, and thanks to the efficient public transportation you can stay comfortably in any of them, depending on your budget and preferences.\\n\\nDuring festivals (see [[#Festivals and events|Festivals and events]] above), especially during [http://www.mobileworldcongress.com Mobile World Congress], which is a major trade show at the Fira, accommodation in Barcelona and especially near the Fira is much more difficult to find and more expensive than usual.\\n\\n* [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella#Sleep|Ciutat Vella]] offers a mix of luxury hotels and cheerful hostels within a dense urban environment.

Wi-Fi is widely available in public places and on transport.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Pickpockets===\\n\\n[[Pickpockets|Pickpocketing]] is the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona. '''Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents''' in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\\n\\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\\n* At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\\n* A milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\\n* East Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \\\"martial arts\\\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\\n* These people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\\n* Male travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\\n* In the '''subway''', a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance ''and'' exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\\n* Under no circumstances should you '''leave your items''' unattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\\n\\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can [https://denuncies.dgp.interior.gencat.cat/denuncies/ file a report online] if you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices.\\n\\n===Scams===\\n{{Seealso|Common scams}}\\n\\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\\n\\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of [[common scams#Overcharging|methods]] are employed, including the [[common scams#No-change_trick|No-change trick]]. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.\\n\\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\\n\\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\\n\\nA version of [[common scams#Three Card Monte|Three Card Monte]] is one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\\n\\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you.\\n\\n===Violent crimes===\\n\\nIn 2019 there was a surge in violent crimes around Barcelona: in just the summer, there were almost as many violent deaths as there were for the whole previous year. While tourists are only occasionally targeted (and almost exclusively simple robberies), this should be not a going concern, many of these deaths are either drug-related or take place during drunken fights, so you are best advised to avoid such situations.\\n\\n===Football===\\nLocal club '''FC Barcelona''' (also known as \\\"Bar\\u00e7a\\\", a term used by locals to refer strictly to the club and not the city) is seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and has a very heated and politically-charged rivalry with Real Madrid, which is seen as a symbol of the Spanish state and ruling establishment, and violent confrontations between the supporters of both clubs have been known to occur. Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\\n\\nFurthermore, the local ''Derbi barcelon\\u00ed'' between FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain. If you hear Bar\\u00e7a and Espanyol fans having an argument, be careful, as things can quickly escalate.\\n\\n===ATMs===\\nBarcelona offers ATMs in many locations. Many provide a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.), and most accept ATM/debit/credit cards of various banks. Choose an ATM in a secure or highly-public space (e.g., in a bank lobby or airport terminal) to avoid machines modified by criminals to skim/video your card data or where you might be robbed after use.  Ensure early in usage that the ATM supports a language you understand. For a full discussion of safe/effective charge/debit/ATM card usage and their cost trade-offs, see also [[Money]]. They will charge you a usage fee on top of anything your bank charges you which should be declared on the screen before you proceed (2,90\\u20ac for a 500\\u20ac withdrawal as of Oct. 2024 across different banks).\\n\\n===Areas of caution===\\n\\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (''cercanias'' in Spanish or ''rodalies'' in Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\\n\\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montju\\u00efc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\\n\\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\\n\\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\\n\\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\\n\\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\\n\\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.\\n\\n===Anti-tourism movement===\\n\\nMany Barcelona residents have the impression that there are too many tourists in Barcelona and that it has increased living costs, as landlords prefer to rent to tourists and not to locals to make more profit. Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024.\\n\\n===Cars===\\n\\nTourist drivers may attract special attention, such as [[common scams#Red light bag snatch|Red light bag snatch]] or [[common scams#Flat tire|Flat tire scams]]\\n\\n===Public transportation===\\n\\nBesides being a particular pickpocket hot spot, there are plenty of fare evaders who will stick to you when crossing a fare barrier. Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean ''carte blanche'' for them. The fare evasion fine is just \\u20ac50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome.\\n\\n===Reporting crimes===\\n\\nIf you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers generally do not speak English, even though the theft report form is in English, Spanish, and Catalan.

See the historical centre, the churches and cathedral, and visit many architectural works of Llu\\u00eds Dom\\u00e8nech i Montaner. Canet is the smallest town in [[Catalonia]] with many historical and modernist buildings. It also has a lot of ''blue flag'' beaches, recognised at the European level for their quality.\\n*[[Col\\u00f2nia G\\u00fcell]] \\u2014 is a tiny settlement famous for its modernist architecture.

A large part of the city, including the banks of the River Seine, is a [[UNESCO World Heritage List|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The city has the second highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants in the world (after [[Tokyo]], which is much larger) and contains numerous iconic landmarks such as the '''Eiffel Tower''', the '''Arc de Triomphe''', '''Notre-Dame de Paris''', the '''Louvre''', the '''Moulin Rouge''' and the '''Basilique du Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur''', making it one of the most popular international tourist destinations in the world, with around 14 million visitors annually. \\n\\n==Districts==\\nThe city of Paris is divided into 20 districts called ''arrondissements'', numbered from 1 to 20 in a clockwise spiral from the centre of the city (which is known as ''Kilom\\u00e8tre z\\u00e9ro'' and is located at the front of Notre Dame). ''Arrondissements'' are named according to their number. You might, for example, stay in the \\\"5th\\\", which would be written as ''5e'' in French. The 12th and 16th arrondissements include large parks: the ''Bois de Vincennes'' and the ''Bois de Boulogne'' respectively.\\n\\nThe very best map you can get for Paris is called \\\"Paris Pratique par Arrondissement\\\" which you can buy for about \\u20ac5 at any news stand.

Schematically, those to the west of Paris ([[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], [[Saint Cloud (France)|Saint Cloud]], [[Levallois]], [[Versailles]], Poissy, Rueil-Malmaison) are wealthy residential communities, even if some more middle class suburbs can be found. Those to the north are poorer communities, and very ethnically diverse. Those to the south are a mix of rough and poor neighbourhoods alongside very affluent communities. Finally, those to the east are usually lower-middle class mingled with a few upper-middle class communities.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nParis sits on the River Seine, in north-central France. Around 2.2&nbsp;million people live in the city of Paris, but this only represents the urban core within the ''Boulevard P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique''. There are some 10 million in the wider ''M\\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris'' (814 km<sup>2</sup>) and almost 13&nbsp;million people living in the metropolitan area, making this one of Europe's largest.\\n\\nDue to high expectations, a tight schedule, language barriers and large crowds and long lines at certain attractions during high season, the city might disappoint some visitors. Foreign visitors who have an idealized view of Paris might be shocked by the typical challenges of visiting any large city; crime, traffic noise, pollution, garbage, and relatively high costs. In the worst case, visitors might experience the ''Paris syndrome''; a psychological state of delusion.\\n\\nTo enjoy the wonders of Paris, make realistic plans. The amounts of attractions and landmarks is overwhelming; visiting only the most famous ones (which can be overcrowded during major holidays) takes more than a week. The city also has more to offer for people who take time for a calm stroll along the backstreets. If your time in the city is short, be selective, and save some attractions for your next visit.\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Paris je t'aime | alt= | url=https://parisjetaime.com/eng/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2024-01-30\\n| content=The website of the tourist office.\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=SPOT24 | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=101 quai Jacques Chirac, Paris 15th | lat= | long= | directions=Metro: Bir-Hakeim (line 6); RER: Champ-de-Mars\\u2014Tour Eiffel (line C); V\\u00e9lib': station 7023\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=Daily 10:00-18:00 | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2024-01-30\\n| content=The City of Paris welcome centre also has an exhibition and shop.\\n}}\\n\\n===History===\\nParis started life as the Celto-Roman settlement of ''Lutetia'' on the \\u00cele de la Cit\\u00e9, the island in the Seine now occupied by the ''Cath\\u00e9drale de Notre Dame''. It takes its present name from the name of the dominant [[Celts|Gallo-Celtic tribe]] in the region, the ''Parisii''. At least that's what [[Roman Empire|the Romans]] called them, when they showed up in 52 BCE and established their city ''Lutetia'' on the left bank of the Seine, in what is now called the \\\"Latin Quarter\\\" in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe Romans held out here for as long as anywhere else in the Western Empire, but by 508 CE they were gone, replaced by '''Clovis of the [[Franks]]''', who is considered by the French to have been their first king. Clovis' descendants, aka the Carolingians, held onto the expanded Lutetian state for nearly 500 years through Viking raids and other calamities, which finally resulted in a forced move by most of the population back to the islands which had been the centre of the original Celtic village. The Capetian Duke of Paris was voted to succeed the last of the Carolingians as [[Kingdom of France|King of France]], ensuring the city a premier position in the medieval world. Over the next several centuries Paris expanded onto the right bank into what was and is still called ''le Marais'' (The Marsh). Quite a few buildings from this time can be seen in the [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe medieval period also witnessed the founding of the Sorbonne. As the \\\"University of Paris\\\", it became one of the most important centres for learning in Europe\\u2014if not the whole world, for several hundred years. Most of the institutions that still constitute the University are found in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]], and [[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th arrondissements]].\\n\\nIn the late 18th century, there was a period of political and social upheaval in France and Europe, during which the French governmental structure, previously a monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy, underwent radical change to forms based on Enlightenment principles of nationalism, citizenship, and inalienable rights. Notable events during and following the revolution were the storming of the Bastille (in what is now the [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissement]]), and the rise and fall of Napoleonic France. Out of the violent turmoil that was the French Revolution, sparked by the still known ''Passion des Fran\\u00e7ais'', emerged the enlightened modern day France.\\n\\nThe Paris of today was built long after the Capetian and later the Bourbon Kings of France made their mark on Paris with the ''Louvre'' and the ''Palais Royal'', both in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]. In the 19th century, Baron von Hausmann set about reconstructing the city, by adding the long straight avenues and replacing many of the then existing medieval houses, with grander and more uniform buildings.\\n[[File:Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|210px|The Eiffel Tower]]\\n\\nNew wonders arrived during ''La Belle \\u00c9poque'', as the Parisian golden age of the late 19th century is known. Gustave Eiffel's famous tower, the first metro lines, most of the parks, and the streetlights (which are partly believed to have given the city its epithet \\\"the city of light\\\") all come from this period. Another source of the epithet comes from ''Ville Lumi\\u00e8re'', a reference not only to the revolutionary electrical lighting system implemented in the streets of Paris, but also to the prominence and aura of ''Enlightenment'' the city gained in that era.\\n\\nThe twentieth century was hard on Paris, but thankfully not as hard as it could have been. Both world wars took a heavy toll on the city's inhabitants, but at least Hitler's order to burn the city was ignored by the German General von Choltitz, who was quite possibly convinced by a Swedish diplomat that it would be better to surrender and be remembered as the saviour of Paris, rather than its destroyer. Following the war, the city recovered quickly at first, but slowed in the 1970s and 1980s when Paris began to experience some of the problems faced by big cities everywhere: pollution, housing shortages, and occasionally failed experiments in urban renewal.\\n\\nHowever, post-war Paris enjoyed considerable growth as a multi-cultural city, with new immigrants from all corners of the world, especially ''La Francophonie'', including most of [[North Africa|northern]] and [[West Africa|western Africa]] as well as [[Indochina]]. These immigrants brought their foods and music, both of which are of prime interest for many travellers. Immigration and multi-culturalism continues in the 21st century with a marked increase in the arrival of people from Latin America, especially [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], and [[Brazil]]. In the late 1990s, it was hard to find good Mexican food in Paris, whereas today there are dozens of possibilities from lowly ''taquerias'' in the outer ''arrondissements'' to nice sit-down restaurants on the boulevards. \\n\\nNevertheless, Paris remains a French city; bistros, baguettes, high-end fashion, art, accordions, Hausmann architecture, and all the stereotypes (whether good or bad) of France are alive and well in Paris. People from all over France flock to Paris for work, study, partying, and everything in between. After all, this IS the capital of France, so anything pertaining to France can be found here.\\n\\nThe 21st century has also seen vast improvements in the general livability of Paris, with the mayor's office concentrating on reducing pollution and improving facilities for soft forms of transportation including a huge network of cycle paths, larger pedestrian districts and new metro lines. Visitors who normally arrive car-less are the beneficiaries of these policies as much as the Parisians themselves, although tensions and doubts have emerged over the actual benefits of those measures.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Metric\\n| janhigh =   7\\n| febhigh =   9\\n| marhigh =   12\\n| aprhigh =   16\\n| mayhigh =   20\\n| junhigh =   23\\n| julhigh =   25\\n| aughigh =   25\\n| sephigh =   22\\n| octhigh =   16\\n| novhigh =   11\\n| dechigh =   7\\n| janlow =   3\\n| feblow =   3\\n| marlow =   5\\n| aprlow =   8\\n| maylow =   11\\n| junlow =   14\\n| jullow =   16\\n| auglow =   17\\n| seplow =   14\\n| octlow =   9\\n| novlow =   6\\n| declow =   4\\n| janprecip = 54\\n| febprecip = 44\\n| marprecip = 49\\n| aprprecip = 53\\n| mayprecip = 65\\n| junprecip = 55\\n| julprecip = 63\\n| augprecip = 43\\n| sepprecip = 55\\n| octprecip = 60\\n| novprecip = 52\\n| decprecip = 59\\n}}\\n\\nParis has an oceanic climate with moderately cold winters and warm summers.

There are two kinds: the regular trains, which are priced the same as the TER and the trains you'll find yourself on if you have a [[Eurail]] or [[InterRail]] pass and don't want to pay extra for reservations, and the ''trains \\u00e0 r\\u00e9servation obligatoire'', which require a reservation and are priced differently from the regular ''Intercit\\u00e9s'' trains.\\n* '''Intercit\\u00e9s de nuit''': Overnight trains from destinations to and from south of France, including [[Latour-de-Carol]], [[Lourdes]] and [[Cerb\\u00e8re]] via [[Toulouse]].\\n* '''TGV''': The world-famous French high-speed trains (''Trains \\u00e0 Grande Vitesse'') run very frequently to the southeast [[Nice]] (5-6 hr), Marseille (3 hr) and [[Avignon]] (2.5 hr), the east [[Geneva]] (3hr) or [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], [[Dijon]] (1 hr 15 min) and [[Strasbourg]] (1 hr 45 min), the southwest [[Bordeaux]] (3 hr), the west [[Rennes]] (2 hr) and the north [[Lille]] (1 hr). Thalys to Brussels (1 hr 20 min) use almost identical trains. Reservations are obligatory.\\n* '''ICE''': German [[high-speed train]]s, operating most services between Paris and [[Frankfurt]].\\n* '''Thalys''': A high-speed train service running daily to/from the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]. Though it can be a bit expensive compared to normal trains, tickets can be cheap enough if you buy in advance. On-board service is usually very good.\\n* '''Eurostar''': The Eurostar service connects Paris with [[London]] St. Pancras directly and [[Brussels]] indirectly, as well as many other destinations indirectly through the various west European rail services. Travel time between Paris Gare du Nord and [[London]] St Pancras International averages 2hr 15 min. Eurail and InterRail passes are ''not'' valid for this train, though pass holders can benefit from a reduced price. You must arrive at the station at least 90 minutes, and up to two hours, before the departure of the train to complete security and passport controls.\\n* '''[http://www.ouigo.com/ Ouigo]''': A subsidiary of SNCF running TGVs with a second class only layout intended and marketed as a lower-cost service. Strict baggage limits and 30-minute check in times make them more like budget airlines.\\n* '''Trenitalia''': Operates high-speed '''Frecciarossa''' trains between Paris, Lyon, Chamb\\u00e9ry, Modane, Turin, and Milan. Prices can be cheaper than SNCF, Trainline automatically compares both options.\\n\\n=====From Gare d'Austerlitz=====\\n* Gare d'Austerlitz \\u2013 Gare de Bercy (15 min): Bus 24 to \\u00c9cole V\\u00e9t\\u00e9rinaire de Maisons-Alfort.\\n* Gare d'Austerlitz \\u2013 Gare de l'Est (20 min): {{rint|paris|5}}, direction Bobigny.\\n* Gare d'Austerlitz \\u2013 Gare Montparnasse (25 min): {{rint|paris|10}} direction Boulogne, change at Od\\u00e9on for {{rint|paris|4}} direction Mairie de Montrouge.

Not surprisingly, traffic jams are significantly worse during French school holidays.\\n\\nThe multi-lane highway around Paris, called the ''P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'' (BP), is probably preferable to driving through the center. Another beltway nearing completion; ''L'A86'' (also {{European road|FR|A|186}} and A286) loops around Paris about 10&nbsp;km further out from the ''P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique''. A third, incomplete beltway is much further out and called ''La Francilienne'' (N104).\\n\\nIt is advised not to drive within Paris and to be wary in the metropolitan area. It is better to drive to a suburban train station with a parking lot and then use the train to continue your trip throughout Paris. Most of Paris' roads were created long before the invention of automobiles. Traffic inside the city tends to be heavy, especially at rush hour; driving, however, may be rather easy and efficient in the evening. Parking is also difficult. Furthermore, the medieval nature of parts of the city's street system makes it very confusing, and traffic will almost never allow one to stop or slow down to get one's bearings. If you are unfamiliar with the streets and still insist on driving in the city, make sure you have a navigator in the passenger seat with you. However, Paris does have several iconic boulevards that have multiple lanes, form the backbone of the city\\u2019s road network, and are useful if you do choose to bring a car \\u2014 and are tourist attractions onto themselves.\\n\\nIn Paris, there are many car rental agencies offering a large number and wide range of vehicles for rental. Additionally, there are numerous car rental agencies located off-site which provide free airport transfers from their location and may offer lower prices well.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\n=== By public transport ===\\n[[File:Navigo Easy.jpg|thumb|\\n\\nNavigo Easy Travel Card\\n\\n]]Paris has an excellent public transport system that spans every inch of the city. It is well-known for its ''M\\u00e9tro'' (short for ''Chemin de fer m\\u00e9tropolitain'', \\\"Metropolitan Railway\\\"), ''RER'' (short for ''R\\u00e9seau Express R\\u00e9gional'', \\\"Regional Express Network,\\\"), and ''Transilien'' rail networks. The M\\u00e9tro, RER and  Transilien are complemented by a large network of trams and buses.\\n\\n[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en \\u00cele-de-France Mobilit\\u00e9s] is the authority that controls and coordinates the different transport companies operating in the \\u00cele-de-France region, including Paris. The website and app can be used to plan journeys, track services, and purchase tickets.\\n\\n[https://www.ratp.fr/en RATP] operates the M\\u00e9tro, trams, buses, and about half of the RER A and B. [https://www.transilien.com/en SNCF] operates the rest of the RER, as well as the Transilien. Both companies take the same tickets, so the difference is of little interest for most people except in case of strikes. For example, RATP may strike without SNCF doing so or the other way around.\\n\\nThe M\\u00e9tro and RER move staggering numbers of people into, out of, and around Paris (6.75 million people per day on average), and most of the time in reasonable comfort. However, certain lines are operating at or near capacity, sometimes being so full that you'll have to let one or two trains pass before being able to board. If you can help it, avoid M\\u00e9tro lines 1, 4, and 13 and RER line A and B during rush hours as these are the most congested lines in the system.\\n\\nStrikes, breakdown and construction are regular occurrences on the Paris public transit system. Generally during a strike, the M\\u00e9tro operates with reduced service and some RER lines may stop operating altogether. Visit the [https://www.ratp.fr/en RATP] or [https://www.transilien.com/en SNCF] websites for information on which routes are affected. Beware that real-time traffic information and construction announcements are often available only on the French-language version.\\n\\n==== By M\\u00e9tro ====\\n[[File:Carte M\\u00e9tro de Paris.svg|thumb|250x250px|M\\u00e9tro Map]]\\nLook for the M\\u00e9tro stations, marked with a large \\\"M\\\" sign or with an old-styled sign saying \\\"M\\u00e9tropolitain\\\".\\n\\nThere are 16 M\\u00e9tro lines (''lignes'') (''1''-''14'', ''3bis'', and ''7bis'') on which trains travel all day at intervals of a few minutes. Trains usually come 2\\u20133 minutes apart during rush hour and 5\\u201310 minutes apart during other times, depending on the line. The service starts on each end of every line at 05:30, and the last metro arrives on each end at 01:15 (service ends an hour later on Friday and Saturday nights, and the day before a holiday), stopping at all stations on the line. Some lines have rare trains that terminate at an intermediate station; if that happens, get off the train with the rest of the crowd and board the next train on the same track or on the other side of the platform (the driver will usually make an announcement in French). Lines 7 and 13 have a fork, so if you take line 13 north of ''La Fourche'' or line 7 south of ''Maison Blanche'', make sure to board the train for the correct destination which is indicated by a lit arrow on the sign in the middle of the platform and on colour-coded binders in each carriage. Times for trains can be seen on an electronic scroll board above the platform. Scheduled times for first and last trains are posted in each station on the centre sign. Generally, except for early and late hours, travellers should not worry about specific Metro train times; just get to your station and take the next train.\\n\\nThe lines are named according to the names of their terminal stations (the end of the line). If you ask the locals about directions, they will answer something like: take line number ''n'' towards \\\"end station _\\\", change at \\\"station _\\\", take the line ''nn'' towards \\\"end station _\\\" etc. The lines are also colour-coded.\\n\\nChanging metro lines might be difficult at times for visitors travelling to or from the airport or train stations with heavy luggage or those with impaired mobility, especially at major metro intersections. Moving from one platform to another generally involves walking up and down multiple flights of stairs. Very few stations have elevators (only the newest line 14 is wheelchair-accessible at all stations). Only the busiest ones have escalators. It might be a good idea to check out the bus routes and timings and see if one can find a convenient bus connection.\\n\\nEach station displays a detailed map of the surrounding area with a street list and the location of buildings (monuments, schools, places of worship, etc.,) as well as exits for that particular metro. Maps are located on the platform if the station has several exits or near the exit if there is only one exit.\\n\\nExcept for M\\u00e9tro 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, and 14, the doors will not open automatically. In such a case, there are handles or buttons located both inside and outside the train that you have to push or unlatch in order to open the door. Many locals may try to squeeze into the trains after the alarm has sounded to signal the closing of the doors. While one can occasionally pass through on lines with a driver, the automatic doors on M\\u00e9tro 1 and 14 will continue to close despite the presence of a limb or article of clothing. It is strongly advised to wait for the second train than to chance being caught between the doors.\\n\\nSome larger stations have secondary entrances, where there is no ticket booth. These are labelled ''voyageurs munis de billets'' (passengers with tickets).\\n\\n==== By RER ====\\n[[File:RER A - Gare Noisiel.JPG|thumb|Information on service OKRE, last stop Torcy]]There are five commuter train lines that cross Paris: RER A, B, C, D, and E. RER trains run at intervals varying from about 3 minutes (RER A) to 6 minutes (RER D), and stop at every station '''within''' Paris. Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend.\\n\\nRER trains will stop at every station within Paris (zone 1), but may skip stations outside Paris, so if you're going to the suburbs make sure your RER stops where you need! Information about the stops to be made by the next incoming train is presented on a separate board also hanging from the ceiling.\\n\\nRER trains do not have publicly announced numbers unlike the rest of SNCF network; the four letter codes (COHI, ELAO, QYAN, VICK, etc.) take the role of the train numbers instead; the first letter indicates the station where the train terminates, and the other three indicate the route and stops. Each line has its own nomenclature. You can look up what these codes mean on information panels in the station, but the easiest and fastest way is often to check the information screens along the platforms.\\n\\n==== By Transilien ====\\nThe rest of the regional train network, called \\\"Transilien\\\", departs from the main train stations (Lyon for line R, Est for line P, Nord for lines H and K, St-Lazare for lines J and L, Montparnasse for line N) and La D\\u00e9fense (line U). Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend. The Transilien is marginally less crowded than the RER and the Metro.\\n\\n==== By tram ====\\nMost tourists will not encounter the trams as they run only on the outskirts of the city. Trams T3a & T3b go nearly three quarters of the way round the city at the edge. Tram line 7 connects Orly Airport with RER line C; it is cheap but not fast.\\n\\n==== By bus ====\\nA bus ride is interesting if you want to see more of the city. All stops have a name and are clearly marked on the street. At complex intersections, stops usually have a map that lets you know where other lines stop and if applicable where to find a M\\u00e9tro entrance. If more than one line stops, wave to the driver to let them know you want to board. All buses have a schematic map of the line on display with all stop names, bus connections and major street names. Electronic displays inside each bus tell riders its current position and what stops remain, but don't overly rely on them as they don't always work.\\n\\nSince the M\\u00e9tro is primarily structured around a hub-and-spoke model, there are some journeys for which it can be quite inefficient. In these cases it is worth seeing if a direct bus route exists, despite the complexity of the bus network.\\n\\n''Noctilien'' night buses run regularly through the central hub at Chatelet to outlying areas of greater Paris. There is also a circle line connecting the main train stations. It pays to know one's Noctilien route ahead of time in case one misses the last M\\u00e9tro home. Women travellers should probably avoid taking the Noctilien on their own to destinations outside Paris.\\n\\n==== Fares ====\\n\\nA Navigo Travel Card is required to use public transport in Paris city and the wider \\u00cele-de-France region.

Travelling without a ticket will result in you being cited and forced to pay a fine on the spot. Inspections usually take place behind the turnstiles at major metro stations or during transfers.\\n===By boat===\\n[[File:Bateaux Mouches Paris 2011.jpg|thumb|A bateau mouche near the Pont Neuf]]\\nThere are several excellent boat services which make use of the Seine. As well as providing easy, cheap transport to much of central Paris, excellent photo opportunities abound. You can buy a day or 3 day ticket and hop on and off the boat as needed. The boats take a circular route from the Eiffel Tower, down past the Louvre, Notre Dame, botanical gardens then back up the other bank past Mus\\u00e9e d'Orsay.  [http://www.batobus.com/ Batobus] offers a regular shuttle service between the main tourist sights (closed Jan); other companies such as the famous [http://www.bateaux-mouches.fr Bateaux Mouches] offer sightseeing cruises.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\n\\n{{Infobox|To stop a taxi|If the sign is green, the cab is available, if it is red, the cab is busy, if it is off, the cab is off}}\\n\\nTaxis are comparatively cheap especially at night when there are no traffic jams to be expected. There are not as many as one would expect, and sometimes finding a taxi can be challenging. In the daytime, it is not always a good idea to take a taxi, as walking or taking the metro (''See: M\\u00e9tro'') will often be faster. If you know you will need one to get to the airport, or to a meeting, it is wise to book ahead by phone.\\n\\nThe initial fare is \\u20ac2.40 and the meter increases by around \\u20ac1.10 each kilometer and around 50 cents each minute spent at red lights or in traffic jams. Fares are fixed by the city law and every driver complies with them. Fares vary according to the day of the week, the hour of the day and the area you're crossing. If you call a taxi, the meter starts when you call and not when you get in. You should expect a \\u20ac5 to \\u20ac10 fare on the meter when the taxi arrives after you call it.\\n\\n'''Remember''' if a taxi is near a 'taxi station', they're not supposed to pick you up ''except'' at the station where there may be people waiting for a taxi. Taxi stations are usually near train stations, big hotels, hospitals, and large crossings.\\n\\nThere are a number of services by which you can call for taxis or make a reservation in advance. The two largest fleet are Taxis G7 and Taxis Bleus:\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis G7 | url=http://www.taxisg7.fr | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 47 39 47 39 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis Bleus | url=http://www.taxis-bleus.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 891 70 10 10 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\nAs in many other cities a taxi can be difficult to stop; you may have to try several times. When you do get a taxi to stop, the driver will usually roll down his window to ask you where you want to go. If the driver can't (or doesn't want to) go where you want, he might tell you that he's near the end of his work day & can't possibly get you where you want before he has to go off-duty.\\n\\nThere is a \\u20ac6.40 minimum (2012) on all taxi rides, mandated by city law, but the meter does not show this amount, which can result in being asked to pay more than the metered amount on short rides. In Paris taxis are required by law to charge for the trip with a meter, charging a flat rate is illegal, except from/to Charles de Gaulle airport (\\u20ac50 from the right bank of the Seine, \\u20ac55 from the left bank) and Orly airport (\\u20ac35 from the right bank, \\u20ac30 from the left bank). Frequently the taxi driver will not want to drive you all the way to the doorstep, but will prefer to let you out a block or so away if there are one or more one-way streets to contend with. Try to look at this as a cost-savings rather than an inconvenience. You should pay while still seated in the cab as in New York and ''not'' through the front window London style. A tip is included in the fare price; If you're especially satisfied with the service, you can give something (basically 10%), but you don't ''have'' to. There is an extra charge for baggage handling.\\n\\nThe driver will not let you sit in the front seat (unless there are 3 or 4 of you, which is a rare case usually expedited by more money). Taxi-drivers come in all types, some nice, some rude, some wanting to chat, some not. Smoking in taxis is generally not allowed, however it might be that the taxi driver himself wants a cigarette in which case the rule might become flexible. Many drivers prefer that you avoid using your cellphone during the ride; if you ''do have'' to, make an apologizing gesture & sound, and do make a '''short''' call.\\n\\nIf for any reason you wish to file a complaint about a Paris taxi, take note of the taxi's number on the sticker on the left hand backseat window. Beware of illegal taxis (see the 'Stay Safe' section).\\n\\n===By car===\\n\\nIn a word: '''don't'''. It is generally a very bad idea to rent a car to visit Paris. Traffic is very dense during the day, and parking is, on average, exceedingly difficult and expensive. This is especially true in areas surrounding points of interest, since many of these are in areas designed long before automobiles existed. A majority of Parisian households do not own cars, and many people who move to the city find themselves selling their cars within a month or two.\\n\\nThat said, driving may be an option for going to some sights in the suburbs such as Vaux-le-Vicomte castle or the castle and city at [[Fontainebleau]], or for starting to other places in France. You may prefer to rent from a location outside Paris proper.\\n\\nTraffic rules in Paris are basically the same as elsewhere in France, with the exception of having to yield to incoming traffic on roundabouts. However, driving in dense traffic in Paris and suburbs during commute times, can be especially strenuous. Be prepared for traffic jams, cars changing lanes at short notice, and so on. Another issue is pedestrians, who tend to fearlessly jaywalk more in Paris than in other French cities. Be prepared for pedestrians crossing the street on red, and expect similar adventurous behaviour from cyclists. Remember that even if a pedestrian or cyclist crossed on red, if you hit him, you (in fact, your insurance) will have to bear civil responsibility for the damages, and possibly prosecution for failing to control your vehicle. Note that the speed limit in Paris is 30 km/h in almost every street, besides a few large avenues clearly marked as such. There are no stop signs in the city center.\\n\\nParis has several orbital roads. There is a series of boulevards named after Napoleonic-era generals (''Boulevard Mass\\u00e9na'', ''Boulevard Ney'', and so forth), and collectively referred to as ''boulevards des Mar\\u00e9chaux''. These are normal wide avenues, with traffic lights. Somewhat outside of these is the ''boulevard p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'', a controlled-access road with grade separation. The ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique int\\u00e9rieur'' is the inner lanes (going clockwise), the ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique ext\\u00e9rieur'' the outer lanes (going anti-clockwise). Despite the looks, the ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'' is not an ''autoroute'': the speed limit is 70 km/h and, very unusually, incoming traffic has the right of way, at least theoretically (presumably because, otherwise, nobody would be able to enter during rush hour).\\n\\n=== By chauffeur ===\\nKnown as car services or livery cabs, these cars are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares. You need to book them before they can pick you up. They are flat rate rather than metered (''ask for the fare before getting in''), and there are two types of licence: the \\\"Grande Remise\\\" that allows the car & driver to pick-up & drop-off passengers anywhere in France, and the \\\"carte verte\\\" that allows pick-up & drop-off in the department or region where the company is based. The Grande Remise cars have a GR on their front plate. They provide more service than a normal cab.\\n* Shared shuttle: You have to share the shuttle with other customers. They can be delayed since the shuttle needs to pick up other customers and perhaps drop them off before you, but they are cheaper than a private shuttle.\\n* Private shuttle: Will pick you up on-time and drop you off directly to the address specified in the booking.\\n\\n=== By motorcycle ===\\nParis is an incredibly open city, with its many \\\"Grands Boulevards\\\" and monuments with large open spaces around make it a city perfect to be explored and viewed by scooter or motorbike. Be warned that scooter/motorbike is by far the mode of transportation with the most casualties in Paris: half of victims of a collision were riding one, although they only account for about 2% of the traffic. When you're riding a scooter or motorbike in Paris, even if you see others doing so, it is not allowed to \\\"lane-split\\\" between the rows of cars waiting in traffic. At the red lights, even though a lot of scooter and motorbike drivers do not respect it, don't forget to pay attention to the bike designated area: you are not allowed to use them, and doing so is equivalent to failing to respect the red light (\\u20ac135 fine). Parking-wise there are plenty of ''deux roues'' (two wheel) parking spots all over the city. Again, even though you may see plenty of scooters or motorbikes parked on the sidewalk, it is forbidden to do so. The city of Paris has dramatically increased the number of vehicles fined every day (\\u20ac35), some of them even being towed away (at your own expenses).\\n\\n*{{do\\n| name=Paris By Scooter | url=http://parisbyscooter.com/ | email=paris@parisbyscooter.com\\n| address=(Scooter always delivered to your hotel) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 6 28 35 39 30 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=08:00-21:00 | price=From \\u20ac60\\n| content=All Vespa scooter rentals and Paris guided City tours include the collect and picked up from, your hotel in Paris.\\n}}\\n*{{listing\\n| name=Left Bank Scooters | url=http://www.leftbankscooters.com | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=Scooter delivered to your hotel\\n| phone=+33 6 78 12 04 24 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=08:00-20:00 | price=From \\u20ac60\\n| content=Scooter rental that is delivered to, and picked up from, your hotel in Paris.

Most speak English well. A simple \\\"''Bonjour Monsieur / Madame, parlez-vous anglais?''\\\" should suffice.}}\\n\\nRenting a bike is a very good alternative over driving or using public transport and an excellent way to see the sights. Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than almost any town or city in the United States. The French are very cognizant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. Paris hasn't always been the easiest place to get around by bike, but that is no longer the case. The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well, in establishing some separated bike lanes, creating a bikesharing system, and allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riverside paths which are perfect for cycling. The Paris bike network now counts over 150&nbsp;km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist. In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-hours of the day when traffic is lighter. Do remember to bring a good map, since there is no grid plan to speak of and almost all of the smaller streets are one-way.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Paris Walking 101|To get a great orientation of the city on foot while seeing many of Paris' major sights, you can do a West to East walk along the [[Axe Historique]] from the Arc de Triomphe to \\u00cele de la Cit\\u00e9 (Notre Dame). This walk takes about 1-2 hours without any stops. Start at the top of the Champs Elys\\u00e9es (at the Arc de Triomphe) and begin walking down the Champs Elys\\u00e9es towards Place ('square') de la Concorde.\\n*On the way towards the obelisk on the square, you'll see the major stores and restaurants of Paris' most famous avenue.\\n*Once you've passed the main shopping area, you'll see the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais to your right.\\n*At Place de la Concorde, you'll be able to see many of Paris' major monuments around you. In front of you is the Tuileries, behind you is the Champs-Elysees and Arc de Triomphe, behind you to your right is the Tour Eiffel and Musee d'Orsay, and finally, to your left is the Madeleine.\\n*Continue straight ahead and enter the Tuileries Gardens passing by fountains, flowers, and lovers in the park.\\n*As you continue straight ahead, and out of the garden, you'll see the pyramid entrance to the Louvre directly in front of you.\\n*With the pyramid directly in front of you, and the Tuileries directly behind you, turn to your right and walk towards the Seine.\\n*Now you can walk along the Seine (eastwards) until you reach Pont Neuf. Cross Pont Neuf and walk through the Latin Quarter, cross the river again to reach Notre Dame cathedral on Ile de la Cit\\u00e9.}}\\n\\nWhile the streets of Paris are generally fairly easy on novice cyclists, there are some streets in the city that should be avoided by those who do not have sufficient urban cycling experience. Rue de Rivoli, Place de la Bastille, and Place de la Nation are particularly hairy, especially during weekdays and the Saturday evening rush, and should not be navigated by anyone not confident in their ability to cycle in heavy traffic. Avenue des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, Place de l'\\u00c9toile, and voie Georges Pompidou (the lower-level express lanes along the banks of the Seine) should be avoided at all times.\\n\\nParis has a bike share system known as{{listing\\n| name=V\\u00e9lib' | alt= | url=https://www.velib-metropole.fr/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 76 49 12 34 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\u20ac5 per day, first half hour free\\n|wikidata=|image=| lastedit=2019-02-10\\n| content=In January 2018, the original V\\u00e9lib' was replaced by a new system called V\\u00e9lib' M\\u00e9tropole, that encompasses an ever larger area than the previous one. At first there were some technical issues, but by the end of 2018 it seems like they were mostly resolved. Bikes include a screen showing eg. how long a bike has been rented. Some electric bikes are also available (for an extra fee).\\n}} You can purchase the V\\u00e9lib pass online. An app helps finding stations and available parking slots. Green V\\u00e9lib bikes are normal bikes, blue V\\u00e9libs are ebikes.\\n\\n===By foot===\\n\\nWalking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous caf\\u00e9s and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the ''Metro'' may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.\\n\\nThe smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you'll be able to see more of the city. That said, pay attention to the M\\u00e9tro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the M\\u00e9tro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by walking along a major boulevard until you find a M\\u00e9tro station.\\n\\nYou may have heard of the hazard of walking into dog droppings in Paris. The problem is now virtually nonexistent due to fines as high as \\u20ac180 and extensive street cleaning operations.\\n\\nIt's always fun to experience the city by foot, and there are numerous walking tours around Paris, whether self-guided (with the help of a guidebook or online guide) or with a touring guide (booked through your travel agency or hotel). The city is best explored by foot, and some of the most marvelous memories you will have of Paris is walking through secret found places.\\n\\nPedestrian call buttons at crosswalks are activated by pressing the button underneath the call button box.\\n\\n==Talk==\\n\\n[[French]] (''fran\\u00e7ais'') is of course the country's official language. Any native French person will speak French and it helps if you can speak a bit of it. In the parts of the city that tourists frequent the most, the shopkeepers, information booth attendants, and other workers are likely to answer you in English, even if your French is advanced. These workers tend to deal with thousands of foreign-speaking tourists, and responding in English is often faster than repeating themselves in French. This is not the case for the rest of the city.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Reading up|Before you leave you may want to read a book like ''French or Foe'' by Polly Platt or ''Almost French'' by Sarah Turnbull \\u2014 interesting, well-written records from English-speaking people who live in France.}}\\n\\nFor most Parisians, English is something they had to study in school, and thus seems a bit of a chore. People helping you out in English are making an extra effort, sometimes a considerable one. Parisians younger than 40 are much more likely to be fluent in English. Immigrants, often working in service jobs, are less likely to speak English. If it's your first time in France you will have some problems understanding what people are saying, even with prior education in French. Unlike most language education tapes, real Parisians tend to speak fast, use slang, and swallow some letters.\\n\\nWhen attempting to speak French, do not be offended if people ask you to repeat, or seem not to understand you, as they are not acting out of snobbery. Keep your sense of humour, and if necessary, write down phrases or place names. And remember to speak slowly and clearly. Unless you have an advanced level and can at least sort of understand French movies, you should also assume that it will be difficult for people to understand what you are saying (imagine someone speaking English to you in an indiscernible accent).\\n\\nWhen in need of directions what you should do is this: find a younger person, or a person reading some book or magazine in English, who is obviously not in a hurry; say \\\"hello\\\" or \\\"''bonjour''\\\" (bon-zhor); start by asking if the person speaks English, \\\"Parlez-vous anglais?\\\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay?) even if the person can read something in English, speak slowly and clearly; write down place names if necessary. Smile a lot. Also, carry a map (preferably ''Paris par Arrondissement''); given the complexity of Paris streets it is difficult to explain how to find any particular address in any language, no matter how well you speak it. If anything, the person may have an idea as to the place you are looking for, but may not know exactly where it may be, so the map always helps.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you will probably get the cold shoulder if you stop a random person in the m\\u00e9tro, fail to greet them and say \\\"where is place X or street Y\\\".\\n\\nNow, if you speak French, remember two '''magic phrases''': \\\"Excusez-moi de vous d\\u00e9ranger\\\" [ex-kuh-zay mwuh duh voo day-rawn-ZHAY] (\\\"Sorry to bother you\\\") and \\\"Pourriez-vous m'aider?\\\" [por-EE-AY voo may-DAY] (\\\"Could you help me?\\\") especially in shops; politeness will work wonders.\\n\\nIt is considered polite to always say \\\"bonjour\\\" (during the day) or \\\"bonsoir\\\" (at night) to employees when entering any type of shop even if you have no intention of buying anything.

These include: The Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle, and the catacombs<!-- and the steps to climb to the top of the Notre Dame Cathedral-->. To avoid lines, you should start your day by arriving at one of these sites at least 30 minutes before opening time. Otherwise, expect a wait of at least an hour. Most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday. Examples: the Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while the Orsay Museum is closed on Mondays. Be sure to check museum closing dates to avoid disappointment! Also, most ticket counters close 30-45 min before final closing.\\n\\nAll national museums are open free of charge on the first Sunday of the month. However, this may mean long lines and crowded exhibits. Keep away from Paris during Easter week due to crowding. People have to queue up at the Eiffel Tower for several hours even early in the morning. However, this wait can be greatly reduced, if fit, by walking the first two levels, then buying an elevator ticket to the top. Entry to the permanent exhibitions at city-run museums is free at all times (admission is charged for temporary exhibitions).\\n\\n===Sightseeing passes===\\nOne of the best value and most convenient ways to see the sights of Paris is with the [http://www.parismuseumpass.com/en/home.php ''Paris Museum Pass'']{{Dead link|date=March 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}, a pre-paid entry card that allows entry into over 70 museums and monuments around Paris (and the Palace of Versailles) and comes in 2-day (\\u20ac62), 4-day (\\u20ac77) and 6-day (\\u20ac92) denominations (August 2024). These are ''consecutive'' days. The card allows you to jump lengthy queues, a big plus during tourist season when lines can be extensive, and is available from participating museums, tourist offices, FNAC branches and all the main M\\u00e9tro and RER train stations. You will still need to pay to enter most special exhibitions. To avoid waiting in the first long queue to purchase the museum pass, stop to purchase your pass a day or more in advance after mid-day. The pass does not become active until your first museum or site visit when you write your start date. After that, the days covered are consecutive. Do not write your start date until you are certain you will use the pass that day and be careful to use the European date style as indicated on the card: day-month-year.\\n\\nAlso consider the [http://www.parispass.com/ ''ParisPass''], a pre-paid entry card + queue jumping to 60 attractions including the Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, as well as a river cruise which allows free metro & public transport travel.\\n\\n==Do==\\n===Sports===\\n* {{do\\n| name=[[Paris/16th arrondissement#Q43605|French Open]] | alt=Roland Garros | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=48.84716 | long=2.24924 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| image=Roland Garros Stadium in 2007.jpg\\n| content=One of the 4 Tennis Grand Slam tournaments.

The busiest season is probably the fall, from a week or so after ''la rentr\\u00e9e scolaire'' or \\\"back to school\\\" to around ''No\\u00ebl'' (Christmas) theatres, cinemas and concert halls book their fullest schedule of the year.\\n\\nGood listings of current cultural events in Paris can be found in ''Pariscope'' or ''Officiel des spectacles'', weekly magazines listing all concerts, art exhibitions, films, stage plays and museums. Available from all kiosks. [https://www.timeout.com/paris/en Timeout] is a good option for tourists, who don't speak French.\\n\\nEven so, there are a couple of annual events in the winter, starting with a furniture and interior decorating trade fair called '''[http://www.maison-objet.com/ Maison & Object]''' in January.\\n\\nIn February ''le nouvel an chinois'' ('''Chinese New Year''') is celebrated in Paris as it is in every city with a significant Chinese and Vietnamese population. There are parades in the 3rd and 4th arrondissements and especially in the ''Quartier Asiatique'' (Asian Quarter) in the 13th south of Place d'Italie.

It is unmissable (not just for tourists but also French politicians wanting to appear in touch with rural France), and showcases large numbers of domestic animals as well as selling speciality food products from all over France and its former colonies in Africa. Particularly recommended are the food stalls from the overseas territories where you can try regional specialities that are hard to come by even in Metropolitan France, and they will often also have performances from folk musicians/dancers. It's usually advised to buy tickets in advance as the queues for entry can be long.\\n\\nThe first of two Fashion weeks occurs in March: '''Spring Fashion Week''', giving designers a platform to present women's ''pr\\u00eat-\\u00e0-porter'' (ready to wear) collections for the following winter.\\n\\nIn June, '''Rendez-vous au Jardin''' is an open house for many Parisian gardens, giving you a chance to meet real Parisian gardeners and see their creations. The '''[http://www.fetedelamusique.fr/ F\\u00eate de la Musique]''' celebrates the summer solstice (21 June) with this city-wide free musical knees-up. Finally on the 26th of June is the '''[http://www.gaypride.fr Gay Pride]''' parade, featuring probably the most sincere participation by the mayor's office of any such parade on the globe.\\n\\nThe French national holiday '''Bastille Day''' on the 14th of July celebrates the storming of the infamous Bastille during the French Revolution. Paris hosts several spectacular events that day of which the best known is the '''Bastille Parade''' which is held on the Champs-\\u00c9lys\\u00e9es at 10:00 and broadcast to pretty much the rest of Europe by television. The entire street will be crowded with spectators so arrive early. The '''Bastille Day Fireworks''' is an exceptional treat for travellers lucky enough to be in town on Bastille Day. The Office du Tourisme et des Congress de Paris recommends gathering in or around the ''champ de Mars'', the gardens of the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nAlso in July, '''[http://www.villette.com/ Cinema en Plein Air]{{Dead link|date=December 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}''' is the annual outdoor cinema event that takes place at the Parc de la Villette, in the [[Paris/19th arrondissement|19th]] on Europe's largest inflatable screen.

For theatre, movies and exhibitions pick up the ''Pariscope'' and ''L'officiel du Spectacle'', available at newsstands for \\u20ac0.40. For (especially smaller, alternative) concerts pick up LYLO, a small, free booklet available in some bars and at FNAC. There is no user-friendly online version of these guides.\\n\\n===Photography===\\n\\nParis is considered by many as the birthplace of photography, and while one may debate the correctness of this claim, there is no debate that Paris is today a photographer's dream. The French capital offers a spectacular array of photographic expositions and opportunities to the beginner and the pro alike. It has photogenic monuments (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, the obelisk at Concorde, and countless others); architecture (e.g., the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Museum of the Arab World) and urban street scenes (e.g., in the Marais, Montmartre and Belleville). When you tire of taking your own photos, visit one of the many institutions dedicated to photography. At these and other institutions, you can learn the about the rich history of Paris as the place of important developments in photography (e.g., the Daguerrotype) and as the home of many of the trade's great artists (e.g., Robert Doisneau, Andr\\u00e9 Kert\\u00e9sz, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson).\\n\\n* {{listing | type=do\\n| name=Maison Europ\\u00e9ene de la Photographie | alt=La MEP | url=https://www.mep-fr.org/english/ | email=\\n| address=5/7 Rue de Fourcy | lat=48.8551395| long=2.3567364| directions=Metro Saint-Paul, Pont Marie\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=W-Su 11:00-20:00 | price=Admission \\u20ac9\\n| wikipedia=/Maison_europ\\u00e9enne_de_la_photographie\\n| lastedit=2019-09-29\\n| content=Important center for contemporary photography with a large exposition area having three or four major expositions per year dedicated to contemporary photography.

Of course, like anywhere else you can see big budget first-run films from France and elsewhere. That though, is just the start. During any given week there are at least half-a-dozen film festivals going on, at which you can see the entire works of a given actor or director. Meanwhile, there are some older cult films like say, ''What's new Pussycat'' or ''Casino Royal'' which you can enjoy pretty much any day you wish.\\n\\nMany non-French movies are subtitled (called \\\"''version originale''\\\" \\\"VO\\\" or \\\"VOstfr\\\" as opposed to \\\"VF\\\" for version fran\\u00e7aise).\\n\\nThere are any number of ways to find out what's playing, but the most commonly used guide is ''Pariscope'', which you can find at newsstands for \\u20ac0.70. Meanwhile, there are innumerable online guides which have information on \\\"every\\\" cinema in Paris.\\n\\nThe [https://www.cinematheque.fr/ '''Cinemath\\u00e8que fran\\u00e7aise'''] and the [https://www.forumdesimages.fr/ '''Forum des Images'''] are the two public film institutions that organize retrospectives, exhibitions and festivals.\\n\\n===Theatres===\\nThe {{marker|type=do|name=[[Paris/9th arrondissement#Q187840|Paris Opera]]|lat=48.871944|long=2.331667|image=Paris Opera full frontal architecture, May 2009.jpg}}, as well as its associated ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet, are considered to be among the premier classical performance companies in the world.\\n\\nIf you are under 26, there is a flat rate of \\u20ac10 for every private theatre of the town every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night.

There are two separate sections for the 3-5 set and the 5-12 set. The tots section has simple exhibits designed to be pushed, prodded, and poked. The section for older kids is more sophisticated with scientific experiments and TV studios. M\\u00e9tro ''Porte de la Villete'' (7)\\n* '''Jardin du Luxembourg''' in the [[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]. It would be counted as a travesty not to take your under 10 year old to the Jardin du Luxembourg, long a favourite with Parisian children. With its world famous merry-go-round, a pond for sail boats, a puppet theater, pony rides, chess players, children's playground, it has something for every kid (with comfortable chairs for weary parents thrown in!). The marionettes du Luxembourg, the puppet theatre, stages classic French puppet shows in French but should be easy to understand. There are numerous places for a snack. RER ''Luxembourg'' (B) or M\\u00e9tro ''Od\\u00e9on'' (4, 10)\\n*'''Parc des Buttes-Chaumont''' in the [[Paris/19th arrondissement|19th]]. Buttes-Chaumont is great for those with children that like to run, climb, and explore. Built on the site of an abandoned quarry, the park is roughly bowl-shaped with a 30-meter-tall peak situated in the middle of a pond at the park's center. There are trails up the rock, caves, waterfalls, a suspension bridge, and a small stone gazebo on the top of the rock with a 360-degree view. There is also a puppet theater and a playground. M\\u00e9tro ''Buttes-Chaumont'' (7bis), ''Botzaris'' (7bis), or ''Laumi\\u00e8re'' (5)\\n* '''Parc Zoologique''' in the [[Paris/12th arrondissement|12th]]. This zoo is different because of a 236-foot artificial mountain bang in its center. Take elevators to the top and enjoy the view or watch the mountain goats do their stuff on the sides.

Unless you possess one of a number of in-demand skills, it will almost certainly be necessary to obtain a job offer from an employer before arriving. Your employer, for their part, will have to have the offer approved by the relevant governmental authorities, as well. If you opt for unreported work, such as babysitting, you need not fret about going through the process to obtain a ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'', i.e., a formal visitor's identity card. However, if you do choose a change in location, it is advisable to obtain a ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'' prior to finding any job whatsoever, as the process can be longer than expected. A ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'' is often necessary to open a bank account and the like, and by extension for accomplishing any number of other tasks involved in modern life, so unless you're very comfortable transacting everything in cash you should probably bite the bullet and keep things on the up-and-up.\\n\\nIf you go to Paris for a conference, there's a very good chance you'll end up in a meeting or exhibiting at CNIT (Centre of New Industries and Technology). This conference and convention space is one of the oldest buildings in the La Defense area of Paris and still looks modern even though it's been eclipsed in height by surrounding buildings and hotels near the CNIT are mainly catered to those staying in the area on business.\\n\\nRemember, the city of Paris has a huge network of immigrants coming and going, and it is always great to tap into that network. The city holds a great abundance of work ready to be found, even if the search feels nerve-wracking at first.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n\\nParis is one of the great '''fashion''' centres of the Western world, up there with [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], and [[Milan]], making it a shopper's delight. While the Paris fashion scene is constantly evolving, the major shopping centres tend to be the same. High end couture can be found in the 8th arrondissement. In summer, there is nothing better than browsing the boutiques along Canal St-Martin, or strolling along the impressive arcades of the historic Palais-Royal, with beautifully wrapped purchases swinging on each arm.\\n\\n'''Le Marais''' is a mostly Jewish neighbourhood, most of the shops in Le Marais are open on Sundays. The stores in this area are intimate, boutique, \\\"Parisian\\\" style clothing stores. You will no doubt find something along each street, and it is always well worth the look.\\n\\nOther great areas to shop around in are around the area '''S\\u00e8vres Babylone''' (M\\u00e9tro Line 10 and Line 12). It is in this area you will find the Le Bon March\\u00e9 [[Paris/7th arrondissement|7th]], particularly ''rue de Cherche Midi'' [[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]. The area boasts some of the major fashion houses (Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, etc.) and also has smaller private boutiques with handmade clothing.\\n\\nIn the '''Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pr\\u00e9s''', you can find a handful of vintage clothing shops, carrying anything from couture early 20th century dresses, to 70s Chanel sunglasses. Walking along ''Boulevard Saint-Germain'', you will find major brands. However, if in search of eclectic finds, opt to walk the northern side of the Boulevard, especially along '''rue Saint Andr\\u00e9 des Arts''', where you can always find a nice caf\\u00e9 to stop in. The area south of Saint-Germain is just as nice, and comes with a price tag to match.\\n\\nIn the artsy quarters of 1 and 4, there are many bargains to be had, once again, if you are prepared to look. Souvenirs are easily found and can be fairly inexpensive as long as you don't buy from the tourist sites. For cheap books of French connection, try the University/Latin quarter as they sell books in all languages starting from half a euro each.\\n\\n===Flea markets===\\nParis has 3 main flea markets, all on the outskirts of the central city. The most famous of these is the '''March\\u00e9 aux Puces de St-Ouen (Porte de Clignancourt)''' (Clignancourt Flea Market), ''M\\u00e9tro: Porte de Clignancourt'', in the [[Paris/18th arrondissement#Buy|18th]], a haven for lovers of antiques, second-hand goods, and retro fashion. The best days to go are Saturday and Sunday. There are particular times of the week when only antique collectors are allowed into the stalls, and there are also times of the day when the stall owners take their ''Parisian siesta'', and enjoy a leisurely cappuccino for an hour or so. The best times to visit the flea markets are in the spring and summertime, when the area is more vibrant. In and around the metro station, you may find the area a little wild, but still safe.\\n\\nThe [https://www.salutfromparis.com/vanves-flea-market/ '''March\\u00e9 aux Puce de Vanves'''] in the 14th arrondissement is open on Saturday and Sunday from 7h-14h. The closes metro station is Porte de Vanves.\\n\\n===Musical instruments===\\nRue de Rome, situated near Gare St. Lazare, is crowded with luthiers, brass and woodwind makers, piano sellers, and sheet music stores. Subway station Europe. The area south of the metro station Pigalle is also packed with music shops (more oriented towards guitars and drums).\\n\\n===Artwork===\\nFor art lovers, be sure to check out ''Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pr\\u00e9s'', which is renowned for its galleries, and it is impossible to turn a street without finding a gallery to cast your glance in. On Fridays, most open until late. Most even have the benefit of bottles of wine so you can wander in with your glass of wine and feel very ''artistique''. Great roads to walk along are ''rue de Seine'', ''rue Jacob'', ''rue des Beaux Arts'', ''Rue Bonaparte'', and ''Rue Mazarine''.\\nAlso, be sure to visit the historical district of ''Montparnasse'' and ''quartier Vavin'' where artists like Modigliani, Gauguin and Zadkine used to work.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n\\nParis is one of Europe's culinary centres, where the ''haute cuisine'' has flourished since at least the French revolution. It may however come as a surprise that Paris isn't considered the culinary capital of [[French cuisine]]; many people prefer the French cooking found in small rural restaurants, outside of the city, closer to the farms and with their focus on freshness and regional specialities. Even among French cities, Paris has long been considered by the French as second to [[Lyon]] for fine dining.\\n\\nThere have been other challenges in the last 20 years or so as restaurateurs in places like [[San Francisco]] and [[Sydney]] briefly surpassed their Parisian fore bearers, again with an emphasis on freshness of ingredients but also borrowings from other cuisines. Parisian cooks didn't just rest on their laurels during this time, rather they travelled, taught, and studied, and together with Paris's own immigrant communities, have revitalized the restaurant trade. Today you can find hundreds of beautiful restaurants with thoughtful (or just trendy) interior design and well-planned and executed ''cartes'' and ''menus'' offering a creative ''m\\u00e9lange'' of French and exotic foreign cuisines. It's safe to say that Paris is once again catching up with or edging ahead of its ''Anglophone'' rivals.\\n\\nOf course there are also some traditional offerings, and for the budget conscious there are hundreds of traditional bistros, with their sidewalk ''terraces'' offering a choice of fairly simple (usually meat centred) meals for reasonable prices.\\n\\nIt is unfortunately possible to have a uniformly poor dining experience during a stay in Paris, probably because mass tourism attracts price gougers. It is frequent to hear people complaining of very high Parisian prices for very poor food and service. Since so many of the restaurants are sub-par, the best approach is to rely on a restaurant guide and personal recommendations. Do your research in advance if possible and be prepared to travel some distance. Don't just walk down the street expecting to find good food; you probably won't.\\n\\nMany restaurants are tiny and have tables close together - square metres are at a premium and understandably restaurateurs need to make the most of limited space. In some cases when the restaurant is crowded, you may have to sit beside strangers at the same table. If that does not appeal to you, go to a more upscale place where you will pay for the extra space.\\n\\nTrendy restaurants often require reservations weeks, if not months in advance. If you haven't planned far enough ahead, try to get a reservation for lunch which is generally easier and less expensive.\\n\\nFor an easy-to-manage eating budget while in Paris, consider: breakfast or \\\"petit d\\u00e9jeuner\\\" at a restaurant, possibly in your hotel, consisting of some croissants, coffee, and maybe a piece of fruit. Get a 'walking lunch' from one of Paris' many food stands\\u2014a ''panino'' in the centre of the city, a crepe from a crepe stand, a felafel pita or take-out Chinese in the Marais. ''Traiteurs'' serving Chinese and/or Vietnamese food are ubiquitous in the city and good for a cheap lunch and many ''p\\u00e2tisseries'' sell inexpensive coffee and sandwiches. All these are cheap (about the same as breakfast), easy, and allow you to maximize your sightseeing and walking time while enjoying delicious local or ethnic food. For dinner, stroll the streets at dusk and consider a \\u20ac20-40 prix-fixe menu. This will get you 3 or 4 courses, possibly with wine, and an unhurried, candlelit, magical evening. If you alternate days like this with low-budget, self-guided eating (picnicking, snacking, street food) you will be satisfied without breaking the bank.\\n\\nIf one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch. Virtually all restaurants offer a good prix-fixe deal. By complementing this with a bakery breakfast and a light self-catered dinner, you will be able to experience the best of Parisian food and still stick to a budget.\\n\\n===Self-catering===\\nBudget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the [[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]] or in any other arrondissement). If your accommodation has cooking facilities you're set, especially for wine and cheese, a decent bottle of French wine will set you back all of about \\u20ac3-5, while the ''fairly good'' stuff starts at around \\u20ac7. Bottles for less than \\u20ac3 are not recommended.\\n\\nThe small ''\\u00e9piceries'' which open until late are more expensive than the ''supermarch\\u00e9s'' (Casino, Monoprix, Franprix, etc.) For wine, the price difference can be up to \\u20ac2.\\n\\nBuy a baguette, some cheese and a good bottle of wine and join the Parisian youth for a ''pique-nique'' along the Seine (especially on the \\u00cele Saint-Louis) or along the Canal Saint-Martin. The finest food stores are Lafayette Gourmet in the Galeries Lafayette or La Grande Epicerie in the luxury department store Le Bon March\\u00e9. They are worth discovering. You will find a large variety of wines there, otherwise try wine stores (cavistes) that are present everywhere in the city, and sell all kind of good French wine that you won't find in a supermarket. The owners usually know their wines and will be happy to help you choose among their huge selection. Some also sell good food. You can search for one online or ask a local. There are also some \\\"wine supermarkets\\\" such as Nicolas or Le Relais de Bacchus (all over the city) that sell more common wines.\\n\\n===Some specialities===\\n\\nFor '''seafood''' lovers, Paris is a great place to try ''moules frites'' (steamed mussels and French fries) (better in fall and winter), oysters, sea snails, and other delicacies. '''Meat''' specialties include venison (deer), boar, and other game (especially in the fall and winter hunting season), as well as French favourites such as lamb, veal, beef, and pork.\\n\\n===Prices===\\nEating out in Paris can be expensive. However don't believe people when they say you can't do Paris on the cheap - you can! The key is to stay away from the beaten tracks and the obviously expensive Champs Elys\\u00e9es. Around the lesser visited quarters especially, there are many cheap and yummy restaurants to be found. The area around Fontaine Saint-Michel, the fountain facing Notre Dame is crowded by particularly tasty places to eat, with good ambiance, cheap prices and excellent service, with the advantage of being very centric of many places of interest. The key is to order from the prix-fixe menu, and ''not'' off the A la Carte menu unless you want to pay an arm and a leg. In many places a three course meal can be found for about \\u20ac15. This way you can sample the food cheaply and is usually more \\\"French\\\". Ask for \\\"une carafe d'eau\\\" (oon karaaf doe) to get free tap water.\\n\\n===Kosher dining===\\nParis has the largest number of Kosher restaurants in any European city. Walk up and down Rue des Rosiers to see the variety and choices available from Israeli, Sushi, Italian and others. You will also find a wide assortment of Kosher restaurants in the 9th arrondissement of Paris near the rue Richer and rue Cadet areas. See the district guides for examples. Kosher restaurants and snacks usually display a big orange rectangle on their front, which ensure clients that they are Beth din certified.\\n\\n===Vegetarian dining===\\n<!-- please put individual restaurant listings in the appropriate arrondissement page -->\\n\\nFor '''vegetarians''', eating traditional French food will require some improvisation, as it is heavily meat-based. That being said, it is far easier to be vegetarian in Paris than it is elsewhere in France. Paris has several excellent vegetarian restaurants, and many non-vegetarian restaurants will provide vegetarian dishes. \\n\\nWhen eating in a traditional restaurant, be careful before ordering dishes labelled as \\\"vegetarian\\\". Many French people presume that ''fish'' and ''seafood'' are vegetarian dishes. This is a widely spread misunderstanding all around the country. Additionally, French people tend to confuse \\\"real\\\" vegetarians with vegans. When explaining that you're a vegetarian that won't eat fish, people will often presume that you don't eat milk or egg-based products.\\n\\nLook for spots such as Le Grenier de Notre-Dame in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]'''. The '''[[Paris/10th arrondissement|10th]]''' arrondissement also has quite a large variety of vegetarian restaurants, especially of Indian and East/South-East Asian fare. See the arrondissement pages for more listings. For fast food and snacks, you can always find a vegetarian sandwich or pizza, or indeed French tacos. Even a kebab shop can make you something with just cheese and salad, or perhaps falafel. And for healthier fare, it's not usually hard nowadays to find hipstery places that sell vegan poke bowls.\\n\\nThere are also lots of Italian, Thai, Indian, and Mezo-American places where you will have little problem. The famous South Indian chain Saravana Bhavan have their branch near Gare Du Nord. In Rue des Rosiers (4th arrondissement) you can get delicious falafel in the many Jewish restaurants. Another place to look for falafel is on Rue Oberkampf (11th arrondissement). Take away falafel usually goes for \\u20ac5 or less.\\n\\nMoroccan and Algerian cooking is common in Paris - vegetarian couscous is lovely. Another good option for vegetarians - are traiteurs, particularly around Ledru Rollin (down the road from Bastille) take away food where you can combine a range of different options such as pomme dauphinoise, dolmas, salads, vegetables, nice breads and cheeses and so on.\\n\\nLebanese restaurants and snack shops abound as well, offering a number of vegetarian ''mezze'', or small plates. The stand-bys of course are hummas, falafel, and baba-ganouche (''caviar d'aubergine''). A good place to look for Lebanese is in the pedestrian zone around Les Halles and Beaubourg in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]] and [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]].\\n\\nAlso look out for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) places, especially around Rue Mouffetard in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]''', where you can often get a tofu banh mi for less than a fiver.\\n\\n===Tourists and locals===\\n\\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually geared towards tourists. It does make a difference in the staff's service and behaviour whether they expect you to return or not.\\n\\nSometimes the advertised fixed price tourist menus (\\u20ac10-15) are a good deal. If you're interested in the really good and more authentic stuff (and if you have learned some words of French) try one of the small bistros where the French go during lunch time.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n\\nThe bars scene in Paris really does have something for everyone. From bars which serve drinks in baby bottles, to ultra luxe clubs that require some name dropping, or card (black Amex) showing, and clubs where you can dance like no one's watching, (although they will be). To start your night out right, grab a drink or two in a ubiquitous dive bar, before burning up the dance floor and spreading some cash, at one of the trendy clubs.\\n\\n*'''Canal St Martin'''. Many cozy caf\\u00e9s and other drinking establishments abound around the ''Canal St Martin'' in the '''[[Paris/10th arrondissement|10th]]'''.\\n*'''The Marais'''. The Marais has a large number of trendier new bars mostly in the '''[[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]]''' and to a lesser extent the '''[[Paris/3rd arrondissement|3rd]]''' with a few old charmers tossed into the mix. A number of bars and restaurants in the Marais have a decidedly gay crowd, but are usually perfectly friendly to straights as well. Some seem to be more specifically aimed at up-and-coming hetero singles.\\n*'''Bastille'''. There is a very active nightlife zone just to the northeast of Place de Bastille centered around ''rue de Lappe'', ''rue de la Roquette'', ''rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine'' (especially the amazing Club Barrio Latino) and ''rue de Charonne'' in the '''[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]'''. Many of the bars closest to Bastille have either a North, Central, or South American theme, with a couple of Aussie places mixed in for good measure, and as you continue up ''rue de Charonne'' the caf\\u00e9s have more of a traditionally French but grungy feeling.\\n*'''Quartier Latin - Odeon'''. If you're looking for the ''nouvelle vague'' (new wave) style, student and intellectual atmosphere of Paris in the 1960s and 70s, you'll find a lot of that (and more hip and chic) places in the quartier Latin and between place Odeon and the Seine. The neighbourhood is also home of many small artsy cinemas showing non-mainstream films and classics (check 'Pariscope' or 'l'officiel du spectacle' at any newspaper stand for the weekly programme).\\n*'''Rue Mouffetard and environs'''. The area in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]''' on the south side of the hill topped by the Panth\\u00e9on has a little bit of everything for the nighthawk, from the classy caf\\u00e9s of Place de la Contrescarpe to an Irish-American dive bar just down the way to a hip, nearly hidden jazz caf\\u00e9 at the bottom of the hill.\\n*'''Ch\\u00e2telet'''. In some ways the ''Marais'' starts here in the '''[[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]''' between ''Les Halles'' and ''H\\u00f4tel de Ville'' but with between all of the tourists and the '''venerable Jazz clubs''' on ''rue des Lombards'' the area deserves some special attention.\\n*'''Montmartre'''. You'll find any number of cozy caf\\u00e9s and other drinking establishments all around the ''Butte Montmartre'' in the '''[[Paris/18th arrondissement|18th]]''', especially check out ''rue des Abbesses'' near the ''M\\u00e9tro'' station of the same name.\\n*'''Oberkampf-M\\u00e9nilmontant'''. If you are wondering where to find the hipsters (''bobos'' for bohemian-bourgeois), then this is where to look. There are ''several'' clusters of grungy-hip bars all along ''rue Oberkampf'' in the '''[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]''', and stretching well into the '''[[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]]''' up the hill on ''rue de M\\u00e9nilmontant''. It's almost like being in [[San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco/Haight-Fillmore District|Haight-Fillmore]] district.\\n*'''Bagnolet'''. There are a cluster of bar/restaurant/nightclubs along the southern end of the P\\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in the [[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]] including probably the best place in Paris for nightly local and touring punk rock.\\n*'''Rues des Dames-Batignolles'''. Another good place to find the grungy-chic crowd is the northern end of the '''[[Paris/17th arrondissement|17th]]''' around ''rue des Dames'' and ''rue des Batignolles'', and if you decide you want something a little different Montmartre is just around the corner.\\n*'''Port de Tolbiac'''. This previously deserted stretch of the river Seine in the '''[[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th]]''' was reborn as a center for nightlife (and Sunday-afternoon-life) a few years ago when an electronic music cooperative opened the '''Batofar'''. Nowadays there are a number of boats moored along the same ''quai'', including a boat with a Caribbean theme, and one with an Indian restaurant.\\n*'''Saint Germain des Pr\\u00e9s'''. This area has two of the most famous caf\\u00e9s in the world: Caf\\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots, both catering to the tourists and the snobs who can afford their high prices. This part of the '''[[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]''' is where the Parisian caf\\u00e9 scene really started, and there still are hundreds of places to pull up to a table, order a glass, and discuss Sartre deep into the evening.\\n\\nFor individual bar listings see the various Arrondissement pages under '''Drink'''.\\n\\nOf course there are lots of interesting places which are sort of off on their own outside of these clusters, including a few like the '''Hemingway Bar at the Ritz''' which are not to be missed in a serious roundup of Parisian drinking, so check out the listings even in those arrondissements we haven't mentioned above.\\n\\nSome nightclubs in Paris that are worth it: Folies Pigalle (pl. Pigalle, 18th, very trashy, \\u20ac20), Rex Club (near one of the oldest cinemas on earth, the Grand Rex, house/electro, about \\u20ac15). You might also want to try Cabaret (Palais Royal), Maison Blanche, le Baron (M Alma-Marceau). Remember when going out to dress to impress, you are in Paris! Torn clothing and sneakers are not accepted. The better you look, the more likely you will get past the random decisions of club bouncers. Also important to remember if male (or in a group of guys) that it will be more difficult to enter clubs; try to always have an equal male/female ratio.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n=== Hotels ===\\nBeing often declared the most popular travel destination in the world, Paris has far over a thousand hotels to choose from, and even more in the surrounding [[Ile-de-France]] region. The choice may be overwhelming, but should be made carefully. There are huge differences in standards and location is key to make your stay in Paris enjoyable and time used well. Be prepared to pay the price for Paris' popularity - even the cheap hotels are relatively expensive.\\n\\nDespite the popularity with tourists, global hotel chains have relatively low penetration of the Parisian market. A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered. There is a fair amount of Best Westerns as well, but most international chains limit their presence to very few exclusive (and expensive) hotels in key locations. Travellers loyal to a particular brand may find their loyalty challenged, be forced to pay for it (rather than be rewarded) or unable to find their hotel brand of choice in Paris.\\n\\nHotels in the central arrondissements tend to be expensive, although very cheap ones can also be found. With few exceptions, they tend to offer small rooms - be aware of the fact that the difference in price between hotels can translate into difference in service, facility and appointment levels, but not necessarily room size. Rooms of 12-16 square metres (which is roughly half of standard hotels rooms e.g. in the USA) are the norm in central Paris, regardless of hotel standards.\\n\\nCheaper hotels in popular arrondissements tend to be older, less attractive properties, whose facilities and appointments may be very worn and outdated, far behind standards one would expect from the capital of all things pretty and fine. Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.\\n\\nHotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the ''Peripherique'' and Paris itself, can be far cheaper and better value for money than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, you should check thoroughly how far from the metro / RER station the given hotel is, and whether the connection to the POIs you want to visit is direct, quick and easy. Do also factor in the added cost of transportation to outer zones, as well as the time spent to travel to and from the city and obviously resulting limitations.\\n\\nBecause of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called \\\"''douche italienne''\\\" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.\\n\\nParis hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low seasons. These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around the Christmas season.\\n\\nFor individual hotel listings see the various [[#Districts|Arrondissement]] pages. <!-- please add individual hotel listings on the various Arrondissement pages -->\\n\\n=== Apartment rentals ===\\nFor those staying for a week or more, renting a furnished apartment might be a more comfortable and money-saving option, especially for 3 or more adults. Furnished apartments can differ considerably in location and quality, offer different accommodations and selections of appliances and kitchen features, or may be well-above street level with no elevator. Expect apartment sizes to be modest. Access to local public transport can also vary widely. So choose carefully only after getting a full description of an interesting property.\\n\\nMany websites will help you find rentals. Some do a more disciplined job of locating and describing properties and their locale. Most charge a commission of 10% or more; some offer insurance covering some risks. Some may offer a few apartments for shorter stays, usually at somewhat higher cost per day.\\n\\nIn late-spring and summer months, desirable properties may be in short supply. If your plans are fairly firm for those periods, you would be wise to \\\"reserve\\\" a unit well in-advance. Owners will often ask for a non-refundable deposit of up to 50% of the total cost of your stay. Means of payment can range from money order to PayPal or (occasionally) charge card. (Take great care of how and with whom you share any charge card account number.) You should send no payment to any post office box or similarly anonymous place or account...even after exchanging e-mails with a purported owner; most are no more than \\\"blind\\\" scams to take your money.\\n\\nThe city government has passed ordinances that require owners renting properties for short periods to collect a tax previously collected only by hotels. This substantial tax may not be collected by some owners, or may be demanded by them but not mentioned in their rates until you arrive. Tax enforcement and collection remain in a state of flux.\\n\\nSome agencies, rental brokers or web sites, that seem amicable, attractive or claim reputations, do not abide by French law to carefully vet and select landlords and apartments they offer for rent. There are a certain number of guarantees, which are required in France before renting an apartment, and an insurance policy, which aims at protecting the tenants during their stay.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Crime===\\nDespite what many naysayers might say or believe, Paris is still a relatively safe city. This does not stop it from being plagued by petty [[crime]], especially [[pickpocketing]], and muggings. Scams, of which there are many, are also prevalent, though the police are slowly cracking down on them. While not common, purse snatchings do happen. Violent crime is rare. However, watch yourself at ATMs and other places where your cash may be visible. Keep your money and your wallet in your front pockets, and avoid ATMs that are open to the outside, especially at night.\\n\\nAs a densely populated city with equally dense neighbourhoods, one would be remiss to generalise the safety of entire 'arrondissements' based on a few specific areas. Several arrondissements have their share of crime, however. The 18th, 19th, and 20th arrondissements are widely seen as the least safe areas of Paris, but safety levels vary dramatically from street to street. During the day, they're usually fine; you might have to watch out for pickpockets and scammers, but not much more. However, be on your guard at night. The 10th arrondissement (namely the areas bordering the 18th and 19th arrondissements) and the southeastern portion of the \\\"p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique\\\" have also gained a reputation for being sketchy.\\n\\nSeveral of the inner suburbs of the metropolitan area (commonly referred to as the ''banlieues'') such as La Courneuve, [[Saint-Denis (\\u00cele-de-France)|Saint-Denis]], Sarcelles, and Pantin are notoriously 'rough' by European standards, and you should be cautious when visiting these places. Unrest in those areas has made global headline news (as did the somewhat heavy-handed reactions of various French governments).\\n\\nThe police can be reached by phone by dialling 17. Not all police officers speak English, but those found around touristy areas almost always will. They are usually friendly and perfectly approachable should you have to.\\n\\n==== Theft in public transit ====\\nThe m\\u00e9tro and RER are also a popular place for pickpockets. '''Hold things tightly and be aware of your surroundings.''' While trains are usually crowded, if someone is insisting and hovers over you, they are probably going through your pockets. It is important to know that a majority of these belong to a gang. These gangs usually use young children as young as seven, with groups of them going around the metro stations pickpocketing tourists and locals alike. If there is a group of three or more suspicious looking people, be careful of your belongings. This is a notable occurrence on M\\u00e9tro line 13, tramways, and the RER B.\\n\\nCommon tactics are two of them blocking you as you try to board the subway, with two behind you quickly going through your bag. Seconds before the doors close, the two jump off, leaving you on the metro without even realizing what has happened. Take note of what locals do. If someone warns you to be careful, there are probably some suspicious types hoping to steal from you. Also be aware that phone-snatching is the most reported crime, and avoid using your cellphone on metro platforms and in the metro itself.\\n\\nPickpockets are active on the rail link (RER B) from Charles de Gaulle airport to downtown Paris, which passes through the poor suburbs of Seine-Saint Denis. Try to take the trains which are nonstop between the airport and Paris proper (Gare du Nord) - EKLI/EKIL from Paris to CDG and KRIN/KROL from CDG to Paris. These are faster and are less crowded than the alternative.\\n\\nThere have also been problems with thieves physically fighting people in order to steal their belongings. The most common targets are those with suitcases and backpacks, i.e. tourists. Thieves usually coin their acts with the closing of the doors. Newer trains have cameras everywhere, and thieves are much less likely to use them. Otherwise, stow luggage on the racks above the seat (which is not possible in newer trains) and hold on to your bags so no one can grab them and then run out. You are much less likely of being a victim if the train is crowded with locals headed to work, usually at rush hour.\\n\\nThe train conductors are widely aware of these crimes and will usually wait a few seconds to leave the station after the doors have closed, just in case thieves have quickly jumped off with belongings. There are also emergency cords that one can pull if willing to chase after the attackers. People will usually be helpful and gladly call the police if you do not have a cell phone.\\n\\n==== Theft in tourist hotspots ====\\nPickpockets are most likely to be found working at crowded tourists hotspots, so keep your wallet and phone in your front pockets and hold your backpack tightly when in a crowd.\\n\\nA common place for phone/camera/wallet snatching is in tourist friendly dining areas scattered all over Paris where exposed outdoor tables are commonly right on busy sidewalks. Common practice by many Western tourists is to leave an aforementioned item of value on the table (most commonly a smartphone) in front of them. Some of the criminals, working in groups of three to five people, approach your table and shove what appears to be a survey directly under your nose thus blocking your view of your valuable. While the gang members are yelling in a foreign language another one will slip a hand below your view and take your item of value from the table. This occurs very quickly (less than five seconds) and the perpetrators disappear around the corner just as quick as they arrived.\\n\\nKey landmarks like the Louvre or the Eiffel tower have been plagued with gangs of pickpockets, which typically operate in groups of about five. As many as half a dozen of these gangs may be active at a particularly famous, crowded venue at any one time; occasionally there are fights between rival gangs of thieves. Asian visitors are often targeted due to a presumption that they are visiting from affluent nations. Venue staff have complained of being spat at, threatened, abused or assaulted by pickpocketing gangs; the Louvre closed briefly in 2013 (as did the Eiffel tower in 2015) due to worker protests of unsafe conditions due to criminal activity. Token attempts to deploy more police have not solved the problems.<!-- http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32844573 -->\\n\\n==== Scams ====\\n[[File:People at Montmartre \\\"selling\\\" trinkets.JPG|right|thumb|The men who will try to tie strings on your fingers]]\\nAt Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur, there are many men who will try to tie strings or bracelets on your finger (often called \\\"string muggers\\\"). Not only will they demand an obscene fee for the cheap trinkets (usually over \\u20ac15), they will also try to pickpocket you or threaten you with force if you do not give them money. They are usually only at the base of the monument and can be avoided by taking the Funicular of Montmartre. Otherwise, you can quickly walk past them and ignore them, though they will readily grab people's arms and have even been known to target children of tourists. Yelling at them may cause unwanted attention and cause them to back off, but be careful. Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur appears to be the only area where they congregate, but they have been sighted also near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nBesides them, you will notice many people walking around with cheap trinkets at touristy areas, especially the Trocad\\u00e9ro, Eiffel Tower, and Louvre Museum. They are generally not rude, but buying things from them is illegal and hurts small businesses. Of course, they bolt at the sight of the police, and you may end up in the middle of a stampede!\\n\\nBe careful around Barb\\u00e8s-Rochechouart and the bars near Moulin Rouge. A very common [[clip joint]] trick is played here which might cost you up to \\u20ac500. The agents standing outside will force you to enter a bar and just have a look for 5 minutes. The moment you order a drink (about \\u20ac5), a girl will approach you and start talking generally, and leave in 10\\u201315 minutes. After a harmless conversation with the girls when you request a bill, you will encounter a charge of say \\u20ac200-500 as 'service fees' for the services rendered by the girl! In case you resist paying, the bouncers will start intimidating you to try to extract money from your wallet. In such cases, threaten them that you are calling the police and informing the local embassy. Try to buy some time and start creating a ruckus. However, do not try to start a fight with the bouncers. This trick is common to many European big cities.\\n\\nOne scam involves a \\\"helpful\\\" local buying a ticket for you. Normally, tourists buy 1-day, 3-day or longer Paris Visite passes. They would tell you that your single trip ticket has expired and bring you to the ticketing machine to purchase day passes. Then they would select the 3 day pass for adults (even though you may be a student) and deliberately show you the price on the screen. Everything else is in French so you would not understand a thing. They would proceed to purchase with a credit card and while entering the PIN code, get you to turn your back on them. They then sneakily change the ticket to a single trip ticket and ask for payment for a 3-day ticket from you. Unsuspecting tourists would pay the full sum thinking it is a 1-day or 3-day pass when it is only a useless ticket. Buy the tickets yourself to avoid situations like these, as machines are available in English and other languages. If you feel threatened, call the police and don't physically handle the ticket if they forcibly purchase without your agreement.\\n\\nAnother common scam is found along the banks of the Seine river and involves a ring. This involves thieves \\\"finding\\\" a ring which they give to you. They then ask you if you own it. When you say no, they insist you keep it, saying it goes against their religion or they cannot wear rings. A few moments later, they ask you for money to buy something to eat, eventually following you and becoming more annoying. You can either yell at them or steer them towards an area where there are likely to be police present, at which point they will quickly run away.\\n\\nThe most common scam (besides pickpocketing) that has taken over Paris by storm since June 2011 involves women coming up to tourists with pledge sheets. They pretend to be deaf people collecting money for one charity or another. Once you are distracted with the petition, an accomplice pickpockets you and takes your belongings. In addition, once you sign, they point to a thing that reads \\\"minimum ten euro donation.\\\" While they may at first insist on this, shaking your head and walking away will usually make them pester someone else. Otherwise, simply waving them off and a loud no should make them give up. If they are in a large group, as is common, be careful of your belongings! This is a ploy to pickpocket you as you are surrounded by them. At this point, yelling for the police will make them disperse quickly. This is most commonly found around major tourist sites, but has also been a problem at Gare du Nord, though this has gotten much better.\\n\\nNever bet money on a 3-card game as you will always lose. This trick is played by con artists on some of the bridges on River Seine near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nA more modern scam takes place on ride-sharing apps such as Bolt. The \\\"driver\\\" will send you a message, saying you need to provide your mobile number in order to \\\"confirm\\\" the booking (this is not true; no such rule exists). Once you have done so, they will then attempt to use your number to sign into an account on another app (such as Uber), and send you another message on the first app requesting your confirmation code (which you will have received in a text message from the second app after you gave out your number). They will use another made-up excuse (\\\"Uber now runs Bolt operations in Paris\\\") to talk you into doing this. If the scam is a success, they will have access your account, and can run up massive bills by booking rides in your name. As such, if you receive such a message, do not engage, just cancel the ride and report the driver as a scammer. The app should then refund your cancellation fee. \\n\\nIt is a good idea to steer clear of the suburb of Seine Saint-Denis, as this suburb is known for its gangs and poverty, though there is little of interest to tourists anyway (except the Basilique de Saint-Denis, but that is located near a m\\u00e9tro station). You may want to avoid walking alone at night in the 18th and 19th arrondissements as well, as these can be a little shady at night. There is a large problem with youths from the depressed suburbs causing trouble with the police. If locals are moving away, it is most likely from a confrontation. While these groups rarely target people besides the police, be careful. Walk away from a situation that could lead to fights or worse.\\n\\nIn general, remember to be aware of pickpockets, as they act by trying to distract you. Avoid showing off expensive phones or a lot of money in public transportation or in open areas. Put your things in a money belt or your front pockets, but never in the back pockets.\\n\\n====Danger for identifiably Jewish people====\\nParis has the largest Jewish community in Europe and the 6th largest in the world. However, antisemitic acts have increased in France since the early 2000s, culminating with the January 2015 \\u00cele-de-France attacks targeting a local kosher supermarket. Attacks on Jews have since decreased and as of 2023, there have been no recent reports of attacks against tourists of Jewish faith. After 2015, the French government assigned thousands of soldiers to guard synagogues and Jewish schools. Still, fearing harassment or attacks, many of the local Jews no longer wear a kippa/yarmulke in the street or public transportation. So consider taking the advice of local Jews regarding your behavior. For example, if you wear a kippa, consider wearing it under a hat that is not identifiably Jewish.\\n\\n==Respect==\\n\\nParisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant. While this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris still is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is \\\"''bien \\u00e9lev\\u00e9''\\\" (well brought up). It will make getting about considerably easier.\\n\\nParisians' abrupt exteriors will rapidly evaporate if you display some basic courtesies. A simple \\\"''Bonjour, Madame''\\\" when entering a shop, for example, or \\\"''Excusez-moi''\\\" when trying to get someone's attention, are very important; say \\\"''Pardon''\\\" or better \\\"''je suis d\\u00e9sol\\u00e9''\\\" if you bump into someone accidentally or make other mistakes. If you speak French or are using a phrasebook remember to always use the vous form when addressing someone you don't know; this may transform the surliest shop assistant into a smiling helper or the grumpiest inhabitant to a helpful citizen. Courtesy is extremely important in France (where the worst insult is to call someone \\\"''mal \\u00e9lev\\u00e9''\\\", or \\\"badly brought up\\\").\\n\\nIf you only learn one long phrase in French a good one would be \\\"''Excusez-moi de vous d\\u00e9ranger, monsieur/madame, auriez-vous la gentillesse de m'aider?''\\\" (pardon me for bothering you, sir/madam, would you have the kindness to help me?) - this level of extreme politeness is about the closest one can come to a magic wand for unlocking Parisian hospitality. If you know some French, try it! But remember, too, that Parisians have places to go and things to do, so if they have no time and don't answer you, don't take it personally. Many Parisians, given time, will go out of their way to help, especially if you make an effort to speak their language and act polite to them.\\n\\nMost foreigners tend to ignore two basic rules of courtesy in metro and train transport in Paris. If the carriage is full and you're sitting on a folding seat, you should consider standing up. If you stand next to the door, you are expected to get down to the platform at a stop so that people inside can find their way out.  Once they have got out, you can go back. However, don't always expect that others will do the same for you and, if the train is full, get ready to get down with enough time in advance. In a corridor, when pushing a door, you are expected to hold it for the next person, so that it won't close abruptly. This rule is strictly observed in the metro, and quite commonly everywhere else.\\n\\nIn addition, if you are traveling to or from the airport or train station and have luggage with you, make certain that you are not blocking the aisles in the train by leaving your bags on the floor. The RER B (which links both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports to the city) has luggage racks above the seats (on the newer trains, there are no such racks above the seats, but racks dedicated to luggage in between some seats); it is best to use them so you do not block the path of a local who is getting off the train before the airport stop. On the m\\u00e9tro and especially in the RER, don't take up extra seats with your luggage. There are luggage racks and spaces between the seats.\\n\\nThere are hefty fines for littering in Paris, especially with dog droppings (often you'll find free plastic bag dispensers around parks or playgrounds).\\n\\n==Connect==\\nAs of Sept 2021, Paris has 5G from all French carriers. Wifi is widely available in public places, transport, cafes and so on.\\n\\nOne helpful thing about having official and numbered districts in Paris is that you can easily tell which arrondissement an address is in by its postal code, and can easily come up with the postal code for a Paris address if you know its arrondissement. The rule is just pre-pend 750 or 7500 to the front of the arrondissement number, with 75001 being the postal code for the 1st and 75011 being the postal code for the 11th, and so on. The 16th has two postal codes, 75016 for the portion south of Rue de Passy and 75116 to the north; all other arrondissements only have one postal code.\\n\\nPhone cards are available from most \\\"tabacs\\\" but make sure you know where you can use them when you buy them, as some places still sell the ''cartes cabines'' which are hard to use as ''cabines'' are rare.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\nFamous for its status as \\\"fashion capital\\\", Paris isn't as conservative in dress as one might think. Parisians will tolerate all kinds of clothes as long as they're worn \\\"avec style\\\" (with style). That's why men do not usually wear shorts shorter than above the knee outside of sporting events: it is not considered indecent but may stand out from the locals; shorts are for \\\"schoolboys and football players\\\" only.\\n\\n===Airlines===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Adria Airways | url=http://www.adria.si | email=\\n| address=94 r Saint Lazare 75009 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= |

Built by Gustave Eiffel in 1887-1889, the tower was almost torn down in 1909 and only saved due to its use as a telegraphy antenna. The queues can be very long. The tower allows online reservations at its website. You can select a date and time frame. If you miss the time on your ticket, you have lost your money. The north, west, and east pillars have elevators that go to the first and second floors; the south pillar has stairs that can be climbed to the second floor. To reach the top floor, an additional elevator ride is required, and the wait for this can be very long as well. Disabled visitors are not allowed beyond the second floor due to safety concerns. Taking the M\\u00e9tro as far as Ecole Militiare and then strolling up the Champ de Mars is a lovely way to arrive at the tower. Another phenomenal approach is to exit the Metro at Trocadero and see the Eiffel Tower from the other side of the Ecole Militaire.\\n}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=l'Assembl\\u00e9e Nationale | alt= | url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/ | email=\\n| address=33, quai d'Orsay | lat=48.862192 | long=2.318716 | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 40 63 60 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=M F Sa 08:40-11:40 and 14:00-17:00 | price=\\n| wikipedia=National Assembly (France) | image=Paris Assemblee Nationale DSC00074.jpg | wikidata=Q193582\\n| content=Guided tours conducted all day, ID required.

You must '''never be complacent''' about the chances of having your items stolen, as thieves will usually operate in a manner that leaves the victim with no idea that they have lost their possessions until it is too late.

Quite up-market and quiet, it is the largest arrondissement by both area and population. Housing over 230,000 inhabitants and providing around 150,000 jobs, it is dense with residential and office developments, including the high rise skyline of ''Front de Seine'' along the northern part of the 15th's bank of the river. On the other hand, it sees relatively little tourist traffic \\u2014 but that does not mean it is devoid of attractions.\\n\\nThe famous skyscraper ''Tour Montparnasse'' and the neighbouring railway station ''Gare Montparnasse'' are on the eastern border of the 15th arrondissement, although the actual district of ''Montparnasse'' is right across the border in the [[Paris/14th arrondissement|14th arrondissement]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Paris 15e arrondissement - Quartiers.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|The four administrative quarters of the 15th arrondissement]]\\nThe 15th arrondissement is further broken up administratively into four ''quartiers'': Grenelle, Necker, Saint-Lambert and Javel.\\n\\n'''Grenelle''' is the quarter closest to the [[Paris/7th arrondissement|7th arrondissement]] and thus directly neighbouring the ''Champ de Mars'' and the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, it houses many hotels advertising the proximity of the Tower. The waterfront part of Grenelle is home to the 1970s high-rise residential development of ''Beaugrenelle'', and the eponymous shopping mall. The more inland parts of the quarter are filled with 19th-century ''Haussmannian'' buildings, interspersed with some more modern ones.\\n\\nThe quarter of '''Necker''', situated between Grenelle and the quarter of ''Montparnasse'' of the [[Paris/14th arrondissement|14th arrondissement]], is home to some of the locations named after Montparnasse, most notably the ''Tour Montparnasse'' and ''Gare Montparnasse''. It also houses more large public service and commercial buildings, such as the expansive ''H\\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades''. Otherwise, it is full of late 20th-century residential buildings, with many fewer Haussmannian structures than Grenelle.\\n\\nThe southeast quarter of '''Saint-Lambert''' is most known for the ''Parc des expositions de la porte de Versailles'', which is one of the largest and most important exhibition centres in France and Europe.\\n\\nThe southwestern '''quartier Javel''' had long been an industrial area of Paris, but has been reclaimed as office, residential, and recreational over the decades. It contains the ''Parc Andr\\u00e9 Citro\\u00ebn'', created over the former Citro\\u00ebn factory grounds, and the Heliport of Paris in its southern extremity.<!--The 15th, the largest arrondissement of central Paris, remains heavily residential, up-market and quiet - not a great deal of obvious attractions for the traveller here, apart from the Montparnasse Tower (Tour Montparnasse). Some parts of the arrondissement are close to the Eiffel Tower which actually is in the 7th. Other sights include the Montparnasse Cemetery where Jean-Paul Sartre and Charles Baudelaire are buried, Theatre de la Gaite, and Theatre du Montparnasse. Montparnasse Station (Gare Montparnasse) is a busy hub serving southwest France as well as Spain and Portugal. It is a real Parisian district with a vibrant and lively atmosphere.-->\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{Mapframe|48.841328|2.300292|zoom=13}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q50716}}\\n\\n[[Image:Bir Hakeim Bridge Soldier.jpg|thumb|250px|The Bir Hakeim Bridge Soldier, with the Eiffel Tower in the background]][[File:Paris-ile-des-cygnes-statue-de-la-liberte-tour-eiffel-seine.jpg|thumb|L'\\u00eele aux cygnes, ''statue de la Libert\\u00e9'', Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi]][[File:Cristaux.Jean Yves Lechevallier.jpg|thumb|Sculpture ''Cristaux'' in parc B\\u00e9la Bart\\u00f3k.

It was founded in 1905 and for many years was a fairly small settlement. However, several pivotal events in the early- to mid-20th century catapulted Las Vegas to prominence and set it on the path to grow into what it is today. First was the construction of nearby [[Hoover Dam]] from 1931 until 1936, which brought thousands of workers to the area. Second was the legalization of gambling by the state of Nevada in 1931, which led to the establishment of casinos and speakeasies that established Downtown Las Vegas as an entertainment center for the Hoover Dam workers.\\n\\nAmidst rapid growth in the local gambling industry, the luxurious El Rancho Vegas resort opened in 1941 on what would later become the Las Vegas Strip. This was followed up by Benjamin \\\"Bugsy\\\" Siegel's Flamingo Hotel in 1946, starting the building boom and one-upmanship that continues today. This would also create a precedent of organized crime involvement in Nevada's gambling industry. While federal regulations and enforcement as well as investments by established corporations have virtually wiped out any mob involvement today, the building bonanza continues with ever-more elaborate resorts and attractions being constructed.\\n\\nThe city is laid out as follows: Main Street as well as the numbered streets run north-south, starting with Main Street in the west. The bus station was on Main Street. Downtown has several hotel-casinos, as well as the \\\"Fremont Street Experience\\\", a pedestrian mall lined with casinos, shops, and restaurants near the western end of Fremont Street. A couple miles south of downtown starts the \\\"Strip\\\" (Las Vegas Boulevard South), a north-south street lined with large casino-hotels, shopping malls, and many other attractions. The northern end of the Strip is marked by the tall Stratosphere Tower. Frequent city buses run up and down the Strip and connect the Strip to downtown. The Las Vegas monorail and the convention center sit just east of the Strip, and the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV) is slightly further east on Maryland Parkway. The airport is at the southern end of the Strip.\\n\\nFor a variety of legal and historical reasons, most of the largest casinos are not actually situated in the City of Las Vegas. The Strip and most other Las Vegas attractions actually sit in Paradise \\u2014 an unincorporated town with just under 200,000 inhabitants.  The City of Las Vegas only controls Las Vegas Boulevard as far south as Sahara Avenue. In the United States, most unincorporated areas lack municipal self-governance, are rural, and have populations in the hundreds or thousands. The lobbying power of the casinos has ensured that Paradise remains unincorporated and that Las Vegas cannot annex it.  From a visitor's perspective, these legal distinctions are most important in terms of emergency services.  You will see different fire trucks and ambulances depending upon whether you are north or south of Sahara Avenue, but the same police cars, since the city and county merged their law enforcement into one agency in 1969.  \\n\\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Pacific, [[Macau]] has become an even bigger gambling center than Las Vegas by dollar volume. Many of Las Vegas' largest casinos have branches there. However, Macau is not (yet?) even close to Vegas as an entertainment venue, though it does have shows by major Chinese stars, and some Western entertainers.\\n\\nWithin the US, Las Vegas has no close competitors as a gambling destination; [[Atlantic City]] runs a rather distant second.\\n\\n===Visitor information===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Las Vegas Visitor Information Center | alt= | url=http://www.visitlasvegas.co | email=\\n| address=3150 Paradise Rd | lat= | long= | directions=inside Las Vegas Convention Center - Center Concourse\\n| phone=+1 702 892-0711 | tollfree=+1-877-847-4858 | fax=\\n| hours=M-F 8AM-5PM | price=\\n| lastedit=2019-01-05\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{climate\\n| units = imperial\\n| janhigh =   58.5    | febhigh =   62.9    | marhigh =   71.1    | aprhigh =   78.5\\n| mayhigh =   88.5    | junhigh =   99.4    | julhigh =   104.5   | aughigh =   102.8\\n| sephigh =   94.9    | octhigh =   81.2    | novhigh =   67.1    | dechigh =   56.9\\n| janlow =    40.5    | feblow =    44.1    | marlow =    50.5    | aprlow =    56.9\\n| maylow =    66.1    | junlow =    75.8    | jullow =    82.0    | auglow =    80.6\\n| seplow =    72.4    | octlow =    59.6    | novlow =    47.3    | declow =    39.6\\n| janprecip = 0.56   | febprecip = 0.80   | marprecip = 0.42   | aprprecip = 0.20\\n| mayprecip = 0.07   | junprecip = 0.04   | julprecip = 0.38   | augprecip = 0.32\\n| sepprecip = 0.32   | octprecip = 0.32   | novprecip = 0.30   | decprecip = 0.45\\n| description = {{ForecastNOAA|Las Vegas|36.0719|-115.1634}} &#160;&#160; Data from [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/normals NOAA (1991-2020)]\\n}}\\n\\nLas Vegas has a subtropical hot desert climate with short winters with mild days and cool nights; and long, extremely hot summers.

Expect this drive to be crowded and frustrating, unless you can come and go at off-peak hours; you may find air travel to be a better option with service to major California airports and many smaller ones as well. However, many find the 280-mile (450&nbsp;km) drive along I-15 restful and scenic.  Attractions along the I-15 include the [[California]] towns of [[Barstow]] and [[Baker (California)|Baker]]; the [[Mojave Desert]]; and small hotel-casinos in Nevada at [[Primm]] (at the California border) and Jean, respectively. If you are traveling the I-15, you are crossing a desert, and should carry (and drink) ample amounts of water, especially on hot summer days where temperatures can reach 110\\u00b0F (43\\u00b0C).\\n\\nFrom east of Las Vegas, travelers typically drive on I-40 through [[Arizona]], and then head north toward Vegas on US 93 in [[Kingman]], before US 93 becomes concurrent with Interstate 11 on the Colorado River bridge just downstream from Hoover Dam. I-11 is now complete from the river to State Route 157 in the far northwest of Las Vegas. In 2024, I-515 was decommissioned and became part of I-11, and I-11 signage was added to US 95 north of downtown Las Vegas. The completion of the I-11 bridge eliminated what was once the biggest traffic chokepoint of an otherwise sparsely populated desert area. The old road through this area still carries traffic to the [[Lake Mead National Recreation Area]] and directly through Boulder City. Even with long-haul through traffic now routed on the new bridge, the old road is still crowded with tourist traffic to Lake Mead and the dam.\\n\\nFrom the north, I-15 meets the Arizona border at the more relaxed town of [[Mesquite (Nevada)|Mesquite, Nevada]] and shortly goes into [[Utah]]. Most people driving from the east will exit onto I-15 at its junction with I-70, though those from further north may meet I-15 from I-80 in [[Salt Lake City]].\\n\\nThose traveling from the north drive on US-95 from [[Reno]] and [[Tonopah]]. This is a two-lane highway until it reaches the community of Mercury, where US-95 is a four-lane highway. The route is sparsely populated and travelers should ensure that their fuel tank is full.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nIntercity bus companies have their own separate stops or stations in different parts of town.

However, what may look to be a short walk of only a couple hotel-casinos away may be farther than you expected as the resorts often look closer than they are due to their large size.  In  most cases, hotels are connected to each other either by bridge or underground or in the case of Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay, by a complimentary rail shuttle. During the summer, the '''oppressive heat''' during the daylight hours may make walking a very uncomfortable activity. Take extra precautions when imbibing alcohol and walking outside as heat-stroke and severe dehydration are common health risks.\\n\\n===By monorail===\\n* {{listing | type=go\\n| name=Las Vegas Monorail | alt=RTC Transit | url=http://www.lvmonorail.com | email=customerservice@lvmonorail.com\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1 702 699-8200 | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=$5\\n| wikipedia=Las Vegas Monorail | wikidata=Q935072\\n| content=Runs along the east side of the Strip with stops behind several of the hotels and at the Las Vegas Convention Center. It costs $5 one-way and $12 for a one-day pass, with 2-7 day passes also available. Do the math before boarding; it could be cheaper for a small group to take a taxi. Because the monorail stops at the back entrance of the hotels, it takes a long time to wind through the maze of casinos, often taking 20 minutes to an hour to get from one point to another on the Strip - if you're in a hurry, take a taxi. The monorail's carrying capacity of 4,000 people per hour is woefully insufficient to handle the evening exodus from the larger conventions which have as many as 150,000 attendees. If you are visiting with a friend from Nevada and want to ride the monorail, consider asking them to buy your fare because by showing a Nevada State ID or Clark County Work Permit Card (issued to all hotel employees) they qualify for the locals' fare of $1. The discounted fare can be purchased from the customer service booths located at each station.\\n}}\\n\\nDue to high prices, inconvenient station locations, low passenger ridership, and the lack of any connection to downtown or the airport, the Monorail is widely regarded as a failure. It operated under the supervision of a federal bankruptcy court from January 2010 to May 2012 before being acquired by RTC Transit.\\n\\n===By resort trams===\\nThe resort trams serve the west side of the Strip (the monorail serves the east side) and are all people movers / automated guideway transit on elevated tracks with free fares.\\n* {{go\\n| name=Aria Express | alt=CityCenter Tram | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=Free\\n| wikidata=Q61757409\\n| lastedit=2021-12-14\\n| content=Connects the Bellagio to the Park MGM via the Aria and the Waldorf Astoria.\\n}}\\n* {{go\\n| name=Mandalay Bay Tram | alt=Mandalay Bay Excalibur Tram| url=https://mandalaybay.mgmresorts.com/en/amenities/transportation.html | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=M-Th closed, F-Su 2-10PM | price=Free\\n| wikidata=Q2302214\\n| lastedit=2021-12-14\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{go\\n| name=Mirage-Treasure Island Hotel and Casino Tram | alt= | url=https://treasureisland.com/amenities/guest-services | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=M-W closed, Su Th noon-9PM, F Sa noon-midnight | price=Free\\n| wikidata=Q110269741\\n| lastedit=2021-12-14\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===By public transit===\\n[[File:CAT Enviro500 103.jpg|thumb|300px|The Deuce runs along the Strip]]\\nBuses can be an inexpensive and convenient option, especially if just traveling up-and-down the Strip, or to-and-from downtown. A bus ride is a good way to recuperate during those hot summer months after a long and tiring walk on the Strip since the buses are air-conditioned.\\n* {{listing\\n| name=RTC Transit | alt= | url=https://www.rtcsnv.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1 702 228-7433 | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=The city bus system operates routes throughout the valley. Most routes operate 5:30AM-1:30AM daily, but some routes operate 24 hours per day. In addition to regular service, there is also the '''[https://rtcws.rtcsnv.com/routepdf/deuce.pdf Deuce]''', a double-decker bus. The Deuce runs 24 hours a day. On the Strip, Deuce buses often stop at short intervals and may be there for a couple of minutes as passengers board and disembark. There is also a Free '''[https://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/Residents/Parking-Transportation/Downtown-Loop Downtown Loop]''' shuttle bus (by city of Las Vegas) between the Strat, Bonneville Transit Center, the Fremont East Entertainment District, and points in between the Downtown area and the Arts District. The Downtown Loops is a FREE ride while RTC buses cost money.\\n}}\\n\\nThe fare is $2 for all RTC residential routes (transfers an extra $1), and $6 for Deuce service (includes transfer). The fare for residential routes and the Deuce may be paid in cash directly to the driver (no change given). It's also possible to buy tickets for RTC routes with credit/debit cards using the Ride RTC mobile app (iOS and Android). Ticket vending machines give change and accept credit/debit cards. A day pass which includes fare for Deuce service costs $8, while a 3-day pass costs $20. Passes are issued from vending machines on \\\"Transit Pass\\\" tickets printed on shiny card stock with magnetic stripes, which you slide through a reader in front of the bus driver.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\nOne of the easiest ways to get around is by taxi.  Every hotel and most attractions have a taxi stand.  It is relatively cheap to go from hotel to hotel, but since traffic is often so congested on the strip, taking a taxi often isn't much faster than walking. Many taxis will cut off the strip to use a parallel road\\u2014this is often faster but can double your taxi fare. The taxi driver is required to use the meter and to take the shortest route to your destination. There is a surcharge for rides originating at the airport, but not for extra passengers.\\n\\nAll taxis require an address for pickup and drop off. '''It is illegal in Las Vegas for taxis to pick up or drop off passengers on the street''', especially on the Strip. It is customary to tip the hotel taxi dispatcher $1 and tip the taxi driver 15% of the meter, and about $1 per piece of luggage.\\n\\nIf you are traveling with a large group, consider hiring a limousine, as you will often forgo a wait and the price per person may even be lower than that using a taxicab.  Limousines usually queue in front of the taxicab line and can be approached directly.\\n\\n=== By ride hailing ===\\nRide hailing companies have established legal operating status in Las Vegas, and operate throughout the Las Vegas Valley. The two most common rideshare services are operated by [https://lyft.com/ Lyft] and [https://www.uber.com/ Uber]. These cars are typically Las Vegas locals who drive their personal vehicles full or part-time via the corresponding app. In order to utilize rideshare, you must have the Lyft or Uber app (or both) installed on your smartphone, a registered account, and a valid credit card.\\n\\nUber and Lyft drivers will take you anywhere in the valley for a fee calculated by a base-fare, duration, and distance traveled. This price is often much cheaper than a traditional taxi cab. Drivers can pick up or drop off at the airport, and even take you to Hoover Dam.\\n\\nAs with taxis, all rides must have an address for pickup and drop off. Again, '''it is illegal in Las Vegas to pick up or drop off passengers on the street.''' For every major hotel on The Strip, there is a designated pickup/drop off area for rideshare services. Drop off is usually done at the main valet or front entrance; however, pickup can be in the parking garage (e.g. MGM Grand), a tour bus lobby (Bellagio) or at a side entrance to the casino (Linq). Asking guest services at the hotel where the designated pickup area is will help a lot. It could take several minutes to walk to, or locate this pickup area. Ordering your ride before arriving at the pickup area is not recommended as many drivers stage at, or nearby the pickup area. You can be charged a \\\"No-Show\\\" fee if you do not arrive to the pickup area in as little as 2 minutes.\\n\\n===By car===\\n[[File:Brake lights on the Las Vegas Strip.jpg|thumb|350px|Brake lights on a Saturday night in front of the Bellagio, as seen from the upper level of the Deuce bus]]\\n'''Driving Las Vegas Boulevard (the \\\"Strip\\\"), especially on weekends, is an exercise in frustration.''' Due to extremely severe gridlock, you could easily spend an hour (or more) sitting in traffic on the Strip just to travel a couple of miles\\u2014good for viewing the spectacle, but bad if you're actually trying to get somewhere. The Strip's most critically congested section is the 1.7-mile-long portion between Spring Mountain Road/Sands Avenue to the north and Tropicana Avenue to the south, which happens to be where almost all of the major hotel-casinos are located (the intersection of Tropicana Ave. and the Strip is one of the busiest in the world).\\n\\nDo what the locals do and avoid driving long distances on the Strip altogether. Instead take I-15, which parallels the Strip, and get off at the exit nearest your hotel and park there. Frank Sinatra Drive (which connects to Sammy Davis Jr. Drive) lies just west of the Strip, runs behind the casinos, and provides another option. Koval Lane and Paradise Road provide similar access on the eastern side of the Strip.  If you need to do an east or west traverse of the northern half of the Strip and I-15, consider using the Desert Inn Road superarterial, which was built specifically to provide a fast grade-separated route for east-west traffic.\\n\\nVirtually no major casinos on the Strip or downtown offer free parking anymore, but many offer valet parking for a charge. On Friday and Saturday nights, the self-parking lots fill up fast; consider splurging on the valet to avoid cumbersome delays and endless circling around.\\n\\nSome intersections in Nevada have an atypical traffic light signal: a flashing-yellow left arrow.  This indicates that you may turn left after yielding the right-of-way to oncoming traffic and pedestrians.  From flashing yellow, the arrow can either go to green for a traditional protected left turn or to solid yellow which indicates it is going to turn red.\\n\\n====Rental cars====\\nIf you mostly plan to hang around one casino and your time in Vegas is short, you might want to forego a rental car altogether and just take taxis. On the other hand, taxi/rideshare fares add up quickly, and with car rental so cheap, anyone staying a few days or longer would be better suited with the flexibility of a car. Some of the best sights are located just ''outside'' of Las Vegas and require that you drive to those destinations.  If you need to or might go farther (e.g., out of state), ensure your rental agreement allows it and sharing of driving duties.\\n\\nThe base rental price for a car ''at'' Harry Reid International Airport is quite competitive with other major cities.  Unfortunately, agencies at the airport must levy very large fees (e.g., for airport improvements) and taxes on those base prices. These can increase the modest weekly cost of a compact or intermediate size car by nearly 60 percent.\\n\\n*  All airport rental car agencies share a single off-airport facility, the {{marker|type=around|name=McCarran Rent-A-Car Center|url=https://www.mccarran.com/Transportation/RentalCars|lat=36.06005|long=-115.16444}}, served by frequent free shuttle buses.  However, the Rent-A-Car Center is located 2.8 mi (4.5 mi) south of the airport (meaning shuttle buses must pass through the congested Paradise Road tunnel).  Add at least 30 minutes to your schedule to pick up and/or drop off your vehicle to ensure you won't be late for meetings or departure flights.\\n*  There are numerous car rental offices on the Strip making it very easy to rent a car from your hotel for a day trip.  Rent ahead of time as it can be busy during weekends and during major conventions.  Check to see if those off-airport sites must also charge the above fees and taxes. From the McCarran Rent-a-Car Center there are additional shuttles to additional car rental offices not in the Rent-a-Car Center. They are at the outer curb/island in front of the rent-a-car center.\\n\\n==See==\\n[[File:Sphinx at the Luxor 2.jpg|300px|thumb|The Sphinx and pyramid at Luxor hotel]]\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\nSet in the middle of the desert of Nevada, Las Vegas can seem unreal at first sight. The skyline of the Strip features many unusual buildings side by side, and once you've come closer and get to travel along the Strip you'll to see replicas of buildings from around the world like the Eiffel Tower, the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Statue of Liberty or St Mark's Campanile. The buildings that aren't copies also look striking, and there are things happening along the street like the dancing fountains of Bellagio, not to mention the colorful signs, of which there however are even more in the old town of Las Vegas; Downtown.\\n\\nInside hotels and casinos (the terms are interchangeable), expect to see myriads of slot machines, and gambling from card games to craps and roulette to sports betting. Hotel casinos often have a certain theme, and is decorated and sometimes features attractions to that theme, like the flamingo garden in Flamingo.\\n\\nA combination pass, the '''[http://www.lasvegaspass.com/ Las Vegas Power Pass]''', gives holders free admission to many of the attractions listed in the districts, including the Stratosphere Tower Observation Deck, Madame Tussauds, Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat, Springs Preserve, the National Atomic Testing Museum, and plenty of others, as well as numerous activities and tours.\\n\\n==Do==\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\nThere's a great deal to do in Las Vegas; in addition to the gambling, the city is most famous for, you can for instance see a show, ride amusement park rides, watch and do sports or try to escape from an escape room. For mountain activities such as hiking, climbing, and skiing close to Las Vegas, see [[Las Vegas#Go next|Go next]].\\n\\n===Shows===\\nThere are places on the Strip where you can buy half-price show tickets, but generally not for the really popular shows on the same day of the performance. Cash or credit card accepted. Shows include circus shows, musicals, production shows, comedy, magic, tribute shows, adult shows,\\n\\nLas Vegas hosts 8 popular [http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/ '''Cirque du Soleil'''] shows. To secure the best seats, reservations well in advance are recommended.\\n\\n====Production shows====\\n\\nReserve your tickets well in advance for the best available seating. The most popular shows are sold out on the weekends. Make sure to always book your seats directly from the official hotel website.\\n\\n====Comedy shows====\\nThere are always different comedians coming to Las Vegas. Always a great way to get a laugh and end the night.\\n\\n===Gamble===\\n\\n{{infobox|If you win...|Chances are, if you win it big in Las Vegas and you are not a U.S. citizen, your winnings will be subject to a '''30% withholding tax''' from the '''IRS'''.

You should get this from the casino, so don't lose it...it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.}}\\n\\nOpportunities to [[gambling|gamble]] are found in most places in the Las Vegas metro area, even at Harry Reid Airport and small supermarkets.\\n\\n====Age restrictions====\\n\\nIt is state law that '''all gamblers must be at least 21 years of age''' and state law also prohibits anybody under the age of 21 from loitering in any area where gaming is present. Even if you are at least 21 years old, you are required to bring to the casino a valid, government-issued ID that shows your current age or complete date of birth (e.g. driver's license, passport) as proof of your age. Photocopies of valid IDs are usually not considered valid and temporary paper documents (i.e. the documents issued while the actual ID is being mailed to you) are not generally accepted unless accompanied by the corresponding ID. Non-US drivers licenses and identification cards (aside from passports) can be accepted at the casino's discretion but do not count on it.\\n\\nIn-house security makes rounds of inspections to check compliance. If you are under-age or without a valid ID to prove your age and found in the gambling premises, hotel staff will ask you to leave, and could ask the metro police to issue you a citation. Moreover, under-age gamblers cannot collect any jackpot; such bets are void and the casino will at best return your wager before asking you to leave the premises.\\n\\nThere is a curfew for those under the age of 18 (unless accompanied by an adult) for Strip and Downtown areas of 9PM; for other areas in Las Vegas, the curfew is 10:00pm. During certain events (e.g. New Year's Eve) there are extended hours on the curfew.\\n\\n====The odds====\\n[[File:NewYork hotel Vegas2.jpg|thumb|Expect to see hundreds and hundreds of slot machines inside any casino...]]\\n[[File:Gambling games.jpg|thumb|...in addition to pretty much any other kind of gambling]]\\nIt is beneficial to understand the rules, strategies, and odds of each game before you arrive. The games with the lowest house advantage if you know how to play are '''craps''' (dice) with full odds and '''blackjack'''; however, tables where a 21-blackjack pays only 6:5 or even-money instead of the traditional 3:2 give the house a big advantage, and should be avoided. Games in which the casino has the best house advantage include slot machines, roulette, and some craps bets (hardways and propositions). If a game is unfamiliar to you, just ask the dealer for advice on how to play. If you are playing during the daytime at a table that is not crowded, most dealers will be happy to explain the game to you, and even slow down the dealing.\\n\\nWhile '''card counting''' (the act of keeping track of played cards in an effort to boost your odds) is not illegal under federal law, some casinos' policies bar/ban people who count cards or may refuse winnings.\\n\\n====ATMs====\\n\\nMost casinos offer ATMs and over-the-counter cash facilities, but beware about the charges set by your bank and the machine operator or establishment. ATMs in casinos may charge exorbitant fees for withdrawals.\\n\\n====Comps====\\n\\nOne reason to gamble, aside from the hope of winning money, is that by doing so, you could receive complimentary (\\\"comp\\\") rooms, meals, and even airfare depending on your play (this is because the casinos want to \\\"win some of their money back\\\" from the high rollers). Most casinos issue free \\\"player cards.\\\" It is generally to your advantage to show or insert your player card every time you play a table game or slot machine. At the end of your trip, you can ask the hotel if you are eligible for any comps, you might be pleasantly surprised. And if you arrive at the casino prepared to lay out $1,000 or more, don't be bashful; ask the pit boss to be \\\"rated\\\" for comps before or while you begin playing. Separate from comps, many hotels offer discount packages for travelers who book a Sunday-Thursday night arrival. Most of these packages offer gambling coupons or a matching play\\u2014see the Sleep section for details.\\n\\n====Poker====\\n\\nTexas Hold'em, 7-card stud, and Omaha can be found at almost all Las Vegas poker rooms. However, not all casinos have a poker room, so call the casino or ask a gaming floor attendant. Smoke sensitive players should note that while all poker rooms on the Strip are non-smoking, smoke may drift in from the casino if the room is not fully enclosed.\\n\\nDuring June and July, the [http://www.wsop.com/ World Series of Poker] (WSOP) is held in Las Vegas.

You can choose an elaborate theme wedding, such as an Elvis impersonator as officiant, or a simple ceremony and reception celebration.\\n\\nMost major hotels and Vegas wedding chapels offer wedding packages for those who wish to plan a larger wedding ceremony. But don't let a lack of planning stop your nuptials; all Vegas wedding chapels can perform immediate weddings with no prior appointment, although it is recommended to make a reservation for your wedding. If you make a reservation most chapels will provide courtesy limousine transportation from your hotel to the chapel and back. Making a reservation also decreases the likelihood of having to wait.\\n\\n===Events===\\n\\nLas Vegas continues to grow with annual events and festivals held throughout the city.\\n\\n* {{event\\n| name=Electric Daisy Carnival | alt=EDC Las Vegas | url=http://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/| email=\\n| year= | month=May | date=\\n| endmonth= | enddate=\\n| location=Las Vegas Motor Speedway | country=\\n| address=435 S Grand Central Pkwy | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=$420 and up\\n| content=A massive 3-night multi-stage music carnival in mid-May that includes venues from the world's top artists along with rides, fireworks, and mesmerizing rave-infused light shows.}}\\n* {{event\\n| name=Helldorado Days | alt= | url=http://www.elkshelldorado.com/| email=\\n| year= | month=May| date=\\n| endmonth= | enddate=\\n| location=symphony Park | country=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=With origins dating back to 1934, Helldorado Days is host to Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) rodeos, a locals rodeo, a parade, carnival, Whiskerino (facial hair) contest, golf tournament, poker tournament, art show, art auction, exhibits, and food and beverages.}}\\n* {{event\\n| name=iHeartRadio Music Festival | alt= | url=http://festival.iheart.com/| email=\\n| year= | month=September| date=\\n| endmonth= | enddate=\\n| location=MGM Grand Garden Arena | country=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=A 2-day music festival that features 20 to 30 chart-topping musical artists.}}\\n* {{event\\n| name=Las Vegas Greek Food Festival | alt= | url=http://lvgff.com/ | email=\\n| year= | month=September | date=\\n| endmonth= | enddate=\\n| location=5300 El Camino Road | country=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=$8-15\\n| content=A weekend festival in mid-September that celebrates the traditions and cuisine of Greek culture.

Not only do many of the hotels offer excellent courts but public courts abound as well.

Downtown Summerlin Mall also has one during winter.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n\\n===Sales tax===\\n[[File:MiracleMileShops.jpg|thumb|350px|Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood]]\\n\\nThe combined state and local sales tax in all of Clark County (meaning the entire Las Vegas metro area) is 8.375%.  Only groceries and prescription drugs are exempt.\\n\\nLike most U.S. states, Nevada has not implemented a tax refund mechanism for international travelers. The only retailers that can sell tax-free items to international travelers are the duty-free shops at Harry Reid International Airport.\\n\\n===Basics===\\n\\nMost hotel/casino resort complexes in Las Vegas have a gift shop open 24/7 that offers basic traveler supplies and sundries.  Hotel gift shops are outrageously expensive and should be avoided except for emergencies.\\n\\nIf you are planning to not rent a car and to simply go up and down the Strip on foot or bus, the pharmacies are your best bet for basic supplies.  They are all open 24/7 and accustomed to dealing with tourists from all over the world.\\n\\nLike most U.S. pharmacies, they carry a very large variety of products besides pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements, including snacks, soft drinks, bottled water, cosmetics, toiletries, hats, sunscreen, maps, postcards, and so on.  '''CVS Pharmacy''' has three branches on the Strip, one located on South Strip between CityCenter and Park MGM, one between Paris and Horseshoe, and one located on North Strip between Circus Circus and Sahara Avenue.  '''Walgreens''' has one branch on Central Strip at Palazzo, another on South Strip in front of Planet Hollywood, and a third in the Showcase Mall in front of MGM Grand.\\n\\nThe Hawaiian convenience store chain '''ABC Stores''' has four stores serving the Las Vegas Strip. \\n\\nThere are also '''7-Eleven''' convenience stores open 24/7 throughout the Strip, but their prices tend to be higher than the pharmacies and their product selection is not as broad. Souvenirs, drinks and snacks are also available at small stores along the strip; there is a cluster of them between MGM and Planet Hollywood as well as north of the Wynn. These are usually the cheapest places to shop, even if the selection is quite limited.\\n\\n'''Target''' has opened a store in Showcase Mall to the south of the Walgreens, and while it is smaller than typical Targets (which can be found in other parts of Las Vegas), the store is still very comprehensive and provides a selection of the most important supermarket essentials. Importantly, there are '''no major supermarkets''' on the Las Vegas Strip near the resorts. The closest one that sits on Las Vegas Boulevard is the Whole Foods Market at Town Square (see below).  Other than that, one has to travel as far west as Valley View Boulevard or as far east as Maryland Parkway to find supermarkets such as Vons, Albertsons, Food4Less, and Smith's. There is even a Walmart at Tropicana Avenue, about 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) east of the Strip. These places are however accessible by car or bus, prices are lower than on the Strip, and if you're, say a European looking for some authentic American specialties to bring home these are certainly better places to find them than 7-Eleven.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n\\nLarge casinos will invariably offer a variety of dining options, ranging from the omnipresent buffet to simple cafes to gourmet restaurants to Michelin-star winning restaurants. While there are a few spots along The Strip where you can find a deal, expect to pay a premium even for a simple meal unless you venture to another part of town.\\n\\n===Buffets===\\n\\nThe most famous buffets in Las Vegas are at the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Cosmopolitan, and Wynn. The best buffets typically cost about $50 a person for a weekend dinner. Lunch is your best value at most buffets when they are around half price, breakfasts are cheapest and often have a great spread too. Do not forget that tipping your buffet waiter at least $1 per person/drink is customary. You can leave cash on the table at the end of your meal or tip the cashier at the counter on a credit card. Some buffets give \\\"early bird\\\" discounts, which means that if you arrive early the price is a few dollars lower.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n\\nIn Las Vegas, free drinks are often offered to gamblers, even those playing 5-cent slot machines. You should tip the waitress at least $1 per drink; failure to do so will likely cost you free drink privileges.\\n\\nAlthough it is officially NOT allowed per the lawbooks, drinking on public sidewalks and other areas on the Strip and Downtown is rarely if ever enforced. Thus it is entirely common to consume alcohol in public areas, including the public sidewalks within the Las Vegas city limits which includes all of Downtown, The Strip and close-by areas. Again, as previously mentioned, over-intoxication and disorderly conduct is frowned upon, so stay within your own limits. On special occasions (New Year's Eve and Independence Day for example) there may be bans on glass bottles and/or aluminum cans for the Strip and the Downtown area. Plastic cups and sports bottles are allowed at these times and either provided at purchase or often available at hotel/casino exit doors. When inside a casino or hotel there is seldom any restrictions on carrying drinks from one bar, restaurant or playing location to another with the exception of some showrooms and theaters where it will be clearly posted. Individual shops may also have rules about carrying in food and drink of any kind. \\n\\nThe towns of North Las Vegas, Henderson and other outlying areas have ''very different'' regulations forbidding removal of alcohol from bars, etc. so check with your host or doorman if in doubt. Many bars and liquor stores are open 24 hours a day. There are also posted laws for convenience stores, grocery stores and other retail liquor outlets restricting consumption in the immediate vicinity. Most of all, always drink responsibly and realize that the hot, dry desert air in the summer months can have very adverse health affects on people consuming alcohol such as rapid dehydration and deadly heat stroke, even after dark. Drink plenty of water as well!\\n\\n===Nightclubs/dancing===\\nThere is a club or lounge in nearly every hotel and casino. Most clubs remain open until 4AM, with various after-hour clubs available for the truly hard-core partiers. Drink prices can range anywhere from $4\\u20138 for a domestic bottle of beer, $8\\u201310 for well drinks made with cheap generic liquor, and $200 or more for a bottle of spirits. Clubs are always busy on weekends, and may also be packed during weekdays at places that have Service Industry Night (SIN), usually Tuesday to Thursday, when locals working in the service industry have their night off.\\n\\nA good way to find out what places are hot in Vegas is to look up the \\\"Vegas\\\" or \\\"LV\\\" hashtag on social media services like Instagram or Twitter. The reason is that club and event promoters alike cleverly utilize the services as a way of reaching their audiences to announce specials, celebrity appearances, and guest list availability. They usually post a flyer of the event and include their cell number, so that you can text them and let them know the male-to-female ratio in your party. Groups with higher women-to-men ratios tend to have better offers for guest list entry, drinks, etc. Most promoters usually work for specific establishments, but generally connect you to other promoters in their networks who work for the establishment you ask for.\\n\\nThe top clubs will charge entry of $15 or more. Exceptions may include those who have reserved a table, those who get there early, ladies, and locals. Expect to wait in a line for 10 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the night. It is usually best to arrive before 10PM; while the club may be emptier, the line will be shorter and you may avoid paying a cover charge. Sitting at a table often requires a bottle purchase and if you stop making purchases, they will ask you to vacate the table so that someone else can occupy the table. Some nightclubs have official dress codes that, for example, advise against wearing hats, shorts, flip flops, sandals, sneakers, athletic wear, ripped or oversized clothing, or steel toe shoes.\\n\\nDay clubs are usually open in the months between April and September.\\n\\n===Ultra lounge===\\nAn ultra lounge is a mix between a lounge and a night club, but the difference to \\\"real\\\" night clubs is tiny and vanishes completely when the DJ pulls out hard-core dance hits.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n{{sleeppricerange|under $100|$100-199|$200 and over}}\\n\\n{{cautionbox|With some exceptions, hotels and other sleeping establishments '''will not allow anyone under age 21 to reserve a room due to on-site gambling'''. For those of age 18-20, it is '''highly recommended''' to research and reserve in advance of arrival.|lastedit=permanent}}\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n\\nLas Vegas is a very peculiar destination - and hotels in Las Vegas have a lot of peculiarities that you won't find in other cities.\\n[[File:Flamingo Hotel LV.JPG|thumb|300px|Flamingo]]\\n\\nThe vast majority of visitors to Las Vegas arrive on Friday or Saturday nights and stay for the weekend. As such, room rates can seem ridiculously cheap from Sunday-Thursday night but zoom upwards on weekends. Travelers can plan a trip to their advantage: by staying, say, Sunday through to Thursday, one can not only save a bundle on hotel rates, but also take advantage of package deals that may include a show, meals, and gambling coupons\\u2014occasionally worth more than the cost of the hotel room itself.\\n\\nA bad surprise at check-in are so-called '''\\\"resort fees\\\"'''. Many hotels in Las Vegas collect this fee on top of the room charge (typically between $10 and $20 per night, but can sometimes be more like $50) when you check in. You won't get around paying it, even if you claim that your hotel booking website had indicated the total pricing as final. The resort fee is apparently an attempt at introducing low-cost airline-style pricing to hotels: splitting up the price into an attractively cheap basic fee, and charging the customer for almost everything separately. Thusly, in Las Vegas, the resort fee typically \\\"covers\\\" the usage of the swimming pool and of the fitness center. Some hotels do not collect resort fees. It may be worth it to ask the front desk to remove this fee, especially if you had a bad experience with your stay. However, keep your expectations low but be polite and reasonable.\\n\\nIn Las Vegas hotels, even the resort fee does not always cover hotel amenities that are included for free in hotels in the rest of the world.  These charges may be eye-poppingly expensive.  Most Las Vegas hotels charge separately for use of the fitness center with rates, around $20 to $40 per visit.  Local calls are usually billed, and wireless internet is generally at least $12 per day. Unless the service is clearly marked as free, it is better to use your own cell phone or mobile router.  In-room coffee may cost more than twice as much as the coffee shop down the street.  The mini-bar, which you might think is a convenient in-room refrigerator, but which they think of as an electronically monitored, vibration-sensitive, highly profitable vending machine that will charge you the moment you move or lift any item off its sensor pad, is another poorly marked trap for travelers.  Not only are the items overpriced \\u2013 especially for bottled water, whose price generally is around $8\\u201310 per small bottle, but which can be as high as $25 \\u2013 but putting your own items in the in-room refrigerator may cost you $25 or $50.  If you need to use a refrigerator (e.g., to store medications or breast milk), talk to the front desk about your options.  A few hotels ban all outside food and beverages.  Most don't object to carry-out food, but few permit guests to tote large amounts of outside booze up to a room, as that often ends with noise complaints and safety concerns.\\n\\nDue to the flamboyant and lively atmosphere of most casino hotels, you may not get a good night's sleep, especially on weekends or during busy tourist seasons. Drunken parties and associated recklessness are frequent occurrences in most of the motels and hotels on the Strip. Most hotels will send security personnel up to disperse loud parties or to warn drunk patrons to keep the noise down if you call the front desk, but their effectiveness may vary. Quiet alternatives include the Four Seasons Hotel, Vdara, Waldorf Astoria, and Skylofts at MGM Grand.\\n\\nIn Las Vegas parlance, the words \\\"hotel\\\" and \\\"casino\\\" are interchangeable. There is a big difference between casino hotels and mainstream hotels without gambling. Casino hotels tend to be large (often with a long walk from the parking to your room and often via the gambling floor). The size of casino hotels means that they often have a wider range of services (restaurants, bars, shops, coffee shops, etc.) and many facilities have long opening hours or are open 24 hours.\\n\\n===Off the Strip===\\nAlong the main roads leading off the Strip are a wide variety of accommodations, ranging from basic budget motels to splashy, full-size resorts every bit as expensive as those on the Strip.\\n\\n===Downtown/Fremont Street===\\nMost accommodations in Downtown tend to be of the budget variety, owing to the distance to the Strip. However, hotels in Downtown still put you within very close distance to the casinos of Fremont Street. The Downtown area is also where you'll find the few hostels Las Vegas has.\\n\\n===Further out===\\nMany modest hotels, well-away from the Strip and downtown, cater to \\\"locals\\\"; many offer lower rates and (often) better games. These are complemented by plush, full-resort hotels/casinos in some locations. There are also a number of RV parks further out. Additionally, the suburbs of [[Henderson]] and [[North Las Vegas]] have plenty of cheap accommodations.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\nBe vigilant and do not leave any valuables visible in your car. If you are lucky enough to win a large jackpot, you can ask the casino to hold your winnings in its safe or to pay you with a check so that you are not walking out the door with a large amount of cash. If you insist on receiving all your winnings in cash, all casinos have security personnel available to escort you to your car or room upon request.  Like most large tourism destinations, the Strip has its share of pickpockets, so keep your wallet in a front pocket or hold onto your purse.\\n\\nMajor casinos are generally very safe.  Casinos take security very seriously and have cameras recording almost every square inch of their property, as well as uniformed and plainclothes security personnel patrolling at all times.\\n\\nMake sure your hotel door is closed safely at night and use the deadbolt if one is provided. If there is knocking on the door at night, don't open it unless you are sure of the good intentions of the persons that knocked. If you are not expecting someone, do not open the door.\\n\\nStreet vendors selling water and other beverages do not have a permit to sell them and are frequently stopped by hotel/casino staff. Try to make sure whatever you're buying is sealed.\\n\\n===Additional information===\\n\\nDespite the advertising slogan '''What happens here, stays here''', Las Vegas has laws that are vigorously enforced. Contrary to popular belief, prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas and all of Clark County, although it is legal at licensed brothels in a few rural counties of Nevada outside of the Las Vegas area.  Pedestrians may drink alcohol from an open container on the Strip, but not in automobiles (not even for passengers) and the alcohol must be in a plastic container.\\n\\n===Driving dangers===\\n\\nRemain vigilant while driving. Las Vegas Boulevard (\\\"the Strip\\\") is notorious for fender benders and other traffic collisions as a result of the heavy stop-and-go traffic and the numerous distractions (electronic signage and water fountains) visible to drivers.  \\n\\nInterstate 15 is routinely under construction to relieve its perennial traffic jams. The construction zones tend to have inadequate signage and poor lane markings, which combined with the large number of tourists results in frequent last-minute lane changes and in turn, many multi-vehicle car accidents.  Many people are also driving intoxicated as well; Nevada has an unusually high frequency of traffic deaths with alcohol involved, and most of them happen near the Strip.\\n\\n== Stay healthy ==\\nFor non-emergency healthcare, there are several businesses offering same-day, walk-in care, such as [https://www.umcsn.com/medical-services/quick-care UMC Quick Care].  If you're staying in a hotel, the front desk will be able to recommend one to you.  As with all of the US, the emergency phone number is 911 and, {{show by date|2022|08|01|from|since}} mid-July 2022, the crisis number is 988.\\n\\n===Heat exhaustion and dehydration===\\n\\nExpect extremely low humidity and temperatures above 105\\u00b0F (40\\u00b0C) June to September. Bring sunscreen and wear loose, light-colored clothing that substantially reflects sunlight. Avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of water.\\n\\n=== Mental health, suicidal thoughts, substances, and other problems ===\\nAlthough the story about gambling away all your money and then dying by suicide is much more likely to happen in the movies than in real life, Las Vegas is no stranger to the person experiencing a crisis, and it offers substantial support when you need it.  If you are in crisis, whether due to something you think is going to ruin your life, a crisis in a relationship, a bad trip (the drug kind or the travel kind), or a flare-up of a previous problem, contact emergency services or the crisis support line.  You can also walk in to any hospital's emergency room or any urgent care clinic and ask for help.\\n\\nFor ongoing support, there are hundreds of [https://gamblersanonymous.org/ga/locations/state/table/NV/na/na/na/na/ Gamblers Anonymous]{{Dead link|date=March 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}, [https://region51na.org/ Narcotics Anonymous], and [https://lvcentraloffice.org/meetings/ AA meetings] in the Las Vegas area, and most meetings are open to travelers.\\n\\n==Connect==\\n\\n===Internet===\\n\\nEssentially all hotels offer in-room Wi-Fi. However, unlike virtually everywhere else in the U.S., many hotels, especially those on the Strip, charge for Wi-Fi access, either separately or bundled into the so-called \\\"resort fee\\\". On the other hand, free Wi-Fi is readily available at most businesses.  Temporary SIM cards for international visitors can be purchased at most convenience stores, drug stores, and at Harry Reid Airport.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\n===Smoking===\\n\\nInside all large casinos (generally those casinos exceeding 15 slot machines), strip clubs and standalone bars not serving food, smoking is permitted. In large casinos, there are areas which are smoke-free, but they may be very close to smoking areas. Poker rooms are typically smoke-free. Smoke-free table games and slot areas are also available.  Restaurants inside casinos are non-smoking. Nightclubs and lounges may allow smoking if they do not serve food.\\n\\nFor all other standalone restaurants, bars, convenience stores, grocery stores and airport facilities smoking is banned in all establishments which sell food other than prepackaged snacks. This ban will be obvious in most places by the absence of ashtrays and the required clearly posted signs. In most cases, smoking areas may be provided outdoors, so always ask your server since various options are almost always available. The penalty can be a $100\\u2013$600 ticket if you are caught by authorities.\\n\\nIn practice, there is extremely lax official enforcement in most informal off-strip locations due to a lack of enforcement personnel, and some will even offer ashtrays \\\"at your own risk\\\" if you ask for one. Smoking is still permitted in any stand alone bar or club (with or without gambling machines) that do not serve food other than prepackaged snacks (such as  chips, pretzels, candy bars). Although a gray area, some smoking-permitted bars which do not serve food will let you carry food in from adjacent/attached non-smoking restaurants so ask. Many stand alone restaurants now also provide a physically separated (separate entry doors and separate ventilatation) non-smoking dining area and a smoking bar or gaming area to accommodate both smokers and non-smokers.\\n\\n===ATM===\\nTry to avoid ATMs inside casinos and nightclubs, as they will often charge high transaction fees. If you need cash, it's a good idea to get it before going inside a casino or club. Check ahead to see if your bank has locations in Las Vegas. If you bank at a credit union, check ahead to see if your institution has any ATM alliance partners in Las Vegas; most US credit unions are part of one or more alliances that allow members of all alliance institutions to use one another's ATMs without a fee. On the Strip, the following ATMs are safer bets:\\n*For Bank of America customers, there's an ATM inside the M&M's Store on the 4th floor, and a pair in the Caesars Palace Forum Shops in the long hallway between the atrium closer to the Mirage and the fork in the Forum Shops where Trevi is.\\n*For Chase customers, there are ATMs in both of the CVS Pharmacies on the Strip (one near the Monte Carlo, and one by the Hilton Grand just north of Circus Circus).\\n*Wells Fargo has plenty of ATMs at the airport.\\n*For Citibank customers, there are ATMs inside the local 7-Eleven convenience stores.\\n*If you're not a member of any of these banks, there is also a cheap ATM that charges a $1 fee located inside Casino Royale, next to the cage to the left of the bar.\\n\\n===Consulates===\\nMost consulates are honorary which means they offer limited services to travelers and their nationals living in the area and usually available by appointment only. They are located in different parts of town. The nearest cities for additional foreign consulates for the west coast are in [[Los Angeles#Consulates|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco#Consulates|San Francisco]]:\\n\\n* {{flag|El Salvador}} {{listing\\n| name=El Salvador | alt= | url=https://rree.gob.sv/ | email=ConsuladoLasVegas@rree.gob.sv\\n| address=765 N.

The bustling, cosmopolitan heart of the 4th largest metropolis in the world and by far the most populous city in the United States, New York has long been a key entry point and a defining city for the nation.\\n\\nFrom the [[Statue of Liberty]] in the harbor to the Empire State Building towering over the Manhattan skyline, from the tunnels of the subway to the riches of Wall Street, from the bright signs of Times Square to the naturalistic beauty of [[Central Park]], and from Yankee Stadium in the Bronx to Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York's landmarks are quintessential American landmarks. The city's neighborhoods and streets are so iconic they have become ingrained into the American consciousness. Here the power, wealth and culture of the United States is on full display in one of the largest and most iconic skylines in the world, in the food and music to be found around every corner, and in the diverse population of immigrants who come from every corner of the globe to take part in what this city has to offer.\\n\\nLying at the mouth of the Hudson River in the southernmost part of the [[New York (state)|state of the same name]] and at the center of the [[Mid-Atlantic]] region, New York City is home to approximately 8.3&nbsp;million people.

It is home to many world-class museums, art galleries, and theaters. Many of the world's largest corporations have their headquarters here. The headquarters of the United Nations is in New York and most countries have a consulate here. This city's influence on the world and all its inhabitants is hard to overstate, as decisions made within its boundaries often have impacts and ramifications around the globe.\\n\\nImmigrants (and their descendants) from over 180 countries live here, making it one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Travelers are attracted to New York City for its culture, energy and cosmopolitanism.\\n\\n===History===\\nThe first human settlers are believed to have arrived in the area at around 7000 BCE, though this settlement was later abandoned. A subsequent wave of settlers, known as the Lenape people, would then arrive at around 1000 BCE. Although they have been largely wiped out from the area since the days of European settlement, many of the thoroughfares used by them, such as [[Broadway (street)|Broadway]], continue to be in use to this day.\\n\\nThe first Europeans to settle in the area were the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in 1609, who named the colony New Amsterdam ([[Dutch phrasebook|Dutch]]: ''Nieuw Amsterdam''). The colony was conquered by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1664, who re-named the colony New York. Columbia University, the most prestigious in the city, and one of the most prestigious in the United States, was founded during the British colonial period in 1754.\\n\\nFor much of the War of Independence, New York City remained a British stronghold. The British only withdrew from the city in 1783, allowing George Washington's troops to march in and claim it for the United States of America. New York City became the first capital of the United States of America in 1789, though this status was short-lived as the capital was transferred to [[Philadelphia]] only a year later. Nevertheless, during that period, the first United States Congress was convened at what is now Federal Hall on Wall Street, and George Washington was also inaugurated as the first President of the United States on the steps of Federal Hall. The Supreme Court of the United States was first convened at the now-demolished Royal Exchange Building, which was adjacent to Federal Hall.\\n\\n===Orientation===\\nThe borough of Manhattan is a long, narrow island nestled in a natural harbor. It is separated from The Bronx on the north east by the Harlem River (actually a tidal strait); from Queens and Brooklyn to the east and south by the East River (also a tidal strait); and from the State of New Jersey to the west and north by the Hudson River. Staten Island lies to the southwest, across Upper New York Bay.\\n\\nIn Manhattan, the terms \\u201cuptown\\u201d and \\u201cnorth\\u201d mean northeast, while \\u201cdowntown\\u201d and \\u201csouth\\u201d mean to the southwest. To avoid confusion, simply use \\u201cuptown\\u201d and \\u201cdowntown.\\u201d Street numbers continue from Manhattan into the Bronx, and the street numbers rise as one moves farther uptown (however, in the Bronx, there is no simple numerical grid, so there may be 7 blocks between 167 St. and 170 St., for example). Avenues run north and south. In Brooklyn, street numbers rise as one moves south. Queens streets are laid out in a perpendicular grid \\u2013 street numbers rise as one moves toward the east, and avenues run east and west. Staten Island's grid system is small and insignificant, only covering one neighborhood.\\n\\nThe term \\u201cthe city\\u201d may refer either to New York City as a whole, or to the borough of Manhattan alone, depending on the context. The other boroughs - Brooklyn, The Bronx, Staten Island, and Queens - are sometimes referred to as the \\\"outer boroughs.\\u201d\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Imperial\\n| janhigh =   39.5\\n| febhigh =   42.2\\n| marhigh =   49.9\\n| aprhigh =   61.8\\n| mayhigh =   71.4\\n| junhigh =   79.7\\n| julhigh =   84.9\\n| aughigh =   83.3\\n| sephigh =   76.2\\n| octhigh =   64.5\\n| novhigh =   54.0\\n| dechigh =   44.3\\n| janlow =    27.9\\n| feblow =    29.5\\n| marlow =    35.8\\n| aprlow =    45.5\\n| maylow =    55.0\\n| junlow =    64.4\\n| jullow =    70.1\\n| auglow =    68.9\\n| seplow =    62.3\\n| octlow =    51.4\\n| novlow =    42.0\\n| declow =    33.8\\n| janprecip =   3.64\\n| febprecip =   3.19\\n| marprecip =   4.29\\n| aprprecip =   4.09\\n| mayprecip =   3.96\\n| junprecip =   4.54\\n| julprecip =   4.60\\n| augprecip =   4.56\\n| sepprecip =   4.31\\n| octprecip =   4.38\\n| novprecip =   3.58\\n| decprecip =   4.38\\n| janh2o =\\n| febh2o =\\n| marh2o =\\n| aprh2o =\\n| mayh2o =\\n| junh2o =\\n| julh2o =b\\n| augh2o =\\n| seph2o =\\n| octh2o =\\n| novh2o =\\n| dech2o =\\n| description = {{forecastNOAA|New York|40.7142|-74.0059}}\\n}}\\n\\nThere has been a pronounced local warming trend in New York City since the 1990s, but the climate is still temperate, except in the summer. Due to its proximity to the humid continental climate zone of the north, it generally experiences all four seasons, with hot and humid summers (Jun-Sept), mild to cool falls (Sept-Nov), mild to very cold winters (Dec-Mar), and increasingly mild, wet springs (Mar-Jun). Average highs for January are around 38\\u00b0F (3\\u00b0C) and average highs for July are about 84\\u00b0F (29\\u00b0C). However, temperatures in the winter can go down to as low as 0\\u00b0F (-18\\u00b0C), although periods of sustained extreme cold with highs in the teens or low 20s for two weeks or more are increasingly a thing of the past, whereas what used to be freakish temperatures in the 70s in midwinter are increasingly common, and in the summer, temperatures can go above 100\\u00b0F (38\\u00b0C). Summer heat indices factoring in humidity are around {{F|87}} during the day and {{F|71}} at night, though it's not unheard of for heat indices to climb up to or exceed {{F|100}} and not go below {{F|78}} at night. The temperature in any season is quite variable and it is not unusual to have a sunny 60\\u00b0F (16\\u00b0C) day in January followed by a snowy 25\\u00b0F (-4\\u00b0C) day. New York can also be prone to snowstorms and nor'easters (large storms similar to a tropical storm), which can dump as much as 2 feet (60&nbsp;cm) of rain and/or snow in 24\\u201348 hours. Although snowstorms occur during the winter months, some winters see very little snow, and snow rarely lies more than a few days before it melts. Major snowstorms can happen as early as Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November) and as late as the second week in April, though this is increasingly rare and not the norm. Tropical storms can also hit New York City in the summer and early fall, and with climate change occurring apace, they can bring truly torrential rains that cause flooding in places. The sun is up during the summer from 5:30AM to 8:30PM, and 7:15AM to 4:30PM in the winter.\\n\\n===People===\\nThe diverse population runs the gamut from some of America's wealthiest celebrities and socialites to homeless people. New York's population, formed by millions of immigrants, has been diverse since the city's founding by the Dutch, and successive waves of immigration from virtually every nation in the world make New York a giant social experiment in cross-cultural harmony.\\n\\nThe city's ethnic heritage illuminates different neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs. Manhattan's Chinatown remains a vibrant center of New York City's Chinese community, though the very large Chinese community in Flushing, Queens, has rivaled if not eclipsed it in importance, and three other Chinatowns have formed in New York City: the Brooklyn Chinatown in Sunset Park; the Elmhurst Chinatown in Queens; and the Avenue U Chinatown in the Homecrest section of Brooklyn. Traces of the Lower East Side's once-thriving Jewish community still exist amid the gentrified neighborhood's trendy restaurants and bars, but there are Chasidic communities in Borough Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Harlem has been gentrifying and diversifying and remains a center of African-American culture in New York. East (Spanish) Harlem, though also significantly gentrified, still justifies its reputation as a large Hispanic neighborhood. Little known to most tourists are the large Dominican neighborhoods of Hamilton Heights and Washington Heights in upper Manhattan. Brooklyn's Greenpoint is famous for its formerly large and vibrant Polish community, of which only a bit remains, and the Flatbush section - once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers - is today a huge and thriving Caribbean and West Indian section. Queens and Brooklyn are known for being home to many of New York's immigrant groups, which since 1990 have included large numbers of Russians, Uzbeks, Chinese, Irish, French, Filipinos, Yugoslavians, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Japanese, Koreans, Thais, Africans, Arabs (from throughout the Middle East and northern Africa), Mexicans, Dominicans, Ecuadorians, Brazilians, Colombians and Jamaicans. Queens is the single most diverse area on Earth, having the most languages and ethnic groups living in one place.\\n\\n===Economy===\\nNew York City is home to 46 of the Fortune 500 companies. Its gross metropolitan product of $1.7 trillion is the largest of any American city and represents roughly 9% of the American economy. If it were a nation, the city would have the 16th-highest GDP in the world.\\n\\nNew York is the national center for several industries. It is the home of the three largest U.S. stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX) and many banking and investment firms. Though these companies have traditionally been located in the area around Wall Street in the Financial District, many have offices in other parts of the city, such as Midtown. New York is the hub of the country's publishing, fashion, accounting, advertising, media, legal, theater, and art industries. The city boasts several top-tier hospitals and medical schools, which train more physicians than those in any other city in the world.\\n\\n===Visitor information ===\\n*[https://www.nyctourism.com/ New York City Tourism]\\n\\n==Talk==\\nEnglish is the primary language spoken by most New Yorkers, although it is common to hear other languages from around the world. There are many [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]-speaking neighborhoods with large Latino populations (especially several neighborhoods in the Bronx, Bushwick, Corona, Jackson Heights, Washington Heights, East Harlem and West Harlem), and it is possible, albeit somewhat difficult, for a non-English-speaking tourist to get by in New York speaking only Spanish. Many establishments in the main commercial and tourist areas have Spanish-speaking staff on duty. Cantonese is the main language among New York City's Chinese community, though a significant minority are immigrants from [[Fuzhou]] and hence speak the [[Fuzhou dialect phrasebook|Fuzhou dialect]]; some speak [[Chinese phrasebook|Mandarin]]. You can expect to hear Russian spoken on the streets in parts of South Brooklyn, and [[Yiddish phrasebook|Yiddish]] or [[Hebrew phrasebook|Hebrew]] in other parts. In some of these neighborhoods, some locals may not speak very good English, but store owners and those who would deal frequently with tourists or visitors will generally speak English. Most municipal government services in New York City are available in English, Spanish, Chinese, and Russian. Because of a massive wave of immigration of Italians in the late 19th and early 20th century, Italian was once a major language \\u2014 primarily the southern dialects (Napuletano, Siciliano, Calabrese, etc.). You can still hear them in Italian neighborhoods, along with Italian-American dialects of the younger generations. The more standardized Italian has been brought by 21st-century immigrants who tend to be young business professionals, as opposed to the much larger wave of working class southern Italian immigrants before them.\\n\\nThe upside to this linguistic confusion is that, while you can find a restaurant or other establishment for nearly every culture somewhere in Manhattan, catering to English-speaking tourists, more adventurous travelers may be able to find a more authentic experience for less money among an ethnic community somewhere in the outer boroughs.\\n\\nTraditionally, English in New York City was spoken with distinctive accents, which differed according to ethnicity, neighborhood and social class (compare the Queens accent of Donald Trump with the Brooklyn accent of Bernie Sanders, both New Yorkers, as an example). Some of these accents are notable for being among the few non-rhotic American accents. You may still encounter the traditional accents when talking to older working-class New Yorkers. Due to its large Ashkenazi Jewish population, many Yiddish terms have also made their way into local English slang. You may also hear the New York dialect of '''African-American Vernacular English''' (AAVE) being spoken among African-Americans, and a distinctive dialect known as '''New York Latino English''', with noticeable influences from Puerto Rican and Dominican Spanish, is spoken by many Latinos. The long-established Jewish American and Italian-American communities have developed their own dialects that can still be heard throughout the city.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\nNew York City ({{IATA|NYC}} for [[Metropolitan Area Airport Codes|all airports]]) is well connected by air with flights from almost every corner of the world. Three large airports, and several small ones, serve the region. John F. Kennedy International Airport ({{IATA|JFK}}) and Newark Liberty International Airport ({{IATA|EWR}}) are large international airports, while LaGuardia Airport ({{IATA|LGA}}) is a busy domestic airport. All three airports are run by [https://www.panynj.gov/port-authority/en/index.html The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey].\\n\\nInter-airport transfers:\\n* '''Bus/subway''' - Connections between airports using the bus/subway/PATH trains are the cheapest option, but will require many transfers.

A taxi between JFK and LGA will cost about $25\\u201329 and should take 30 minutes. A taxi between LGA and EWR will cost about $78 + tolls and should take 60\\u201375 minutes. A taxi between JFK and EWR will cost about $85 + tolls and should take 60\\u201375 minutes.\\n\\n{{cautionbox|'''Taxi scammers'''\\n\\nScammers outside of the arrivals terminals at JFK will offer their services, claiming to be Uber drivers and that their original fare cancelled their ride. In many cases they will show the Uber logo either on a sign or on a smartphone. \\n\\n''Under no circumstances should you accept such offers!'' These people are not Uber drivers and many of them are not even licensed taxi drivers.

Make sure you know what terminal you're leaving from before you get to the airport, and it's recommended that you arrive 2 hours before domestic flights and 3 hours before international ones, to check in and pass through security without a huge increase in blood pressure and/or a last minute dash worthy of the Olympics, but without any of the medals.\\n\\nIf you're going to Manhattan, you can get there by '''taxi''' for a flat fare of $70, '''bus plus subway''' for $2.90, or the '''AirTrain''' \\u2014 a 24-hr people mover system that takes passengers to the nearby '''Jamaica''' subway and LIRR stations for $8 (AirTrain + subway card). From Jamaica you can take NYC subway lines E, J or Z further into [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]] and onward to the island of [[Manhattan]], with travel time being between 50 and 60 minutes to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan. A faster option for those in the know is the '''Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)'''; these commuter trains can whisk you from Jamaica to Penn Station in roughly 20-25 minutes. Jamaica is a ''major'' hub for LIRR train services \\u2014 only use this option if you are sure of what you're doing. You don't want to get on the wrong train and end up far from your destination. To add insult to injury, unforgiving conductors on the LIRR will charge you on the spot for incorrect tickets. Best to use this option once you have fully done your research or consulted with a local. LIRR trains are extremely crowded both toward and away from New York City during rush hours. \\n\\nTraffic can be horrendous at all hours, in all directions.

Trips via the Queens-Midtown Tunnel or RFK Bridge will incur a toll in addition to the fare. Traffic between Manhattan and LaGuardia can be awful during rush hours but generally is not a big issue outside of peak commuting times. If you feel comfortable using public transportation, two MTA Select Bus Service routes serve the airport. These buses can be very crowded at times but they do include luggage racks and operate 24 hours a day with a fair degree of frequency. The '''M60-SBS''' can take you to the area of Upper Manhattan around Columbia University via the Astoria neighborhood of Queens and 125th Street in Harlem.

The trip takes 6\\u20137 days and costs $800\\u20136,000 depending on the cabin and season.\\n*More mundane arrivals can be had from New Jersey via '''NY Waterway''' and '''SeaStreak''', two fast ferry services.\\n\\n===By car===\\nWhile most people would advise against entering New York City by car (see the \\\"Get around\\\" section below), it is accessible by a number of highways:\\n\\nFrom New Jersey there are three Hudson River crossings: The George Washington Bridge (on I-95, US 1 and US 9) in [[Fort Lee]] drops you off in [[Manhattan/Harlem and Upper Manhattan|Upper Manhattan]], the Lincoln Tunnel (on NJ Route 495) in [[Weehawken]] will bring you to [[Manhattan/Theater District|Midtown Manhattan]], and the Holland Tunnel (on I-78) in [[Jersey City]] leaves you in [[Manhattan/TriBeCa|lower Manhattan]]. Depending on where you are heading to in New York City and the time of day, you'll want to take advantage of the different crossings, but if you have the time and are looking for the most scenic of the three, take the George Washington Bridge's upper level for spectacular views of New York City; Hudson County, New Jersey; and the Hudson River. If you are heading to Staten Island, Queens or Brooklyn you can also take the Goethals Bridge (on I-278) in [[Elizabeth]]; the highway cuts across Staten Island and continues over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to Brooklyn. The other routes into Staten Island from NJ are the Outerbridge Crossing in [[Perth Amboy]], which puts you in Tottenville near the southern tip of the island, and the [[Bayonne (New Jersey)|Bayonne]] Bridge, which leaves you in extreme northern Staten Island.\\n\\nFrom Upstate New York, you can take one of several highways into the Bronx, including the New York State Thruway, which becomes the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx (both roads are I-87). The Connecticut Turnpike/New England Thruway (I-95) and the Merritt Parkway/Hutchinson River Parkway are good routes from [[Connecticut]] and areas of [[Westchester County]] near the Long Island Sound. From [[Long Island]] you can take the Long Island Expressway (I-495) or the Northern State Parkway/Grand Central Parkway for access to Queens, the Bronx and Manhattan. The Southern State and Belt Parkways are useful for Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n{{infobox|\\\"Left luggage\\\"|Because of security concerns, there are very few left luggage, storage lockers, or coat-check service at ''any'' New York train station.

If you use the subway or buses, you will almost certainly need to walk to and from stations or stops.

If you tap in with a physical credit card the first time, you can not use that same credit card loaded on a mobile wallet for a second tap (including to transfer between buses or the subway); you must still use the physical card. OMNY uses a large reader module with an LCD display mounted to the front of subway turnstiles and beside fare boxes on local buses. On Select Bus Service vehicles, OMNY readers are situated beside all boarding doorways; you do not need to utilize the SBS ticket machines found at stops. OMNY offers a [https://omny.info/faq/fare-cap fare cap]: if you take 12 paid OMNY trips with the same device or card within a 7-day window, you\\u2019ll automatically ride free for the rest of the week. [https://new.mta.info/fares/reduced-fare/omny Reduced fares] are available on OMNY; riders eligible for a reduced fare need to specify a single payment device which will be charged their lower fare.\\n\\nPATH trains between New Jersey and New York City offer two contactless payment methods. You can use a contactless payment device such as a credit card or smartphone wallets on the '''[https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/fares.html Total Access PATH Payment (TAPP)]''' trial gates, or use a physical RFID card called '''[https://www.pathsmartlinkcard.com/ SmartLink]'''. Smartlink cards will NOT work on contactless OMNY readers for MTA subways or buses once in New York City, so visitors moving between New Jersey and New York City frequently may prefer the convenience of TAPP.\\n\\n'''MetroCard''' is the tried-and-true pre-paid debit card for transit fares that will be phased out by 2024. MetroCards, which cost $1, can be bought online, at station booths, and at vending machines in subway stations, as well as at newsstands and some bodegas and convenience stores. The vending machines in the stations accept credit cards; however, MetroCard vending machines will require that you type in your 5-digit zip code, or your regular PIN on international cards. You can add either value or time (i.e. unlimited trips) to your MetroCard at vending machines in stations. Unlimited Ride MetroCards may not be used in rapid succession at the same subway station or on the same bus route. MetroCards generally expire 1 year after purchase; the expiration date is printed on the back of the card at the upper left.\\n\\nThe PATH rapid transit rail system between New York and New Jersey has a separate fare structure. PATH accepts payment by MetroCard, but no free transfers are available to or from MTA subways or buses. JFK AirTrain also accepts MetroCard, but again there are no free transfers available.\\n\\nMetro-North Commuter Railroad, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), New Jersey Transit (NJT), and Amtrak trains do not accept MetroCards, but Westchester Bee Line Buses, Roosevelt Island Tram, and NICE Bus (Nassau Inter-County Express) do [http://web.mta.info/metrocard/where_accept.htm accept]{{Dead link|date=November 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} them.

However, expired MetroCards can be exchanged at station booths and vending machines free of charge, and the remaining balance will also be transferred to the new card. Most vending machines accept cash, but only return up to $9 in change. Debit and credit cards are accepted at vending machines; international card users need to input '99999' on the keypad when the ZIP code is requested. However, staffed station booths only accept cash, and no $50 bill if buying less than $30 or $100 bill if buying less than $70.\\n\\n*'''Single Ride MetroCard''' \\u2013 costs $3 and is good for one use. It allows no free transfers between the subway and bus, and it is only valid for two hours after purchase.\\n*'''Pay-Per-Ride (Regular) MetroCards''' \\u2013 are available in amounts from $5.50 to $80. Each local bus or subway trip deducts $2.90 from your card; each express buses trip deducts $6.75. Usage of the PATH system deducts $2.75, and usage of JFK AirTrain deducts $8.25. You can add more money to your MetroCard at a later time.\\nThe amount you should add is (''number of rides'' &times; $2.90).

Many subway connections are possible in this way, by using in-station connections between the various lines.

Just remember that if you leave the subway and re-enter, you will be charged a second fare.\\n\\n:Additionally, if you board a local bus and pay the $2.90 fare with a MetroCard, you can transfer to an express bus for the reduced price of $4.10 (instead of the standard $7 express bus fare).\\n\\n*'''Unlimited Ride MetroCards''' \\u2013 are available in 7-day ($33) and 30-day ($127).

Do the math; these cards may work out to be cheaper if you plan on using public transport frequently during your stay. For example, the 7-day pass is worth it if you take at least 12 rides. It works out to roughly two trips every day for a week, so those who commute round-trip within the city every day for one week can benefit from this. Unlimited Ride MetroCards may not be used in rapid succession at the same subway station or on the same bus route. Once used, 18 minutes must elapse before it can be used at the same station (or on the same bus route). This is to prevent a group of people from sharing a single Unlimited Ride MetroCard. Hence, each member of the group will require their own Unlimited Ride MetroCard. Unlimited Ride MetroCards are NOT valid on express buses, JFK AirTrain, or PATH trains to New Jersey. If you are arriving at JFK Airport and take the AirTrain, the machines at the station do not sell Unlimited Ride cards. You should pay for the AirTrain ($5) and buy an unlimited card at the subway station.\\n*'''7-Day Express Bus Plus''' \\u2013 costs $62 and allows unlimited use of not just local buses and subways, but also express buses. If you are staying in Staten Island, Queens, or Westchester county and plan to commute to the city during your visit, this pass may be advantageous to you.\\n*Also available are two passes good only for unlimited use of the ''JFK AirTrain'': a 30-day unlimited AirTrain pass for $40, and a 10-trip pass for $25.\\n*'''Reduced fares''' (50% off) for either MetroCard or OMNY are available for those 65 and over or those with a covered disability. They can be attained via [https://new.mta.info/fares/reduced-fare online or mail application] ahead of time, visiting the MTA's main customer service office at 3 Stone Street at the southern tip of Manhattan near Battery Park, or (for temporary cards of one month) at a Customer Service Center at one of fifteen NYC Subway stations across the system (see list [https://new.mta.info/contact-us/customer-service-centers here]). Photo ID proof is required.\\n\\nYou can also get discounted tickets to certain events by showing your MetroCard when purchasing tickets. Current promotions are listed on [http://www.mta.info/metrocard/tourism/mc_promotions.htm the MetroCard website]\\n\\n====By subway====\\n[[Image:NYC subway-4D.svg|thumb|550px|Map of the New York City Subway and Staten Island Railway]]\\nDespite a reputation for being dirty, the subway, which operates 24 hours a day 7 days a week, is the fastest and best way to travel around four boroughs of the city. Unfortunately for people who live there, it doesn't reach Staten Island, which is instead served by a [[#By the Staten Island Railway|separate railway]]. Fares are $2.90 (unless you use Single Ride MetroCard, which is $3), regardless of distance traveled. The much-feared subway crimes of the 1970s and 1980s are for the most part a thing of the past, and it is usually completely safe. Just remember to use common sense when traveling late at night alone. Try to use heavily-traveled stations, remain visible to other people, and don't display items of value publicly. While violent crime is rare, petty crime - especially theft of iPhones and other expensive electronics - is very frequent, so be aware when using your phone on the train.\\n\\n* '''Overhead signage''' next to each track indicates the trains that stop at that particular track and the direction they are heading. In addition, the trains are marked by signage that indicates their route. Subway stations are ventilated to the street, so they can be quite cold in the winter. In summertime, the stations can be much warmer than the outside temperature. The trains themselves are air-conditioned and usually quite comfortable, but keep the temperature of stations in mind when planning your trip.\\n* Some stations, especially local-only ones, have '''entrances''' which provide access to trains headed in one direction, not both. Read the signage outside the entrance to know which direction the train heads toward. If it heads in the opposite direction of where you need to go, enter across the street.\\n* Some trains are '''express''', meaning that they skip local stations to provide faster service. Wherever there is an express train, there is also a '''local''' train that makes all stops. Local and express trains often use different tracks, so be sure to board the correct train For example, the 2 and 3 are the express trains for the Broadway\\u20137th Avenue Line between 96th Street and Chambers Street in Manhattan, while the 1 runs local alongside them. Some express trains run local or do not run at all late at night, and there are some lines in which there is an express train only during rush hours, in one direction. These trains either use a diamond-shaped icon instead of a circle-shaped one or are the Z train.\\n* During weekends and late nights, certain trains do not operate or operate on a '''limited schedule or route''', many express trains make local stops, and some subway entrances are closed. Detailed information is available on [http://www.mta.info the MTA website]. Additionally, maintenance work is usually concentrated on weekends and overnight. Notices of maintenance are posted at stations and on [http://travel.mtanyct.info/serviceadvisory/ the MTA website]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}, so check online to avoid unpleasant surprises. Remember, if you do feel confused, ask for help. Construction-related service changes confuse many New Yorkers, so the best person to ask is a subway employee. The entire subway system is massive and interconnected, so do not fear \\u2014 there will almost always be another way to get to your destination without spending hours on the train.\\n* A free '''subway map''' can be [http://web.mta.info/maps/submap.html found online], or obtained at staffed station booths. Station agents can also assist you with directions, although agents may not always be easy to find. Free bus system maps for each borough, which are also available on the MTA website and from most bus drivers and some subway station booths, double as fairly good street maps that show the exact location of every subway station. Additionally, for convenience, subway maps are displayed in every station and on every train. Some stations also have touchscreen information panels that feature route planners.\\n* If you accidentally skip your destination, ''don't panic''. Get off at the next station and ''do not go out onto the street'' to try to get to the opposite platform. Doing so will not count as a transfer and you will be charged for the MetroCard swipe. Instead, navigate underground to get to the other platform, following the signs. As mentioned above, some stations do not have passage between the platforms; in this case, ask a subway employee which station ahead does let you cross over, wait for the next train there, then cross over. Tell them which station you are trying to get to, because they may suggest a different subway line that can get you there faster; since you are coming back, it does not matter which line you take if you transfer back to your original line.\\n* If you see an empty car despite the fact that the rest of the train is crowded, you should avoid riding in that car. This usually means that there is a strong bad smell in that car.\\n* If you don't feel completely safe, such as if you are traveling very late at night, look for the '''black-and-white striped bar''' mounted on the wall or hanging from the ceiling of the station which marks the location of the conductor's car, and board there. Generally, every car will be equally safe, but you may feel better with another pair of eyes nearby.\\n\\n=====Route overview=====\\nSubway lines are not referred to by color. Instead, each route is identified by either a letter or a number; the color refers to the set of tracks used by the route, and older New Yorkers in particular also often identify routes by the line they travel on, as shown below. It is possible for a service to be diverted to a different route, especially during weekends and maintainance periods. Numbered routes use narrower train cars than lettered routes. \\n\\n* The Seventh Avenue Line ({{rint|nycs|1}}{{rint|nycs|2}}{{rint|nycs|3}}) serves Broadway above 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue below 42nd Street, and is useful to get to the West Village, Chelsea, and Tribeca neighborhoods as well as the Staten Island or Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty ferries (1 to South Ferry station) and Columbia University (1 to 116th Street station). In Manhattan, the 1 train is local, while the 2 and 3 trains are express. Late nights, all routes may run local.\\n* The Lexington Avenue Line trains ({{rint|nycs|4}}{{rint|nycs|5}}{{rint|nycs|6}}{{rint|nycs|6d}}) were essentially the only trains on the East Side above 23 Street until the construction of the Q Second Avenue Subway (see below). Useful to get to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (4, 5, or 6 to 86th Street station or 6 to 77th Street station), Guggenheim Museum (4, 5, or 6 to 86th Street station), and other East Side museums. Also useful to get to the Statue of Liberty (4 or 5 to Bowling Green station), Chinatown (6 to Canal Street station), and the Stock Exchange (4 or 5 to Wall Street station). The 4 also runs uptown through Spanish Harlem to 161 Street\\u2013Yankee Stadium and other destinations in the Bronx. In Manhattan, the 4 and 5 trains are express, and the 6 train is local.\\n* The Flushing Line ({{rint|nycs|7}}{{rint|nycs|7d}}), dubbed the \\\"International Express\\\", runs crosstown along 42nd Street (making a good late-night alternative to the upstairs Shuttle \\u2013 see below) and out to Queens, making stops in Filipino, South Asian, Hispanic, and Chinese/Korean neighborhoods. The penultimate stop on the line serves Citi Field and the USTA Billie Jean King Tennis Center. The 7 train is local, as it is the only route that operates on that line; however, it does offer express service during rush hours, toward Manhattan in the morning and toward Flushing in the afternoon.\\n* The Eighth Avenue Line ({{rint|nycs|a}}{{rint|nycs|c}}{{rint|nycs|e}}) serves Eighth Avenue/Central Park West between 14th and 116th Streets, then St. Nicholas Av., Broadway, and Ft. Washington Av. starting at 125th St. in [[Manhattan/Harlem and Upper Manhattan|Harlem]]. Between 50th and 59th streets, the E branches off to Queens, and the B and D trains join the A and C trains for the journey uptown along Central Park West (the B and C make local stops). This section is useful to get to the Museum of Natural History (B or C to 81st Street station), and the Cloisters Museum (A to 190th Street station). Take an uptown E train or Rockaway-bound downtown A train for access to JFK Airport. In Manhattan, except late nights, 'the A train is express, while the C and E trains are local.However, the E is the fastest express train in Queens, very useful for access to Jamaica and JFK if you are coming from Midtown.\\n* The Sixth Avenue Line ({{rint|nycs|b}}{{rint|nycs|d}}{{rint|nycs|f}}{{rint|nycs|fd}}{{rint|nycs|m}}) runs on 6th Avenue from West 4th Street to 47th\\u201350th Streets, and is useful for accessing the New York Public Library Main Branch (42nd Street station), Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and St. Patrick's Cathedral (47th\\u201350th Sts. station). In Manhattan, the D is express, the B is local above 59th St., and the F and M trains are local.\\n**Going downtown below West 4th Street, these trains go on their own separate ways. The D goes down 4th Avenue in Brooklyn to Coney Island. The F goes to Coney Island on its own route. The B goes express in Brooklyn and ends at Brighton Beach alongside the Q train, which also goes to Coney Island. The M goes east alongside the Nassau Street line (see below), but then branches again up Myrtle Avenue to Middle Village in Queens.\\n**Going uptown, the B and D trains branch west and join the A and C trains (see above). They branch again toward the Bronx after 145th Street (which is the way to get to the 161 St\\u2013Yankee Stadium stop). The M train branches east and joins the E along 53rd street for the Museum of Modern Art (5 Av/53 St station), then heads off to Queens. The F train makes one more 6th Avenue stop at 57th Street before turning east to become an express train in Queens, making a stop at [[Manhattan/Roosevelt Island#Roosevelt Island|Roosevelt Island]] and joining the E, M, and R trains.\\n* The Nassau Street Line ({{rint|nycs|j}}{{rint|nycs|z}}) starts at Broad Street and goes along Nassau Street in Lower Manhattan before making stops along Broadway and Fulton Street in Brooklyn (not Broadway in Manhattan) and terminating in the Jamaica area of Queens. It's useful if you are transferring from a train that doesn't serve Lower Manhattan, but also if you are going to parts of Brooklyn or Queens. The J train is local, and the Z train is a skip-stop train that only operates during rush hour.\\n* The Broadway Line ({{rint|nycs|n}}{{rint|nycs|q}}{{rint|nycs|r}}{{rint|nycs|w}}) runs down Broadway below 42nd Street and on Seventh Avenue and 59th Street above Times Square. The Broadway Line trains are useful for accessing Chinatown (Canal St), SoHo/NoHo (Prince St), NYU area (8th St), Union Square (14th St), the Empire State Building (34th St), Times Square (42nd St), Carnegie Hall (57th St\\u20137th Av station), Central Park (57th St\\u20137th Av and 5th Av/59th St stations) and the southern end of the Upper East Side (5th Av/59th St and Lexington Av/59th St stations). The Q train goes further uptown through the Upper East Side via the new Second Avenue Line, while the N and W trains head out to [[Queens/Long Island City and Astoria|Astoria, Queens]]. The R also goes up past Astoria to [[Queens/Jackson Heights|Jackson Heights]] and beyond, and is joined by the W down through the [[Manhattan/Financial District|Financial District]] and South Ferry (Whitehall St). Like the D and F trains, the N and Q trains also provide service to Coney Island via their own separate routes: The N goes solo, and the Q runs alongside the B (see above). In Manhattan, 'the N and Q trains are express and the R and W trains are local. However, the W train only operates on weekdays. The  usually runs local late nights, and sometimes the Q does, too.\\n* The Canarsie Line ({{rint|nycs|l}}) is a local line that runs crosstown along 14th Street in Manhattan, then through [[Brooklyn/Williamsburg|Williamsburg]] and Bushwick and eventually to Canarsie in Brooklyn.\\n* The Crosstown Line ({{rint|nycs|g}}) is a local line that runs along most of Western Brooklyn and into Long Island City in Queens. At no point on its route does it stop in Manhattan.\\n* There are three Shuttles ([[File:NYCS-bull-trans-S.svg|20px]]) in the system. The 42nd Street Shuttle stops only at Times Square on the West Side and Grand Central Terminal on the East Side. The Franklin Avenue Shuttle in Brooklyn makes four stops \\u2013 at Fulton Street (transfer to C), Park Place, Botanical Gardens (transfer to 2, 3, 4, and 5), and Prospect Park (transfer to B and Q). The Rockaway Park Shuttle connects with the A train at Broad Channel before branching off toward Beach\\u2013116th Street on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens.\\n\\n====By PATH====\\n'''[https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/index.html PATH]''' (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) trains primarily provide commuter service between urban Northern New Jersey and Manhattan in two branches\\u2014one connecting the city of Newark with the World Trade Center and a branch connecting the smaller enclaves of Hoboken and Jersey City with the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. PATH trains ''can'' be used to travel within Manhattan along a segment running under Sixth Avenue, although realistically there's no reason to use this service unless the Sixth Avenue subway line ({{rint|nycs|b}}{{rint|nycs|d}}{{rint|nycs|f}}{{rint|nycs|fd}}{{rint|nycs|m}}) is severely delayed or disrupted. Manhattan PATH stations are cramped and dusty; expect extremely crowded conditions during rush hours. Unlimited Ride MetroCards ''cannot'' be used on the PATH. PATH also accepts the SmartLink Card (similar to the MetroCard, but the SmartLink Card cannot be used on the NYC subway), and accepts contactless payment directly using credit cards, smartphone taps, etc at the TAPP gates. Like the subway, PATH operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. PATH trains usually arrive every 5\\u201310 minutes (based on the time of day), but overnight, they may only come every 35 minutes.\\n\\n====By the Staten Island Railway====\\nThe '''[https://new.mta.info/agency/staten-island-railway Staten Island Railway]''', true to its name, is a railway line that serves Staten Island. It is owned and operated by the MTA. It is free ''except'' at the Tompkinsville and St. George stations. There, the price is the same as the subway ($2.90), and is payable by MetroCard (free transfers from MTA buses work, just as is the case with subways). SIR departure times from the terminal at St. George are usually coordinated with those of the [[#By ferry|Staten Island Ferry]]. The SIR consists of one line that travels along the East Shore of Staten Island, ending at Tottenville. A full timetable with other information can be found [http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/pdf/sircur.pdf here]{{Dead link|date=December 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}.\\n\\n====By commuter rail====\\nCommuter rail lines are mostly used for traveling between the city and its suburbs, owing to the vast existence of the Subway; however, they can be used for intracity transit as well. A handful of destinations are closer to commuter rail stops but far from the subway. MetroCards are ''not'' accepted on commuter rail; separate single or period tickets ''must'' be bought. When purchasing commuter railroad tickets, it is advantageous to purchase them online or in railroad stations prior to boarding. While tickets are available for sale on trains, there is an on-board surcharge that makes them significantly more expensive.\\n\\nThe '''[https://new.mta.info/agency/long-island-rail-road Long Island Rail Road]''', often called the '''LIRR''' runs from Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, Atlantic Terminal in Downtown Brooklyn, and has limited rush hour service to Long Island City, Queens. The Port Washington Branch goes to [[Queens/Flushing-Northeast|Northeast Queens]] which, aside from Flushing and Citi Field, is not served by the subway system. The Main Line, which contains most of the branches to the different parts of Long Island, goes to [[Queens/Jamaica|Southeastern Queens]], including Jamaica, Laurelton, and Rosedale. The Atlantic Branch, which ends in [[Brooklyn/Downtown|Downtown Brooklyn]], goes to [[Brooklyn/East|East New York]] and [[Brooklyn/Bedford-Stuyvesant and Flatbush|Bedford-Stuyvesant]], both in [[Brooklyn]]. This branch is not accessible from Manhattan, however. The LIRR is also the fastest way to get from JFK to Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens, and also runs to many popular getaways in [[Long Island]], such as Long Beach, Port Jefferson, and Montauk. The LIRR has a somewhat deserved reputation for poor on-time performance, however this is more of a problem in the farther eastern reaches of the railroad and not so much a problem in New York City and its immediate suburbs.\\n\\nThe '''[https://new.mta.info/agency/metro-north-railroad Metro-North Railroad]''' provides services from Grand Central Terminal. Trains go to the Bronx and the northern suburbs of the city. The Hudson Line covers several parts of the Western Bronx, while the Harlem Line goes through the Central Bronx \\u2014 an area with no subway service. It is the best way to get to Arthur Avenue and the New York Botanic Gardens. The Hudson and Harlem Lines are also your gateway to [[Westchester County]] and beyond, with the Hudson Line running all the way to [[Poughkeepsie]]. The New Haven Line runs to [[Connecticut]], terminating, logically enough, in [[New Haven]].\\n\\nHowever, the other commuter railroad, '''NJ Transit Rail Operations''' only operates between Penn Station or places like [[Newark]] and [[Hoboken]] (both in New Jersey) to other points in [[New Jersey]]. Hence the name, NJ Transit.\\n\\n====By bus====\\nEven in Manhattan, with its dense subway network, buses can often be the best way of making a crosstown (i.e. east-west) journey \\u2014 for example, crossing Central Park to go from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Museum of Natural History. And outside peak hours, a ride by bus from the tip of Lower Manhattan at Battery Park to Midtown is a good and cheap way of taking in the sights.\\n\\n=====Bus basics=====\\n* Bus lines are identified by letters followed by numbers. The letters indicate the borough in which the line mostly operates (M=Manhattan; Bx=Bronx; B=Brooklyn; Q=Queens; S=Staten Island). Collectively, the letters and numbers make up the route (examples: M31, Bx9, M15). Signage at each bus stop indicates which buses stop there. Signage on the front of each bus indicates the route and destination of the bus. Bus maps for each borough can be found at the [https://new.mta.info/maps/bus MTA website].\\n* Express buses travel between Manhattan and the outer boroughs, usually to areas where the subway doesn't operate (such as eastern Queens, the eastern Bronx, southeast Brooklyn, and Staten Island). They cost $6.75 but offer comfortable cloth seats and Wi-Fi, and are less crowded than the subway and local buses. Most express buses are identified by the borough they connect to Manhattan. Therefore, express buses to and from the Bronx would be labeled BxM (<u>Bx</u> for the <u>B</u>ron<u>x</u>, <u>M</u> for <u>M</u>anhattan; BxM11, BxM18), to and from Brooklyn BM (BM1, BM2), to and from Queens QM (QM1, QM2), and to and from Staten Island SIM (SIM1, SIM2). A few Brooklyn and Queens express buses are labeled with X (X27, X64). Express buses have a slightly different appearance than normal buses, with only one entrance/exit in the front of the bus.\\n* The times posted on bus stops are often very unreliable, and may have nothing to do with the times the buses actually arrive. You can check the positions of the buses and their distance from a given stop online using [http://bustime.mta.info/ MTA Bus Time]. Each stop also has a QR code, with a link to that stop's entry.\\n* At night, there is a much longer wait time between buses. If you anticipate riding the bus at night, plan an alternate route, probably via [[#By subway|subway]] or [[#By taxi|taxi]].\\n* When boarding a bus with a MetroCard, insert the card vertically, with the pin hole down, the black stripe to the right, and the word \\\"MetroCard\\\" facing towards you, into the card slot in the top of the fare box next to the driver. You should be able to read the word \\\"MetroCard\\\" from bottom to top when inserting the card in this manner. The fare box will swallow the card, read it, and return it to you. This is different from the procedure to enter the subway described in [[#Subway Basics|Subway Basics]].\\n* Bus fareboxes also accept coins. However, they will not accept pennies, half dollar (50-cent) coins, or bills. As a safety precaution, drivers do not handle money. Change is not given, so exact fares must be paid. If you pay with coins and require a free transfer, you will have to ask the driver for one after you have paid.\\n* Certain buses contain a small orange and purple card in the window that says \\\"Limited.\\\" These limited buses do not make all local bus stops, stopping only at major cross streets. They are similar to express buses in some ways, but only cost the standard $2.90 to ride. If a Limited bus skips your stop, you can wait for a local bus which will arrive soon. On some avenues served by multiple bus routes, some buses may operate Limited on the entire avenue or at least until they branch off. For example, with the M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5, the M2 and M5 provide limited-stop service on 5th Ave & Madison Ave during the day.\\n\\n[[File:Ticketing Machines for Select Bus Service.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Select bus service fares are paid before boarding at ticket machines at bus stops]]\\n*'''[http://web.mta.info/mta/planning/sbs/ Select Bus Service (SBS)]''' routes also make limited stops and cost the standard $2.90 fare. These include the M14A, M14D, M15, M23, M34, M34A, M79, and M86 in Manhattan, the M60 in Manhattan and Queens, and several more routes in the outer boroughs. SBS routes can be identified by a special blue wrap around the lower half of the bus. ''However, these buses operate on a very different payment system''. To board these SBS buses, ''fares must be paid before boarding'' using machines on the sidewalk at a special SBS bus stop, which is typically quite close to the local bus stop. Follow the instructions at the machine to pay. Once the fare has been paid, a receipt will be printed; ''take it and keep it with you''. If you have an unlimited (daily, weekly, monthly) metro card, you can use it to get a ticket at no cost. You may also use OMNY to pay SBS fares by entering the bus through any door and tapping the reader. Once the bus arrives, you can enter through any door, but if you paid with cash, remember to use the front door if you need to ask the driver for a transfer. Fare inspectors will occasionally check for your fare receipt as proof of payment; show it to them if they ask. If you don't have a valid receipt, you will be forced to pay a fine of up to $100, so it is wise to always pay the fare. However, if you cannot buy the ticket successfully, such as due to a malfunctioning machine, note the machine number and report the problem to the bus driver near the front door at once. If the SBS skips your stop, wait at a local bus stop for a local bus.\\n*'''Transfers''' bus-to-bus, bus-to-subway, subway-to-bus transfers are automatic with metrocard payments within two hours of a swipe (i.e., within two hours of entering the subway or boarding a bus). If paying with coins on a bus, ask the driver for a bus-to-bus transfer (a single use metrocard). Transfers to and from the subway to a bus are not available if you pay cash or use a single use metrocard.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\nTaxis are widely available in New York, but due to surface traffic, it is often quicker to take the subway \\u2014 or in Midtown Manhattan, to walk.\\n* '''Yellow Cabs''' cruise in most of Manhattan and are available at dispatcher lines at airports, but are harder to find in the other four boroughs. Real NYC taxis are yellow, have a metal seal on the hood (\\\"medallion\\\"), a light with a taxi number on the roof, a meter for billing, stickers on the windshield for various licenses, special taxi license plates, and a divider inside the car. The fares are $2.50 plus a $0.50 state tax to start, plus $0.40 for each 1/5 mile traveled. There is a night surcharge from 8PM to 6AM of $0.50 and a rush hour surcharge of $1 M-F 4-8PM. In addition, as in the rest of the United States, tipping your taxi driver is expected in New York. For more information, see [[United States of America#Tipping|Tipping in the United States]]. Info on fares, flat fares, group rides and rules are [http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rate.shtml online]. All yellow cabs accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express for payment. In the unlikely event that the card reader is broken, the driver will let you know before you get into the taxi. To hail a taxi, stand visibly near the street (but away from moving traffic) with one arm raised over your head. The medallion numbers on the roof of the taxi will indicate the status of the taxi:\\n** If the medallion number is unlit, then the taxi is already occupied or otherwise unavailable.\\n** If the medallion number is lit, then the taxi is available for hire.\\n[[File:51st St 3rd Av td 36.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A borough taxi, which can be identified by its light green color]]\\n* '''Borough Taxis''' were introduced in 2013 to address the shortage of yellow cabs outside Manhattan. Unlike yellow cabs, they are light green and have no medallions on the hood. These cabs are barred from picking up passengers in Manhattan south of West 110th St or East 96th St and may not enter the airport dispatcher lines. They can, however, pick up passengers in northern Manhattan and the other boroughs, and can drop off passengers anywhere. Fares and rules are otherwise identical to yellow cabs.\\n* '''Livery or Black Cars''', known as car services or livery cabs, may only be called by phone, and are flat rate rather than metered. In most areas, they are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares, although sometimes they will do so anyway. Ask for the fare while on the phone. Their license plates will say either \\\"Livery\\\" or \\\"TLC\\\" on the bottom.\\n*'''Ride Hailing Smartphone App Services,''' such as [[Ride hailing services|Uber, Lyft and Via]] are extremely popular. Many drivers of black livery cars also use them to secure passengers when their own dispatchers are idle, so it's often possible to get a car from them in under ten minutes even in outer neighborhoods. Beware that most such services use variable-rate (aka \\\"surge\\\") pricing, and even small local increases in demand such as a concert letting out can trigger a 1.5x to 3x fare increase: always provide a destination address when hailing a car via an app, and examine the estimated fare carefully! Using these apps requires a smartphone with a working data connection (potentially expensive if you are roaming on an international account), and a credit card which you have entered into the app: you cannot pay the fare in cash.\\n\\nIn some areas, livery cabs can be flagged on the street. Though this is not legal (the driver, not you, could get into trouble), it is useful in upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs and is accepted practice, though this has mostly been replaced by the Borough Taxis and ride hailing apps. The minimum fare in these cabs is about $7, and it is advisable to negotiate the fare before you get inside (again, tipping your driver is expected). Since yellow cabs are hard to come by in the outer boroughs, these cars are particularly useful for getting to the airport (your hotel can arrange one, or look up car services in the Yellow Pages).\\n\\n====Taxi basics====\\n*All licensed taxis (yellow for in Manhattan and Green for outside of Manhattan) and sedan limousines are authorized to take 3 passengers in the backseat and 1 in the front seat for a total of 4. However, some of the newer minivan and SUV yellow cabs can seat more passengers and may take more than four passengers (even though the licensed limit is posted in the cab). Larger than sedan limousines can be reserved, also useful for airport trips with lots of luggage, by calling any of the dozens of companies in the yellow pages.\\n*Licensed taxis apply surcharges (in addition to the metered fare) depending on the time of day. From 6AM\\u20134PM, the surcharge is $0.50; from 4\\u20138PM, the surcharge is $1.50; from 8PM\\u20136AM the surcharge is $1. For all cabs, you must pay tolls for bridges, tunnels and highways. Be careful of being overcharged by drivers for toll crossings\\u2014on some bridges and tunnels (like the Queens-Midtown Tunnel) rates are not posted in plain view. So, a crossing which actually cost the cab driver $4 is easily passed onto the unsuspecting passenger as a $5 charge. Outside the city, other than flat fare destinations (such as JFK Airport and Newark Airport), meter rates are doubled (when going to Westchester or Nassau County). Tipping your driver is expected. The customary amount is 15% of the total fare, or more if you need to transport luggage or are going to a remote area of the city (where the cab driver will have a difficult time getting a return passenger). If you chose to use the credit card machine that is found in most taxis (it doubles as a TV screen, the default tip will be 20% or 25% but you can adjust this if you resist feeling pressured and punch in the desired amount.\\n*Be wary of unlicensed cars (known derisively as \\\"gypsy cabs\\\") cruising for passengers, especially near the airports or in areas not well served by yellow cabs. While drivers may claim to offer you a cheaper rate than an actual taxi, your chances of actually getting this rate (not to mention getting to your destination safely and quickly) are slim. If you're willing to negotiate and know what you're doing, you might be okay, but you're better off asking an airport staffer for help finding a cab or cabstand. Major airports have taxi information cards for passengers. Always settle on a price before getting into the car.\\n*There are also van and shuttle services in different parts of the city. You will have to ask where it is going and how much it costs. Usually, you will see people lining up and a van will appear and they will board. There are services between Chinatown and Queens (you won\\u2019t have to make any transfers if it goes where you need to go!), and also there are separate services in Brooklyn, and Queens. Many of these services are branded as \\\"Dollar Vans\\\" (actually costing $2.00), and follow major bus routes along major avenues in these boroughs and will drop you off and pick up at any corner along the avenue. Some are legal while most aren't and usually compete with each other for customers and may cut some other van drivers off. This is an accepted practice in these boroughs and at times are faster than MTA buses. The illegal vans may not have insurance so you ride at your own risk. Most drivers of these vans have heavy West Indian accents. Some may seem sketchy but for the most part are people just trying to make a living. They usually are helpful with directions. It is rare that incidents occur with them.\\n*While there are pedicabs in New York, they are generally used more for entertainment than for transit and are priced accordingly. They are rare to nonexistent outside of midtown Manhattan. Fares are usually posted on the vehicle.<!-- Needs updating? -->\\n*One may have heard of the NYPD using undercover taxis in policing. Despite concerns, these undercover taxis ''do not'' engage in taxi business.\\n\\n===By ferry===\\n[[File:Staten_Island_Ferry_(New_York).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Staten Island Ferry]]\\n[[File:NYC_Ferry_Vessel_Curiosity_(H-301).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|New York City Ferry]]\\n*The '''[https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/ferrybus/staten-island-ferry.shtml Staten Island Ferry]''', runs from Battery Park in southern Manhattan to [[Staten Island]]. The ferry carries passengers and bicycles only, runs every 15-20 minutes during rush hours and every 30 minutes at most other times, and is free (so don't be fooled by con artists trying to sell \\\"advance tickets\\\"). Not only does the ferry provide a means of transport, but it offers an amazing view of the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor on its way. Even if you don't want to visit Staten Island, taking this trip is highly recommended. It is very popular with tourists. Ride on the starboard side of the ferry (right side facing the front) from Manhattan and the port side from Staten Island for the best views (to the west). If you want to take good photographs, try to get on the ferry as soon as the gates open and walk briskly to an open window (few windows are open to the air and will populate quickly). The Manhattan-to-Staten Island route passes slightly closer to the Statue of Liberty than the return route. For security reasons, all passengers must exit the ferry upon reaching the terminal. Passengers intending to make an immediate return trip must exit the ferry, walk through the terminal to the waiting area, then board the next departing ferry. While the Staten Island Ferry also used to carry vehicular traffic, it no longer has since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks for security reasons.\\n*'''[https://www.ferry.nyc/ NYC Ferry]''' operates a network of ferries primarily along the East River connecting Manhattan with [[Queens]], [[Brooklyn]], [[The Bronx]] and [[Staten Island]]. There is also one route along the Hudson River connecting Midtown West with Staten Island. These ferries cost the same as a bus or subway at $2.75 per ride (30 day passes are also available), with free transfers between ferries for 90 minutes. Tickets are available for purchase from vending machines or through the NYC Ferry app. There is an extra $1 surcharge to bring a bike. Children under the height of 44 inches ride for free when accompanied by an adult.\\n*'''[https://www.nywaterway.com/ New York Waterway]''', operates ferries that connect the city with the [[New Jersey]] Hudson River Waterfront. One-way fares vary in price depending on the route. For example, the ferries from Hoboken, Lincoln Harbor and Port Imperial to Midtown cost $9.00 each way, with an additional surcharge for carrying a bike. Reduced fares are offered for children and seniors.\\n\\n===By car===\\n{{quote|No one in New York drove; there was too much traffic.|author=Philip J. Fry, ''Futurama''}}\\n[[File:Brooklyn Bridge NY.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Brooklyn Bridge]]\\n\\n{{infobox|Congestion pricing|As if you needed another reason to avoid driving into Manhattan, the MTA has plans to introduce a congestion pricing scheme which will charge motor vehicles for entering Manhattan below 60th Street via license plate scanners. Passenger vehicles would be charged $9 to enter the area between 9AM and 9PM (limited to once per day, so leaving and reentering the zone in the same day would not incur a second charge); larger vehicles would be charged up to $21.60. Taxis would be charged $0.75 per trip into the zone, while other for-hire vehicles such as for Uber will be charged $1.50 per trip. Entering the zone after 9PM would incur a 75% discount; entering the area via the tunnels which already charge tolls (Queens-Midtown, Brooklyn-Battery, Holland, Lincoln) would also see a reduction. The charge does not apply to vehicles that stay on the West Side Highway or FDR Drive. Vehicles without E-ZPass would incur a 50% surcharge. Lawsuits have been filed by various groups which oppose the plan for various reasons and seek a legal order to prevent its implementation.\\n\\nThe plan had been set to take effect on June 30, 2024, but on June 5 New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announced an indefinite delay to the plan, preventing the MTA from implementing it as scheduled. Hochul lifted the pause in November and the MTA voted to reinstate the plan effective January 5, 2025.|}}\\n\\nA word of advice about driving in New York City: '''don't'''. A car is inadvisable \\u2014 street parking is practically nonexistent near crowded areas and tourist attractions, and garage parking rates range from very expensive to plain extortion. Traffic is almost always congested, parking rules are confusing, and many drivers are infamously aggressive. Public transportation options are many, and are quicker, cheaper and more pleasant. That's why many New Yorkers, particularly in Manhattan, don't own cars. If you think of staying in a suburb and commuting to the city by car, better to do as the locals do. Drive to one of the commuter rail stations (see above) or ferry docks. Parking fees at the station, fare, and MetroCard combined are usually much cheaper than parking downtown. Many stations have secure parking areas; however, it\\u2019s wise to investigate beforehand. Some suburban stations limit their parking to local residents, with enforcement by license plate camera and aggressive ticketing of unregistered vehicles. In Staten Island, parking near the ferry terminal and using the ferry will save you money and time.\\n\\nIf you do choose to drive, a smartphone with GPS support and a mapping application with turn-by-turn directions and live traffic conditions support (such as Google Maps, Apple Maps or Waze) is invaluable: New York's eternal cycle of road, bridge and tunnel maintenance, not to mention the daily changes created by accidents, festivals and police activity mean that a published paper map may be catastrophically inaccurate, even if it's been published comparatively recently. Many rental cars may not have a USB power port and even those that do will not provide a charge cable: bringing your own car power adaptor is a must if you're renting.\\n\\nIn Queens, numbers identify not only avenues and streets, but also roads, places, crescents, and lanes, all of which might be near each other. Read the entire street sign. Outer borough highways are confusing and often narrowed to one lane, the potholes could trap an elephant, the signs are sometimes misleading, exits which should appear do not, and signs directing a highway approach drag you through miles of colorful neighborhood (in the wrong direction) before finally letting you onto the highway with a stop sign and a hand's width of merge space.\\n\\nTraffic in New York City roughly follows a hierarchy of precedence, which it is unwise to challenge. Fire engines, ambulances, and police cruisers are given priority, followed by other public service vehicles such as buses, road crews, and sanitation trucks. Beneath them are taxi cabs and delivery trucks. Below ''those'' are other cars. Driving a car with out-of-state license plates (save for perhaps Connecticut or New Jersey) will instantly mark you as an outsider, sometimes resulting in other drivers being more aggressive around you than they would with a local. Suffice it to say, driving in New York is not for the timid or emotionally fragile.\\n\\nHowever, driving can be an exciting adventure, particularly on the parkways, with their numerous twists and turns. (Just watch out for other drivers, as noted above.) Also, since buses don't serve some of the parkways, driving or taking a taxi might be a workable option for those. Nonetheless, try to use bicycles or walk on the pedestrian trails near those parkways, where they exist; trails are less harrowing and you'd probably enjoy the scenery better.\\n\\n====Car rental====\\nThe major car rental agencies have offices at all three airports as well as throughout the city. Smaller agencies are also well represented. Be warned that car rentals in New York are generally more expensive than elsewhere in the United States, especially on weekends, when the locals rent cars to get out of the city. Rentals may require a deposit of up to $500 if you do not have a credit card. New York state law caps rental car collision damage waiver at $9 per day ($15 per day for premium cars), which is quite a bit less than in most other states. At that price, it's not a bad idea to add it to your rental, even if you have another source of coverage. (For more on rental car insurance in New York, check out the New York Attorney General's page on the subject. http://www.ag.ny.gov/consumer-frauds/car-rental-tip-sheet) Unlike most other states in the U.S., New York state law requires rental companies to rent to anyone at least 18 years of age, but there are hefty fees for those under 25.\\n\\nCar-sharing services like Zipcar and Hertz 24/7 are very well represented.\\n\\n====Gas stations====\\nGas stations can be found along main streets in the outer boroughs, but are sparse in Manhattan where only a handful exist around the perimeter of the island and in neighborhoods north of Central Park. Avoid filling your gas tank on highways within city limits\\u2014these charge a lot more compared to neighborhood gas stations.\\n\\n====Points of entry====\\nThere are several points of entry/exit into the city from the New Jersey side: the Lincoln Tunnel (midtown/41st Street), the Holland Tunnel (downtown/Canal Street), and the George Washington Bridge (way uptown/178th Street) \\u2014 all are accessible from the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). I-78 east will also feed directly into the Holland Tunnel (US-1/9 is also a popular route). I-80 east will terminate at an I-95 junction, the north route of which will lead directly to the George Washington Bridge. The bridge is also directly accessible from US-46 east. With all of these options, many commuters choose to listen to 24 hour traffic reports on AM stations 880 (every ten minutes on the 8s) and 1010 (every ten minutes on the 1s, also available on 92.3 FM) to find the least congested route at that time. Weekend traffic delays can easily exceed 60 minutes at some of the tunnels, so plan accordingly!\\n\\nThe Midtown Tunnel under the East River is convenient for Long Island travelers, as it becomes the Long Island Expressway. The Queensborough Bridge (aka The 59th Street Bridge) also crosses the East River into Queens, is toll-free, and lands near the mouth of the Midtown Tunnel but requires some automotive manipulation to get onto a highway. Other routes head north and east out of the Bronx, including Interstates 87 (north to Albany) and 95 (northeast to Boston) and the Henry Hudson Parkway, which is along the Hudson River.\\n\\n====Toll charges====\\nWhen [http://www.panynj.gov/bridges-tunnels/tolls.html entering New York from New Jersey], as well as when driving across the Throgs Neck Bridge, Whitestone Bridge, Verazzano-Narrows Bridge, Triboro Bridge, Midtown Tunnel and Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel [http://web.mta.info/bandt/traffic/btmain.html within New York City], you will incur tolls of up to $15, and associated traffic delays.\\n\\n====Rush hour traffic====\\nTraveling at off-hours makes sense to avoid rush hour traffic, but highways and roads are still generally packed any time of day. The Cross Bronx Expressway, which is part of I-95 and leads to the George Washington Bridge, is almost always choked with traffic. The Long Island Expressway has heavy eastbound traffic between the morning and evening rushes. The Holland and Lincoln Tunnels are 10-minute waits on a good day. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) is notorious, and an accident on the Verazzano Bridge without shoulders can cause a backup all the way through the northern part of Staten Island into New Jersey. It is a good idea to check radio traffic reports, especially before crossing a bridge or tunnel. Three different stations have reports every 10 minutes around the clock: 880 AM (on the 8's), 1010 AM (on the 1's, also available on 92.3 FM), and 1130 AM (on the 5's).\\n\\nDriving cross-town (east-west) in Manhattan during rush hours is especially troublesome because the traffic lights are optimized to move traffic along the north-south roads. Your best bet is to avoid driving in Midtown Manhattan (between the 30s and 50s) whenever possible. If you do drive in Midtown Manhattan crosstown on weekdays, consider using \\\"Thru Streets\\\"\\u2014these streets restrict turns onto major avenues at certain intersections and may reduce delays. They are indicated with purple and white signs at intersections.\\n\\n====Traveling with a commercial vehicle====\\nIf you are traveling with a commercial vehicle (defined as any vehicle designed to transport property with two axles and six tires, or three or more axles) remember that commercial traffic is prohibited on many roadways throughout the city. Commercial traffic is permitted only on roadways designated as Through and Local Truck Routes. [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/commvehicle.shtml Commercial traffic] is prohibited on all multiple-lane roadways designated as \\\"parkways\\\" (such as the Grand Central Parkway, Cross-Island Parkway, or Henry Hudson Parkway) with frequent low bridges. Unfortunately, the majority of fast-moving roadways are designated as parkways in New York City. Commercial traffic is also prohibited on the Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) Drive in Manhattan. Before traveling anywhere in New York City with a commercial vehicle, refer to [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2011_truck_route_map.pdf the New York City Truck Route Map].\\n\\n====Garage parking====\\nParking in garages or outdoor lots is usually very expensive, costing as much as $40 per day in Manhattan, although cheap or free lot parking is available at some times at certain locations. Street parking can be free or much cheaper than garage or lot parking, but can be extremely hard to come by. In Manhattan, self-park (or \\\"park-and-lock\\\") is extremely rare. The overwhelming majority of parking facilities in Manhattan have mandatory valet parking, so you must set aside a few dollars for tips, and anticipate the time it will take for a valet to retrieve your vehicle. Self-park garages in Manhattan near major tourist attractions include the Battery Parking Garage in Lower Manhattan, Manhattan Plaza Parking in Midtown Manhattan, and the public parking garage underneath the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\\n\\nIn the case of parallel parking on the street, \\\"bumping\\\" cars in front of and behind of you to get into and out of a parking spot (known to some as \\\"Braille Parking\\\") is common. If you choose to park on the street, don't be surprised if you find a few new scratches and scrapes on your bumper.\\n\\nAs a general rule, hotels in New York do not supply garage parking. The few that do will charge you handsomely for the privilege.\\n\\nThere are several websites and mobile apps that can help you find and book parking, including: [http://www.parkme.com/new-york-city-parking ParkMe.com], [http://spothero.com/ SpotHero], [http://www.parkwhiz.com/p/new-york-parking/ ParkWhiz.com], [http://nyc.bestparking.com/ BestParking.com], [http://en.parkopedia.com Parkopedia.com], [http://www.iconparking.com/ IconParking.com], and [http://www.parkfast.com/ ParkFast.com].\\n\\n====Street parking: rules and penalties for violation====\\n*Check all parking signs carefully. Parking meters demand constant feeding, and are hungry late into the night in some areas. In some parts of Midtown Manhattan, there are pay-and-display meters which are only in effect from 6PM to midnight on weekdays and all day on weekends. In these areas, parking is prohibited during the workday, except for commercial trucks. It is a good idea to keep a roll of quarters in your car, as not all meters accept credit cards. Parking is permitted at broken or missing meters for the time posted on the signs. Parking is illegal at ALL bus stops and within {{ft|15}} of fire hydrants. Yellow lines on the curb have no legal meaning in NYC, so they cannot be relied upon to tell you if you are parked far enough from a hydrant. However, in most areas the seams in the sidewalk are roughly five feet apart, so leaving at least three \\\"squares\\\" of sidewalk between the hydrant and your bumper is a smart move. Many motorists simply pay garage fees to avoid the anxiety of finding a parking spot and the risks of expensive parking tickets.\\n*New York has \\\"alternate side of the street\\\" [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/alternate-side-parking.shtml parking rules], which may require street parkers to move their cars at different times of the day (such as early morning, or overnight in a few business districts) so that street sweepers can clean the roads. Alternate side rules are suspended on many obscure holidays, while parking meters and other weekday restrictions are only suspended on a few major holidays (not even on all Federal holidays). The current state of parking enforcement can always be found on the \\\"NYC 311\\\" service: dial 311 on any phone, visit [https://www1.nyc.gov/311/ their website] or install the 311 application on your smartphone.\\n*Trying to leave a car parked illegally for very long will often end with a $150 fine, and a vehicle illegally parked in an overcrowded place is very likely to be towed away and face a $300 fine. The New York Police Department operates [http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/towed_vehicles/towed_vehicles.shtml the tow pounds].\\n\\n====Important rules while driving====\\n*The speed limit throughout the city is 25 mph (as of November 7, 2014).\\n*Unlike other places in the United States, '''right turns on red are illegal''', except where otherwise posted. While some entrances to New York City have signs alerting motorists that it is illegal to turn on red, other drivers from out of town may not know this rule.\\n*As in the rest of New York State, talking on a cell-phone (without a hands-free device) or texting while driving is illegal. Even if you do have a hands-free device, minimize your talking and prioritize driving.\\n*There are red light cameras at 100 intersections in New York City. A camera will take a picture if you run a red light and a fine disputable on the web will be issued in 30 days. However, since the camera does not identify who is driving the vehicle, no points will be issued against your drivers' license.\\n*Some bus lanes have video cameras. A camera will take a video if you drive illegally in the bus lane other than to turn right and a fine disputable on the web will be issued in 30 days.\\n*If there is an emergency vehicle trying to get through with its siren blaring, pull over to the side and move forward as necessary. On many one-way streets (avenues in particular), the middle lane is designated as the \\\"FIRE LANE\\\" so that motorists can pull over to either side lane.\\n*Some avenues and many streets have only one-way traffic. Thankfully, one-way streets generally alternate direction, so if your destination is down a one-way street going in the wrong direction, go another block and double-back. A handy mnemonic is \\\"Evens go East,\\\" meaning that, for the most part, streets (in Manhattan) with even numbers will head east, and vice-versa. The best gauge to determine a one way street's direction is to check the direction parked cars face.\\n*Be wary of your surroundings when you park your car. While NYC is a safe city for its size, it's not necessarily safe for your car as well. Make it as unworthy to steal as possible.\\n\\n===By bicycle===\\n[[File:German cycle lecture Mall CP jeh.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Cyclotouring group stopping for a lecture in Central Park]]\\nUsing a [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bicyclists.shtml bicycle in New York City] is common among New Yorkers and tourists alike. Bike paths can be found in every borough of the city, in three forms: bike lanes (road lanes specifically for bicycles), shared lanes (lanes shared between cars and bicycles), and greenways (roads solely designated to bicycles and pedestrians). Greenways are highly recommended for those wishing to go on a recreational journey. The Manhattan Waterfront Greenway circles (almost) the whole of Manhattan, and protected bikeways exist on some major avenues. However, most destinations will require some street biking. A map of bike paths in New York City can be found [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bikemaps.shtml here]. Bike shops give out free maps provided by the City. They show bike routes and shops, and indicate the ones that offer rentals.\\n\\nThe city has a bike share program called '''[http://citibikenyc.com/ CitiBike]'''. The program has over 750 stations in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. A map can be found [https://account.citibikenyc.com/map here]. To access a bike install the app. You can also visit one of the locations and pay for a pass. A single ride costs $3.81 to unlock plus $0.18 per minute. Return your bike to a station (remember to place it securely in a dock\\u2013you will be further fined if the light on the dock does not turn green). CitiBike is good for short trips to a known destination and '''not''' recommended for using a bike for a prolonged period of time.\\n\\nCycling in Manhattan can often be quicker than taking the subway or a taxi, but it isn't for the fainthearted. The borough's tumultuous traffic makes biking difficult. Aggressive cab drivers, jaywalking pedestrians, potholes and debris on the roads create a cycling experience that might just as well have been taken from Dante's ''Inferno''. If you do venture into the concrete jungle on a bike, make sure you wear a helmet and have sufficient experience in urban cycling.\\n\\nCycling in Brooklyn and The Bronx can be more rewarding, or not, depending on the neighborhood. There are few bike paths in Queens; however, the roads are bike-friendly for the most part.\\n\\nCycling is ''not'' recommended in Staten Island. Access is difficult, with the main way to get in being the Staten Island Ferry. There are only a handful of bike paths on the entire island, mostly on the south shore. This is unfortunate, as Staten Island has beautiful displays of nature in some of its parks, most of which are accessible only on foot or by bicycle. If you are looking for scenery, by all means, take your bike with you on the ferry, but do not rely on it for transportation on the street.\\n\\n==See==\\n<!-- ATTENTION ALL CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS PAGE!! New York City is a huge city, so all individual listings should be in the appropriate district articles, and this section should contain a brief overview. -->\\nLike most of the great world cities, New York has an abundance of great attractions\\u2014so many, that it would be impossible to list them all here. What follows is but a sampling of the most high-profile attractions in New York City; more detailed info can be found in the district pages.\\n\\nA general word of advice on sightseeing in New York: Tourists often spend their entire vacation in New York standing in line (or as New Yorkers say, \\\"on line\\\"). This is often unnecessary; there are usually alternatives. For example, one can choose to avoid the Empire State Building during the day (it is open, and much quieter, late, until 2AM), skip the Statue of Liberty in favor of the Staten Island Ferry, and stay away from the Guggenheim on Monday (it is one of the only museums open that day). Also, there is no reason to stand in line for a Broadway show if you already have a ticket with an assigned seat. If you prefer, get a drink nearby and come back closer to curtain time, when you can walk right in. The lines for bus tours can be absurd because tourists all seem to have exactly the same itinerary, which is get on a bus in the morning in Times Square, get off for the Statue of Liberty, and finish on the East Side in the afternoon. Why not go downtown in the morning, and save Midtown for the afternoon? You will thank yourself for avoiding the crowds. Also, understand that buses are the slowest way to go crosstown in Midtown Manhattan during peak hours, and taxis are not much better. You are often better off on foot. Additionally, New York rush hour (especially in Manhattan) puts much of the city in gridlock: all subway lines and roads will be much busier from 4:30PM to 6:30PM.\\n\\n===Passes===\\nA number of multi-attraction schemes give reduced prices and line-skipping privileges.\\n\\n* {{see\\n| name=GoCity Pass | alt= | url=https://gocity.com/new-york/en-us | email=\\n| address= | lat=NA | long=NA | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2022-09-06\\n| content=2 passes are available from GoCity.

Detail is gradually being moved from this page to the district pages.''\\n\\n===Landmarks===\\n[[Image:Statueofliberty nps.jpg|thumb|Statue of Liberty]]\\nNaturally, [[Manhattan]] possesses the lion's share of the landmarks that have saturated American popular culture. Starting in the [[Manhattan/Financial District|Financial District]], perhaps the most famous of these landmarks is easy to spot - the '''[http://www.nps.gov/stli/ Statue of Liberty]''', a symbol of the nation standing atop a small island in the harbor, and perhaps also the most difficult attraction to access in terms of crowds and the long lines to see it. Nearby '''Ellis Island''' preserves the site where millions of immigrants completed their journey to America. Within the Financial District itself, '''Wall Street''' acts as the heart of big business being the home of the '''New York Stock Exchange''', although the narrow street also holds some historical attractions, namely '''Federal Hall''', where George Washington was inaugurated as the first president of the United States. Furthermore, there is a large statue of a bull that tourists often take pictures with. Nearby, the National September 11 Memorial at the '''World Trade Center Site''' commemorates the victims of that fateful day. Connecting the Financial District to [[Brooklyn/Downtown|Downtown Brooklyn]], the '''Brooklyn Bridge''' offers fantastic views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn skylines.\\n\\nMoving north to [[Manhattan/Midtown|Midtown]], Manhattan's other major business district, you'll find some of New York's most famous landmarks. The '''Empire State Building''' looms over Midtown, with the nearby '''Chrysler Building''' also dominating the landscape. Nearby is the headquarters of '''United Nations''' overlooking the East River and '''Grand Central Terminal''', one of the busiest train stations in the world. Also nearby is the main branch of the '''New York Public Library''', a beautiful building famous for its magnificent reading rooms and the lion statues outside the front door; and '''Rockefeller Plaza''', home to NBC Studios, Radio City Music Hall, and (during the winter) the famous Christmas Tree and Skating Rink.\\n\\nStill in the Midtown area but just to the west, in the [[Manhattan/Theater District|Theater District]], is the tourist center of New York: '''Times Square''', filled with bright, flashing video screens and LED signs running 24 hours a day. Just to the north is '''[[Manhattan/Central Park|Central Park]]''', with its lawns, trees and lakes popular for recreation and concerts.\\n\\n===Museums and galleries===\\n<!-- ATTENTION ALL CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS PAGE!! New York City is a huge city, so all individual listings should be in the appropriate district articles, and this section should contain a brief overview. -->\\nNew York has some of the finest museums in the world, many of which are priced accordingly. In addition to the major museums, hundreds of small galleries are spread throughout the city, notably in neighborhoods like Chelsea and Williamsburg. Many galleries and museums in New York close on Mondays, so be sure to check hours before visiting. The following is just a list of highlights; see district pages for more listings.\\n\\n====Arts and culture====\\nNew York City is home to some of the finest art museums in the country, and in [[Manhattan]], you'll find the grandest of them all. The '''Metropolitan Museum of Art''' in [[Manhattan/Central Park|Central Park]] has vast holdings that represent a series of collections, each of which ranks in its category among the finest in the world. Within this single building you'll find perhaps the world's finest collection of American artwork, period rooms, thousands of European paintings including Rembrandts and Vermeers, the greatest collection of Egyptian art outside Cairo, one of the world's finest Islamic art collections, Asian art, European sculpture, medieval and Renaissance art, and antiquities from around the ancient world. As if all that wasn't enough, the Metropolitan also operates '''The Cloisters''' in Fort Tryon Park in [[Manhattan/Harlem and Upper Manhattan|Upper Manhattan]], which houses a collection of medieval art and incorporates elements from five medieval French cloisters and other monastic sites in southern France in its renowned gardens.\\n\\nNear the Metropolitan, in the [[Manhattan/Upper East Side|Upper East Side]], is the '''Guggenheim Museum'''. Although more famed for its architecture than the collection it hosts, the spiraling galleries are ideal for exhibiting art works. The nearby '''Frick Collection''' houses a smaller though well-regarded collection of paintings by the old masters. In [[Manhattan/Midtown|Midtown]], the '''Museum of Modern Art''' (MoMA) holds the most comprehensive collection of modern art in the world, and is so large as to require multiple visits to see all of the works on display, which include Van Gogh's Starry Night and Picasso's Les Demoiselles d\\u2019Avignon, as well as an extensive industrial design collection. Midtown is also home to the '''Paley Center for Media''', a museum dedicated to television and radio, including a massive database of old shows. The '''Whitney Museum of American Art''', with a collection of contemporary American art, can be found in the Meatpacking District.\\n\\nIn [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Brooklyn/Prospect Park|Prospect Park]], the '''Brooklyn Museum of Art''' is the city's second largest art museum with excellent collections of Egyptian art, Assyrian reliefs, 19th-century American art, and art from Africa and Oceania, among other things. [[Queens/Long Island City|Long Island City]] in [[Queens]] is home to a number of art museums, including the '''PS1 Contemporary Art Center''', an affiliate of the Museum of Modern Art, and the '''Museum of the Moving Image''', which showcases movies and the televisual arts.\\n\\n====Science and technology====\\n[[Image:Hayden planetarium at night.jpg|thumb|300px|The night is illuminated by the Rose Center for Earth and Space, home of the astronomy wing at the American Museum of Natural History.]]\\nIn New York City, no museum holds a sway over children like the '''American Museum of Natural History''' in Manhattan's [[Manhattan/Upper West Side|Upper West Side]]. Containing the Hayden Planetarium, incredible astronomy exhibits, animal dioramas, many rare and beautiful gems and mineral specimens, anthropology halls, and one of the largest collections of dinosaur skeletons in the world, this place offers plenty of stunning sights.\\n\\nNear Times Square in the [[Manhattan/Theater District|Theater District]], the '''Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum''' takes up a pier on the Hudson River, with the aircraft carrier ''Intrepid'' docked here and holding some incredible air and space craft, including a former British Airways Concorde.\\n\\nOver in the [[Queens/Flushing-Northeast|Flushing]] district of Queens, on the grounds of the former World's Fair, is the '''New York Hall of Science''', which incorporates the Great Hall of the fair and now full of hands-on exhibits for kids to enjoy.\\n\\nAnother standout museum is the '''New York Transit Museum''' in an abandoned subway station in [[Brooklyn/Downtown|Downtown Brooklyn]]. The old subway cars are a real treat and the museum is ''a must'' if you're in New York with kids (and well-worth it even if you're not).\\n\\nUntil the mid-20th century, New York was a predominantly industrial city. While most factories have been torn down, some neighborhoods, such as SoHo and the Meatpacking District, remain as a heritage of manufacturing. See [[American Industry Tour#Day 4: Metropolitan New York|the American Industry Tour]].\\n\\n===Neighborhoods===\\nLike all great cities, New York is made up of distinct neighborhoods, each of which has its own flavor. Many of the neighborhoods are popular with visitors, and all are best experienced on foot. See individual borough pages ([[Manhattan]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], [[Bronx]], and [[Staten Island]]) for a comprehensive listing of neighborhoods.\\n\\n===Parks===\\n<!-- ATTENTION ALL CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS PAGE!! New York City is a huge city, so all individual listings should be in the appropriate district articles, and this section should contain a brief overview. -->\\n\\nThough the image many people have of New York is endless skyscrapers and packed sidewalks, the city also boasts numerous lovely parks, ranging from small squares to the 850-acre '''Central Park'''. There are worthwhile parks in every borough, more than enough to keep any visitor busy. These include '''Fort Tryon Park''' in Upper Manhattan, which boasts grand views of the New Jersey Palisades, the grand '''Pelham Bay Park''' in The Bronx, the popular '''Prospect Park''' in Brooklyn, the famous '''Flushing Meadows Park''' in Corona, Queens, site of the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament, and the wondrous '''Greenbelt''' in Staten Island, a collection of beautiful parks and protected forests unlike any other park in the city. New York City is also home to portions of the '''[[Gateway National Recreation Area]]'''. Almost any park is a great spot to rest, read, or just relax and watch the people streaming past. To find out more about New York City parks, go to the [http://www.nycgovparks.org/ New York City Department of Parks & Recreation website] and the guide pages for each borough. Except for special events, all NYC parks are closed 1AM\\u20136AM. The exception to this rule is parks affiliated with schools, which are closed for the entire time the sun is down.\\n\\n==Do==\\n\\n===Entertainment===\\n====Theater and performing arts====\\nNew York boasts an enormous number and variety of theatrical performances. Most of these are concentrated in Manhattan, particularly the [[Manhattan/Theater District|Theater District]] around Times Square, where you'll find the major musicals and big-name dramatic works of Broadway. These are the most popular with visitors, with tickets for some shows running to $130 a seat, though discounters make cheaper seats available. And if you're in town in early June (and willing to spend a lot of money), it's possible to purchase tickets to the Tony Awards, Broadway's biggest award ceremony and the culmination of the theatrical season in the city. However, you can also find \\\"Off-Broadway\\\" shows (and even the dirt cheap and very small \\\"Off-Off-Broadway\\\" shows) throughout Manhattan that play to smaller audiences and are far less expensive. [http://www.playbill.com Playbill.com] is a good resource for current and upcoming Broadway and Off-Broadway info and listings. See the [[Manhattan#Performing arts|Manhattan]] page for more detailed info on theater offerings.\\n\\nSome of New York's (and the world's) most high profile music and dance halls include the '''Brooklyn Academy of Music''' in [[Brooklyn/Downtown|Downtown Brooklyn]], '''Carnegie Hall''' \\u2014 the premier venue for classical music in the United States \\u2014 in Manhattan's Theater District, '''Radio City Music Hall''' \\u2014 home of the Rockettes \\u2014 in [[Manhattan/Midtown|Midtown]], and '''Lincoln Center''' in the [[Manhattan/Upper West Side|Upper West Side]], home to the prestigious Chamber Music Society, the Metropolitan Opera (\\\"the Met\\\"), the New York City Ballet, and the New York Philharmonic. There are also numerous small companies putting on more idiosyncratic shows every night of the week.\\n\\n====Film and television====\\nNew York is one of the world's greatest film cities, home to a huge number of theaters playing independent and repertory programs. Many major US studio releases open earlier in New York than elsewhere (especially in the autumn) and can be found at the major cineplexes (AMC, United Artists, etc.) around the city. As with everything else in New York, movies are quite popular, and even relatively obscure films at unappealing times of the day can still be sold out. It's best to get tickets in advance whenever possible. As many films premiere in New York, you can often catch a moderated discussion with the director or cast after the show. Sometimes even repertory films will have post-screening discussions or parties. Check listings for details.\\n\\nIn addition to the many commercial multiplexes throughout the city, some of the more intriguing New York film options include the several theaters in [[Manhattan/Greenwich Village|Greenwich Village]] and the [[Manhattan/East Village|East Village]] which play independent and foreign releases, many of which are screened only in New York. The '''Film Society at Lincoln Center''' in the [[Manhattan/Upper West Side|Upper West Side]] puts on a terrific repertory program and shows a wide variety of experimental and foreign films, and also hosts the prestigious New York Film Festival in October. Another major film festival is the '''[[Manhattan/TriBeCa|Tribeca]] Film Festival''', held each May and a prominent event in New York's film calendar. The '''Museum of the Moving Image''' in [[Queens/Long Island City|Long Island City]] in Queens puts on a terrific screening program, with films showing continuously throughout the day, while '''MoMa''' in [[Manhattan/Midtown|Midtown Manhattan]] puts on a terrific repertory program (and compared to other New York movie theaters, tickets to films at MoMA are a steal).\\n\\nVirtually every major national television network has studios in Manhattan, particularly the Midtown area, and many well-known programs are open to viewers. '''Rockefeller Center''' is home to NBC Studios and its flagship shows, including ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''Today'', and is open for tours. '''Lincoln Square''' boasts programming produced for ABC, such as ''The View'' and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'', at the network's West 66th Street facility. More examples of popular programs you can see in person can be found on the [[Manhattan#Television|Manhattan]] page.\\n\\n====Parades====\\nNew York City hosts many parades, street festivals and outdoor pageants. The following are the most famous:\\n\\n*'''New York's Village Halloween Parade'''. Each Halloween (October 31) at 7PM. This parade and street pageant attracts 2 million spectators and 50,000 costumed participants along Sixth Avenue between Spring Street and 21st Street. Anyone in a costume is welcome to march; those wishing to should show up between 6PM-9PM at Spring Street and 6th Avenue.\\n*'''Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade'''. The morning of each Thanksgiving on Central Park West, this parade attracts many spectators and is broadcast on nationwide television.\\n*'''St. Patrick's Day Parade'''. The largest St. Paddy's parade in the world! Route is up 5th Ave from 44th Street to 86th Street and lasts from 11AM to about 2:30. Celebrations in pubs citywide happen the rest of the day and night until the green beer runs out.\\n*''' Labor Day (aka West Indian Day Parade or New York Caribbean Carnival)'''.\\n[[File:West Indian Day Parade 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|West Indian Day Parade-goers in front of the Brooklyn Museum on Eastern Parkway]]\\nThe Labor Day Carnival, or West Indian Carnival, is an annual celebration held in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Its main event is the West Indian-American Day Parade, which attracts between one and three million spectators, who watch the parade on its route along Eastern Parkway.\\n\\n===Sports===\\nA number of professional and collegiate teams play in the New York metropolitan area.\\n[[File:USA - NY, Manhattan - Yankee Stadium - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Yankee Stadium, an architectural replica of the \\\"House that Ruth Built\\\"]]\\n*The '''New York Yankees''' play [[Baseball in the United States|Major League Baseball]] at '''Yankee Stadium''' in the Bronx (East 161st Street and River Avenue. Subway: 4, B, D to 161st Street-Yankee Stadium). One of the most storied and lucrative sports franchises in the world, the Yankees have won 27 World Series championships in all, and have had many of the greatest players in baseball history play for the team including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. The original Yankee Stadium (known as \\\"The House That Ruth Built\\\" in reference to baseball legend Babe Ruth), was replaced by the current, more modern incarnation of the ballpark in 2009. The former site of the stadium before its relocation across the road is now a park.\\n[[File:View of Citi Field From the Top of the Arthur Ashe Stadium (9610310613) (2).jpg|thumb|Citi Field, known for its fan atmosphere and concessions]]\\n*'''Citi Field''' in Flushing Meadows (126th Street and Roosevelt Avenue. Subway: 7 to Mets-Willets Point) is home to the '''New York Mets''', who play in the National League of Major League Baseball unlike the Yankees (who play in the American League). The history of the National League in New York dates back to the 1800s with two teams: the New York Giants (not to be confused with the NFL's New York Giants), and Brooklyn Dodgers. When both of these teams moved to California in 1958, New York was left without the National League until 1962, when the Mets were born. The Mets have won two World Series titles since their inception. Notably, Citi Field is known for the Home Run Apple that rises when the Mets score a home run. This feature dates back to 1980, when the apple was first installed at Citi Field's predecessor venue, Shea Stadium. Citi Field first opened in 2009, around the same time as the new Yankee Stadium's first game.\\n*In addition to its many concerts and the annual Westminster Dog Show, '''Madison Square Garden''' hosts the '''New York Knicks''' of the NBA and '''New York Rangers''' of the NHL, plus annual postseason college basketball for the Big East Conference. It had been home to the New York Liberty of the WNBA through the 2017 season, but that team now shares Barclays Center with the Brooklyn Nets. (Pennsylvania Plaza. Subway: 1, 2, 3, A, C, E to 34th Street-Penn Station). Madison Square Garden advertises itself as \\\"The World's Most Famous Arena\\\", and it's easy to see why.\\n*[[File:Madison Square Garden (MSG) - Full (48124330357).jpg|thumb|Madison Square Garden, the self-proclaimed \\\"World's Most Famous Arena\\\"]]Long based in New Jersey, the '''Brooklyn Nets''' basketball team moved to '''Barclays Center''' in Brooklyn (Vanderbilt Yards. Subway: 2, 3, 4, 5, B, D, N, Q, R to Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center) when that arena opened in 2012. The aforementioned '''New York Liberty''', now owned by the Nets' owner, moved to Barclays Center in 2021 (delayed from 2020 by COVID-19).\\n* Other NHL teams are the '''New York Islanders''' and '''New Jersey Devils'''. The Islanders now play at '''UBS Arena''' in Elmont, just outside Queens and a little less than 20 miles east of Midtown (LIRR: Elmont), which opened in November 2021. Notably, the arena is next to the Belmont Park horse racing track. The Devils skate at the '''Prudential Center''' in Newark, New Jersey, 12 miles west of midtown.\\n*Two National Football League teams play at '''MetLife Stadium''' in East Rutherford, New Jersey, 10 miles northwest of midtown Manhattan. The '''New York Giants''' in the National Football Conference have won four Super Bowls, while the '''New York Jets''' of the American Football Conference have won one.\\n* {{do\\n| name=Brooklyn Cyclones | alt= | url=http://www.brooklyncyclones.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Play Minor League Baseball (South Atlantic League- North Division) at '''Maimonides Park''' (Subway: D, F, Fd, N, Q at Coney Island\\u2013Stilwell Avenue).

The '''Westchester Knicks''' play at the '''Westchester County Center''' in [[White Plains]], while the '''Long Island Nets''' play at the '''Nassau Coliseum''', the former home of the Islanders in Uniondale (a bit more than 25 miles east of Midtown).\\n* There are four top-level soccer franchises, two men's and two women's, in the Tri-State area. The '''New York Red Bulls''' (Major League Soccer) play home matches at '''Sports Illustrated Stadium''' (recently renamed from Red Bull Arena) in Harrison, New Jersey, 11 miles from midtown Manhattan. '''New York City FC''' (partially owned by the Yankees) became the Tri-State's second MLS team in 2015; they are playing in Yankee Stadium until they can build a new stadium of their own. '''NJ/NY Gotham FC''', a member of the National Women's Soccer League, has shared SI Stadium with the Red Bulls since 2020.

It is adjacent to and affiliated with [https://barnard.edu/ '''Barnard College'''], a top women's school. '''[http://www.nyu.edu/ New York University]''' ('''NYU''') is also highly selective. Another notable university is '''[http://www.rockefeller.edu/ Rockefeller University]''', a graduate-only school at which several significant biomedical discoveries were made. And the city also has its very own system of public colleges, '''City University of New York''', with every borough represented among its numerous branches.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n<!-- ATTENTION ALL CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS PAGE!! New York City is a huge city, so all individual listings should be in the appropriate district articles, and this section should contain a brief overview. -->\\nIt is not a lie: New York City is one of the world's most expensive cities. One survey revealed that the city is the most expensive city in the world for expatriate workers. \\n\\nThat being said, there are ways to limit the damage; food is available from many halal food trucks for $7-10, which will get you rice with meat, vegetables and a soft drink, and you can still find inexpensive pizza slices at many of the hole-in-the-wall pizzerias throughout the city. Supermarkets and convenience stores generally also sell basic items at reasonable prices (by Western standards). New York's public bathroom infrastructure is lacking, so buying an item at a facility with a bathroom is generally advisable if you are far from your accommodation.\\n\\nNew York is the fashion capital of the United States, and is a major shopping destination for people around the world. The city boasts an unmatched range of department stores, boutiques, and specialty shops. Some neighborhoods boast more shopping options than most other American cities and have become famous as consumer destinations. Anything you could possibly want to buy can be found in New York, including clothing, cameras, computers and accessories, music, musical instruments, electronic equipment, art supplies, sporting goods, and all kinds of foodstuffs and kitchen appliances. See the '''borough pages''' and '''district sub-pages''' for listings of some of the more important stores and major business districts, of which there are several. New York state has a sales tax exemption on all clothing items that cost less than $100.\\n\\nThe popular place to begin is Manhattan, most notably Fifth Avenue in [[Manhattan/Midtown|Midtown Manhattan]], where the iconic flagship stores of many major department stores such as [http://www.saksfifthavenue.com Saks Fifth Avenue] and [http://www.bergdorfgoodman.com/ Bergdorf Goodman] are located. Other notable department stores in Manhattan include the world-famous [http://l.macys.com/new-york-ny Macy's] at Herald Square, [https://www.bloomingdales.com/ Bloomingdale's] on 59th Street between 3rd and Lexington Avenues, and [https://www.nordstrom.com/ Nordstrom] on Broadway at 57th Street. Of course, for dirt-cheap knockoffs, the various Chinatowns in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn respectively are the place to go.\\n\\nNew York City is not known for budget shopping, but during major sales, such as the Black Friday sale after Thanksgiving, prices of some out-of-season items have been known to be slashed by as much as 50%, meaning that it is possible to find good deals for genuine luxury brand-name items if you are there at the right time. Savvy New Yorkers shop after Christmas and especially after New Year's.\\n\\n===Buying art===\\nAnyone can freely create, display, and sell art, including paintings, prints, photographs, sculptures, DVDs, and CDs, based on freedom of speech rights. Thousands of artists earn their livings on New York's streets and parks. Common places to find street artists selling their work are SoHo, the Financial District and near the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\\n\\n===Outlets===\\nNew York City has a number of retail outlet locations, offering substantial discounts and the opportunity to purchase ends-of-line and factory seconds.\\n\\n===Convenience stores, pharmacies, and supermarkets===\\nBasic food, drinks, snacks, medicine, and toiletries can be found at decent prices at the ubiquitous '''[http://www.duanereade.com/ Duane Reade]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}''' (owned by Walgreens), '''CVS''', and '''Rite Aid''' stores. For a more authentically New York experience, stop by one of the thousands of bodegas/delis/groceries. Although some of these stores have a somewhat ramshackle appearance, they are reliable though often not the cheapest places to purchase groceries, water, flowers, coffee, and cooked food, typically 24/7.\\n\\nThere are several local and regional chains of supermarkets represented all over the city, including '''Associated''', '''C-Town''', '''D'Agostino's''', '''Foodtown''', '''Gristedes''' and '''Key Food''', and '''Fairway''' and '''West Side Market''' have a few locations. There are also chains such as '''Hong Kong Supermarket''' and '''H-Mart''', which cater primarily to Chinese and Korean customers, respectively. National chains selling food include '''Trader Joe's''', '''Whole Foods Market''', '''Costco''' (membership required; mostly in bulk) and '''Target'''.\\n\\n===Shopping in airports===\\nMost shops in New York-area airports are chain outlets, the same as can be found in most large airports in the world, so it's pretty difficult to feel the spirit of the fashion capital if you only have 2 hours waiting for a connecting flight. At JFK, JetBlue Airways' new Terminal 5 is populated with modern, cutting-edge restaurants and shops, but terminals 4 and 8 are also relatively good places for retail and duty-free shopping.\\n\\n===Street vendors===\\nIn New York City it is common for street vendors to set up tables on the sidewalk, close to the curb, and sell items. They are required to obtain a permit to perform this activity, but it is legal. Purchasing from these vendors is generally legitimate, although buying brand name goods from them (particularly expensive clothing and movies) is generally ill-advised unless you want cheap imitation products. It is considered safe to buy less expensive goods from these vendors, but most will not accept payment by credit card, so you will have to bring cash. Be particularly wary of any street vendor that does not sell from a table (especially vendors who approach you with their merchandise in a briefcase), as these goods are almost certainly cheap imitation products.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n<!-- ATTENTION ALL CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS PAGE!! New York City is a huge city, so all individual listings should be in the appropriate district articles, and this section should contain a brief overview. -->\\nNew York has, as you might expect of the Big Apple, all the eating options covered and you can find almost every type of food available and every cuisine of the world represented. There are literally tens of thousands of restaurants, ranging from dingy cheap pizza-by-the-slice joints to $500-a-plate ''prix fixe'' sushi. Thousands of delis, bodegas, and grocery stores dot every corner of the city and do it yourself meals are easy and cheap to find. [[Street food]] comes in various tastes, ranging from the ubiquitous New York hot dog vendors to the many Middle Eastern carts at street corners in Midtown. [[Fast food in North America| Fast food]] is as plentiful and as diverse as you can imagine. Fruit stalls appear at many intersections from spring to fall with ready-to-eat strawberries, bananas, apples, etc. available at very low cost. Vegetarian and vegan options abound throughout the city.\\n\\n===Don't leave without trying===\\n====New York pizza====\\n[[File:NewYorkSlice.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A slice of the real deal]]\\nA peculiarly New York thing, a true New York pizza is a plain cheese pizza with a very thin crust (sometimes chewy, sometimes crisp), and an artery-hardening sheen of grease on top. From just about any pizzeria, you can get a whole pie with a variety of toppings available, or a \\\"dollar slice\\\" if you just want a piece of plain cheese pizza. The \\\"dollar slice\\\" cost $1 at the start of the 21st century, but prices have risen, and it may cost anywhere between $1.50 and $4 before sales tax, depending on the place and any toppings you want. Just fold in half lengthwise, grab a lot of napkins, and eat \\u2013 the quintessential meal on the go in New York. Dollar-slice places can be found all over the city, and include the many different variations of \\\"Ray's Pizza\\\", all of which claim to be the original thing. However, perhaps the most respected of the corner joints is the wildly popular '''Joe's''' in [[Manhattan/Greenwich Village|Greenwich Village]].\\n\\nBut while pizza in New York is generally considered a fast food, the most respected pizzerias in the city are those that act like sit-down restaurants, and some of them serve whole pies only, no slices. Except for DiFara's, all the following pizzerias use a classic New York style of coal-fired, rather than gas-fired ovens, which allows them to bake their pizza for a very short time at very high temperatures, producing a unique style of crispy, slightly charred crust that makes their output quite different from the average corner slice shop. Every New Yorker has their own personal favorite, but several routinely make it to the top of the list. '''Lombardi's''' in [[Manhattan/Chinatown|Little Italy]] is regarded as the oldest pizzeria in town and continues to draw in big crowds of tourists, but '''Patsy's''' in [[Manhattan/Harlem and Upper Manhattan|East Harlem]] has long been regarded by connoisseurs as serving perhaps the purest example of plain New York-style coal-oven pizza (don't order any toppings, though). [[Manhattan/Greenwich Village|Greenwich Village]] is the center of pizza on Manhattan, home to not only Joe's but also the classic '''John's''' and the popular '''Arturo's'''. In Brooklyn, '''Grimaldi's''' in [[Brooklyn/Downtown|DUMBO]] is hugely popular with lines that go down the street, while '''Totonno's''' on [[Brooklyn/Coney Island and Brighton Beach|Coney Island]] and '''Di Fara's''' in [[Brooklyn/Bedford-Stuyvesant and Flatbush|Midwood]] remain mainstays with the locals. There are also excellent brick-oven establishments serving Neapolitan or other styles of pizza that are not classic New York but well worth having.\\n\\n====New York hot dog====\\nNothing represents New York [[street food]] like the almighty hot dog. Affectionately called \\\"dirty water dogs\\\" by the locals, a New York hot dog is typically all-beef, served in a plain bun, and topped with mustard, ketchup, relish, or any combination of the three. You can get one from pushcarts on seemingly every street corner and park in the city. Just wrap the dog in a paper napkin and walk along the sidewalk trying not to let the toppings slip and slide all over your hands. And of course, both ballparks make sure to keep their fans' hot dog needs satisfied.\\n\\nHowever, there are a few places that go a step beyond the typical dirty water dog, with better cooked dogs and a much greater variety of toppings available. Many hot dog enthusiasts make the pilgrimage to the original hot dog stand, '''Nathan's''' on [[Brooklyn/Coney Island and Brighton Beach|Coney Island]], although locals generally view it as a tourist trap. In Manhattan, '''Papaya King''' (on the [[Manhattan/Upper East Side|Upper East Side]]) and '''Gray's Papaya''' (on the [[Manhattan/Upper West Side|Upper West Side]]) are favorites, so-named because they also serve tropical drinks with their frankfurters. In addition to their sandwiches, '''Katz's''' on the [[Manhattan/Lower East Side|Lower East Side]] is also reputed for an excellent deli dog. In the [[Manhattan/East Village|East Village]], '''Crif Dogs''' draws people in for their deep-fried, beef-and-pork (and often bacon-wrapped!) dogs. '''Dominick's''' food truck commands a fiercely loyal crowd, who flock to a quiet side of [[Queens/Forest Park|Queens]] to get a taste. People looking for a good bratwurst should try the '''Hallo Berlin''' cart on 54th and Fifth in [[Manhattan/Midtown|Midtown]], while Chicago purists should head to the '''Shake Shack''' in [[Manhattan/Gramercy Flatiron|Madison Square Park]].\\n\\n====New York bagel====\\nThere is no bagel like the New York bagel anywhere else in the world. Bagels are a doughnut-shaped round of boiled dough that is then baked until it has a distinctive, chewy, sweet interior and a leathery outer crust. They arrived from the Old World with Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe and have become utterly New York in character. You can get bagels anywhere in the city, but for the best bagels you may have to trek away from the main tourist sites. The key point, though, is get them when they are hot (and that does not mean reheated in the microwave). Some places actively discourage toasting; try them fresh out of the oven. Good bagel shops will offer a variety of cream cheese spreads and sandwich stuffings, like lox, salmon, tofu spreads, onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Many bagel shops are extremely generous with their cream cheese; locals will order \\\"just a schmear\\\" to get a more reasonable amount.\\n\\nOn Manhattan, many people swear by '''Ess'a Bagel''' in [[Manhattan/Midtown East|Midtown]], with their giant bagels and huge variety of toppings, although bagel purists respect '''Murray's''' in [[Manhattan/Greenwich Village|Greenwich Village]] and [[Manhattan/Chelsea|Chelsea]] for their refusal to allow toasting. Other places in Manhattan which command fiercely loyal followings are '''Brooklyn Bagel''', also in Chelsea, and '''Absolute Bagels''' on the [[Manhattan/Upper West Side|Upper West Side]]. In Brooklyn, '''Bagel Hole''' in [[Brooklyn/Prospect Park|Park Slope]] is a no-frills place with smaller bagels, and is often ranked as one of the top bagels in the city, while over in a quiet section of [[Queens/Flushing-Northeast|Queens]], '''Bagel Oasis''' is regularly considered among the very best.\\n\\n====New York pastrami sandwich====\\n[[File:Katz's Deli - Lunch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Corned beef piled high on rye: a Reuben at Katz's]]\\nAnother delicacy brought over by Jewish immigrants, pastrami sandwiches are another specialty of New York City. A \\\"Reuben\\\", a grilled sandwich piled high with corned beef, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing and sauerkraut between two slices of rye bread, is always a good choice, though it is not kosher as it violates the Jewish prohibition on mixing meat and dairy. A good deli sandwich doesn't come cheap: be prepared to spend upwards of $20 for a good sandwich, due to the fact that these meats are prepared using natural methods now outmoded by artificial flavorings and mass production. Many delis also serve other Jewish specialties, such as matzo ball soup.\\n\\nIf you want pastrami, your best bet is '''Katz's Delicatessen''', an institution on the [[Manhattan/Lower East Side|Lower East Side]] that's been serving up excellent sandwiches for over a century. '''2nd Ave Deli''' in [[Manhattan/Gramercy Flatiron|Murray Hill]] is a famous kosher deli that's a real throwback to the Jewish delis of old. And if you find yourself over in [[Brooklyn/East|East Brooklyn]], '''Mill Basin Deli''' is known for some of the best pastrami in Brooklyn.\\n\\n====New York desserts====\\nAnother New York claim to fame is the '''New York cheesecake''', which relies upon heavy cream, cream cheese, eggs and egg yolks to add a richness and a smooth consistency. It was made famous by '''Junior's''', which still commands a loyal crowd with two locations in Midtown, although the original is in [[Brooklyn/Downtown|Downtown Brooklyn]]. Other favorites are '''Eileen's''' in [[Manhattan/Chinatown|NoLiTa]], '''Lady M''' and '''Two Little Red Hens''' in the [[Manhattan/Upper East Side|Upper East Side]] and '''S&S''' in the [[Bronx]] (whose cheesecake is also sold at Zabar's on the [[Manhattan/Upper West Side|Upper West Side]]).\\n\\nAnother dessert of New York origin is the '''egg cream''', also often referred to as a \\\"chocolate egg cream\\\", a blend of chocolate syrup, milk, and seltzer water (note the curious absence of either egg or cream). Though not often on the menu at many diners, many will still prepare one for you if you ask for one. You can also find them in surprising places, like the tiny Ray's Candy Store in the [[Manhattan/East Village|East Village]].\\n\\n===Restaurants===\\nMaybe it's the size of New Yorkers' tiny kitchens, or perhaps it's the enormous melting-pot immigrant populations, but either way, this city excels at every kind of restaurant. There are fancy famous-chef restaurants, all ethnic cuisines and fusion/updates of ethnic cuisines (second-generation immigrants tweaking their family tradition), plus all the fashionable spots, casual bistros, lounges for drinking and noshing and more.\\n\\nIt's only a slight exaggeration to say that virtually every type of cuisine is available in New York. And in some neighborhoods you'll find many national and regional styles represented. However, certain neighborhoods, particularly those in [[Queens]], really shine in terms of the sheer variety available to visitors. While Manhattan's high rents often result in expensive restaurants and sometimes watered-down, unnaturally sweetened food, Queens' vast array of cuisines are often served primarily to patrons from the countries where they originated. Not that Manhattan is completely bereft by any stretch, however: a wide variety of Chinese options can be found in [[Manhattan/Chinatown|Chinatown]] and [[Manhattan/East Village|the East Village]], there's the small [[Manhattan/Midtown#Eat|Koreatown]] with some very good (but not necessarily cheap) restaurants, [[Manhattan/Harlem and Upper Manhattan|Washington Heights]] is the center for Dominican food, [[Manhattan/East Village|the East Village]] is full of Japanese eateries of various types, and part of [[Manhattan/Gramercy Flatiron|Murray Hill]] is known as \\\"Curry Hill\\\" for its proliferation of Indian restaurants. But in Queens, [[Queens/Flushing-Northeast|Flushing]] offers a vast and diverse array of Chinese (including Northeastern, Sichuan, Hunanese, Shanghainese, etc.), Korean, and Indian eateries; [[Queens/Jackson Heights|Jackson Heights]] includes a prominent Indian section among a vast Latin American neighborhood whose eateries span the American continents from Chilean to Mexican and almost everything in between; nearby Elmhurst features various Southeast Asian (for example Vietnamese and Thai, with a couple of Indonesian and Malaysian restaurants thrown in) and Chinese cuisines; [[Queens/Long Island City|Long Island City]] has locally well-known halal restaurants among a very diverse set of good establishments; nearby Astoria is best known for its Mediterranean food; and [[Queens/Forest Park|Rego Park]] has Uzbek dining halls. In Brooklyn, [[Brooklyn/Coney Island and Brighton Beach|Brighton Beach]] is noted for its Russian eateries, while [[Brooklyn/Southwest Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] is home to a third Chinatown as well as plenty of Malaysian and Vietnamese options. Italian options can be found in virtually every neighborhood, although a higher number appear in [[Staten Island]], [[Manhattan/East Village|the East Village]], [[Manhattan/Greenwich Village|Greenwich Village]], heavily Italian parts of Brooklyn like [[Brooklyn/Southwest Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] and [[Brooklyn/Southwest Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], and the area around Arthur Avenue in the [[Bronx]]. (Italian restaurants in Manhattan's \\\"Little Italy\\\" are mostly for tourists only, and New Yorkers generally avoid Mulberry St. between Canal and Broome. Likewise, you would be hard pressed to find locals eating in the chain restaurants [including chain pizzerias] around Times Square.)\\n\\nDue to the higher cost of living, you are in general expected to tip more in New York City than in other parts of the U.S. As a general rule, tips should start at 18% of the cost of the meal for adequate service, and may go up to 25% for service that goes above and beyond what is expected.\\n\\n====Dress codes====\\nRestaurants with entrees under $35 are unlikely to have any preference about what their customers wear. Of course, like most major cities, New York has some expensive, extremely fashionable restaurants that care about, and enforce, a certain level of dress among their customers - but \\\"jackets only\\\" restaurants are very uncommon nowadays to the point at which the restaurant's reputation would make the fact known.\\n\\nIf you're from elsewhere in the US and wish to \\\"pass\\\" as a local within Manhattan, pay attention to your shoes and coat. Most local exclusiveness is pretty understated, but where it exists it's generally to distinguish locals from nightlife commuters from New Jersey and Long Island that supposedly threaten to rob bar-filled neighborhoods of their local color. Therefore, if your style doesn't fit in but is obviously from outside the US, you may find yourself welcomed as graciously as any local, if not more so.\\n\\n===Vegetarians===\\nVegetarians and vegans will find New York to be a paradise with hundreds of vegetarian-only restaurants and good veggie options in even the most expensive places. There are many vegetarian-only restaurants with offerings varying from macrobiotic food to Ayurvedic thalis or Asian Buddhist food. But, more importantly, almost every restaurant at every point on the price scale has vegetarian dishes that are more than an afterthought. Even '''Per Se''', one of the most expensive and sought after restaurants in the city, has a seven course vegetarian tasting menu well worth the expense. DIY vegetarians will have no problem finding fresh vegetables, a wide variety of cheese, bread, and prepared vegetarian foods in New York supermarkets.\\n\\n===Street food===\\n[[File:StreetfoodNY.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|One of the many, many food carts in the city]]\\nNothing differentiates New York more from other American (and European) cities than the astonishing amount of [[street food|food cooked and served on the streets]]. Starting with the thousands of hot dog stands on almost every street corner, the possibilities are endless. People trek to [[Queens/Jackson Heights|Jackson Heights]] in Queens for a nibble of the famous arepas of the '''Arepa Lady'''. Freshly cooked Indian dosas are served up for a pittance at the '''NY Dosas''' stand in [[Manhattan/Greenwich Village|Washington Square Park]]. The '''Trinipak''' cart on 43rd and Sixth in Midtown serves delicious Trinidadian/Pakistani food. Danny Meyer, the famous restaurateur, runs the burger stand '''Shake Shack''' in [[Manhattan/Gramercy Flatiron|Madison Square Park]] as well as several other locations throughout the city. The halal offerings in Midtown are legendary ('''Kwik-Meal''' on 45th and Sixth; '''Halal Guys''' on 53rd and Sixth and many others). Most carts serve lunch from about 11AM to 5 or 6PM in the evening and disappear after dark, so look for a cart near you, smell what's cooking, and enjoy a hot and often tasty lunch for a few dollars (a meal costs anywhere from about $2 to $8). Mornings, from about 6AM to 10AM, the streets are dotted with coffee carts that sell coffee, croissants, bagels, and Danish pastries and are good for a cheap breakfast: small coffee and bagel for a dollar or so. From 10AM to 7PM, many vendors sell lunch and dinner choices, including hot dogs, hamburgers, gyros, and halal. Other street vendors sell Italian ices, pretzels, ice cream, and roasted peanuts. Also, look around for the coffee truck (often found in [[Manhattan/Gramercy Flatiron|Union Square]]), dessert truck, and the Belgian waffle truck that roam around the city.\\n\\n===Do it yourself===\\nNew York's many markets and grocery stores make preparing your own food interesting and easy. Almost every grocery store, deli, or bodega has a prepared foods section where you can make your own salad (beware, you are charged by the pound!) or buy ready-to-eat foods such as burritos, tacos, curries and rice, lasagna, pastas, pre-made or freshly-made sandwiches, and many other types of foods. Any supermarket will have enough to take away to the park or your hotel room for a low-cost meal. '''Whole Foods''' has five New York City locations, all with a variety of foods and a clean place to sit and eat. '''Zabar's''' on the [[Manhattan/Upper West Side|Upper West Side]] is very famous, with a huge selection of foodstuffs and expensive foods as well as cooking supplies. There is also a '''Trader Joe's''' at [[Manhattan/Gramercy Flatiron|Union Square]] and in 6 other locations in every borough but the Bronx for cheap but delicious supermarket buys, and '''Western Beef''' supermarkets offer more foods from different ethnicities than average supermarkets.\\n\\nIf you have a place to cook, you'll find almost any kind of food in New York, though you may have to travel to the outer boroughs for ethnic ingredients. Most supermarkets have Thai, Chinese, and Indian sauces to add flavor to your pot; many, especially in Upper Manhattan, have the ingredients necessary for a Mexican or Central American meal; and there are several H-Mart supermarkets around town for Korean ingredients and prepared foods; but go to [[Manhattan/Chinatown|Chinatown]] for the best Chinese ingredients, Little India in [[Manhattan/Gramercy Flatiron|Murray Hill]] for Indian ingredients, [[Queens/Flushing-Northeast|Flushing]] for all things Chinese or Korean, [[Queens/Jackson Heights|Jackson Heights]] for Peruvian, Ecuadorian, and South Asian, [[Brooklyn/Bedford-Stuyvesant and Flatbush|Flatbush and Crown Heights]] for Jamaican, [[Brooklyn/Williamsburg|Williamsburg]] for Kosher, and [[Brooklyn/Williamsburg|Greenpoint]] for Polish. Ask around for where you can get your favorite ethnic ingredients and you'll find traveling around in local neighborhoods a rewarding experience.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n<!-- ATTENTION ALL CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS PAGE!! New York City is a huge city, so all individual listings should be in the appropriate district articles, and this section should contain a brief overview. -->\\n'''Last call''' can be as late as 4AM, although many establishments will let you stay beyond that, especially in the outer boroughs. It is not uncommon to be locked in a bar after 4AM so people can keep drinking. Wine and liquor are sold at '''liquor stores''', and are not sold at delis or supermarkets. Beer cannot be bought between 4AM and 8AM on Sunday morning (although if you look hard, you can get around this).\\n\\nAs in most American cities, drinking alcoholic beverages on the street is illegal. The law is flouted openly in many areas, but bars will not generally let you take your drink outside.\\n\\n===Popular nightlife neighborhoods===\\nThe only thing about New York City that changes faster than the subway map or the restaurants is the bar scene. While some established watering holes have been around for decades or centuries, the hot spot of the moment may well have opened last week and could likely close just as quickly.\\n\\nOn [[Manhattan#Drink|Manhattan]], '''Greenwich Village''' is probably the best neighborhood to go if you are in town for just a brief period, full of locals of all ages, especially students attending NYU. '''Chelsea''' has lots of clubs and a thriving gay scene, and if you are European and looking for a discoth\\u00e8que, this is where you want to be. The '''Meatpacking District''' holds trendier bars and clubs and some expensive restaurants. The '''Lower East Side''', formerly the dingy alternative to the West Village, has become trendier today, with an influx of hipsters. The '''East Village''' also has lots of bars, as well as a sizeable cluster of Japanese bars. Nearby, '''Alphabet City''', once a dangerous drug-addled hell hole, has since cleaned up and is loaded with bars. '''Murray Hill''' is more hip with the 30-year-old crowd, with many Indian restaurants and plenty of watering holes, including a couple of fireman bars and an all Irish whiskey pub. '''Times Square''' is a very touristy area with a few classy hotel rooftop bars, although very few New Yorkers would be caught dead at these places.\\n\\nIn [[Brooklyn#Drink|Brooklyn]], '''Williamsburg''' is the capital of NYC's hipster scene, and many of New York's small music venues are here. '''Bay Ridge''' has one of the highest concentrations of bars in the city in a neighborhood that has been generally Irish/Italian and does not have the hipster/yuppie scene common in New York. '''Park Slope''', however, is the yuppie capital of New York and you are more likely to find a tea house serving soy milk than a bar here. There is some low-key nightlife, although this has been on the decline. A number of lesbian bars are in this area.\\n\\n[[Queens#Drink|Queens]] is home to '''Woodside''', an Irish neighborhood great for happy hour and drinking festivities before a Mets baseball game. '''Astoria''' is home to Queens' Bohemian Hall Beer Garden, which covers an entire city block, is walled and filled with trees, indoor and outdoor tables and a cool crowd, and serves great Czech and German beer. And on [[Staten Island#Drink|Staten Island]], '''St. George''' has a few bars located south of the ferry terminal, with good live music.\\n\\n===Jazz===\\nNYC has a pretty confident claim to be the world capital of jazz. It exerts a brain drain influence on the rest of the country's most talented jazz musicians, and the live music scene is simply thriving. This goes for all styles of jazz, (except pre-swing trad jazz, which safely belongs to [[New Orleans]]): Latin, modern, fusion, experimental, bebop, hard bop, you name it. '''The Blue Note''' in [[Manhattan/Greenwich Village|Greenwich Village]] is probably the most famous extant jazz club in the world, with nightly headliners and cover charges to match. The '''Village Vanguard''' is a legendary hole-in-the-wall (also in Greenwich Village), having played host to most of the greats going back to 1935. Other top (i.e., famous\\u2014there are fabulous lesser-known places to hear jazz throughout the city) clubs include '''Birdland''' in the [[Manhattan/Theater District|Theater District]] and the '''Cotton Club''' in [[Manhattan/Harlem and Upper Manhattan|Harlem]]. If the high cover charges in this expensive city are giving you the blues, look at '''Smalls''' and '''Cellar Dog''', which are within a block of each other in Greenwich Village and keep the covers as low as possible, so that musicians can actually afford to come!\\n\\n===Salsa===\\nWould it be too provocative to declare New York the home of salsa? Possibly, but there's a reason to consider it. Salsa originated in [[Cuba]], but its second home was New York (especially the [[Bronx]]), where it truly exploded and developed into a global phenomenon, driven by innovations from Cuban and later Puerto Rican immigrants. Latin dance, particularly salsa (danced on the two) and other Afro-Caribbean varieties, remains enormously popular, although it's now centered more on a semi-professional ballroom-dancing crowd rather than Latino communities. The '''Copacabana''' near [[Manhattan/Theater District|Times Square]] dates back to 1940, and is probably the city's best known Latin dance club. Other well known options include '''Club Cache''' also near Times Square, the very Dominican '''El Morocco''' in [[Manhattan/Harlem and Upper Manhattan|Spanish Harlem]], and '''Iguana''' in [[Manhattan/Theater District|west Midtown]]. Many venues in the city hold a salsa night once a week, so poke around the city papers for event listings.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n===Hotels===\\nNew York has some of the most expensive accommodations in the world. Expect to pay $100\\u2013$200 for a budget room with shared bath, $250\\u2013$350 for a mid-range hotel with a decent room and a restaurant and/or room service; and much higher in a high end hotel. Most accommodations below $200 in Manhattan are a small room with space only for a bed, a TV, perhaps a sink, and little else. Cheaper accommodations may have communal bathrooms (although many will have a sink in the room). Be warned that the quality of hotels varies significantly and, in many cheap hotels away from the center such as along the West Side Highway or in the outer reaches of Queens, you may share the premises with hourly customers! As New York is a popular destination throughout the year, it is necessary to make reservations well in advance. If you plan to be in the city during the height of the tourist season, booking months in advance would be wise. The two largest hotels in New York City are the [https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nycmq-new-york-marriott-marquis/overview/ Marriott Marquis] (on Times Square) and the [https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/nycnhhh-new-york-hilton-midtown/ Hilton Midtown] (on 6th Avenue between 53rd and 54th Streets); however, there are many other big-name hotels in the city, so the options are expansive.\\n\\n===Hostels===\\nExpect to pay up to $50 for a hostel. There are several hostels in Manhattan including an official [[Hostelling International]] hostel (located at 891 Amsterdam Avenue\\u2014between 102nd and 103rd Streets\\u2014in Manhattan), but there are many places that call themselves \\\"hostel\\\" and offer accommodations below $100 a night. Some cater exclusively to students. You are strongly advised to make reservations months in advance.\\n\\n===Taxes===\\nRoom rates are typically quoted excluding taxes, so expect your actual bill to be materially higher than the quoted rate. Taxes include New York State and New York City sales tax (8.875%), a New York City Hotel Occupancy Tax (varies but, for rooms above $40, $2 + 5.875%), and a surcharge of $1.50. For a $100 per night room, expect to pay $117.75, after taxes are taken into account.\\n\\n===Alternatives to Manhattan accommodations===\\nYou don't have to stay in Manhattan. There are many hotels just outside Manhattan in [[Queens/Long Island City|Long Island City]], [[Queens]], [[Brooklyn]] and [[New Jersey]] that are cheaper than hotels in Manhattan. Also, due to the high accommodation prices and insider knowledge of the locals, you may want to consider a [[hospitality exchange]].\\n\\n===Off-season===\\nLower accommodation prices are also generally available in January and February, the end of August, and on Sunday nights.\\n\\n==Connect==\\nFind free wireless wifi & hotspot across the city online at [http://www.openwifinyc.com/ openwifinyc], [http://www.nycwireless.net/ NYC Wireless], and [http://www.wififreespot.com/ WiFi Free Spot]. Wireless is available in city parks and quite a few public libraries. The Apple store has dozens of computers set up and doesn't seem to mind that many people use them for free internet access, but they can be pretty busy at times. Easy Internet Cafe and FedEx Office are just some of the internet cafes which offer broadband internet at reasonable prices. Finding a store with an open power outlet may be difficult so be sure your device is fully charged and its battery is working properly.\\n\\nPublic phones are less and less common, but there are now some free phone charging stations on the street if you are running out of power. Remember to include the 1 and area code when dialing from any phone in New York City - including private \\\"land line\\\" phones in buildings - as 11-digit dialing is always in effect, even when dialing locally. However, you don't need to dial 1 from a cell phone.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n{{cautionbox|boldtext=Cautions about firearms|New York City has some of the nation's strictest gun laws, and handgun permits issued elsewhere \\u2014 including New York State licenses \\u2014 are not honored within the five boroughs of the city.\\n\\nSome popular venues have a \\\"No guns\\\" sign posted outside, leading people to falsely assume such weapons are prohibited only in certain places. In fact, they're just as illegal outside these venues as inside. Attempting to leave weapons with security guards or police prior to entry will likely lead to very serious criminal charges.\\n\\nAs of Feb 2023, New York City's gun laws are in flux after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the city's gun permit law as unconstitutional. It is still advisable to avoid bringing a gun to New York City, even if you're just passing through by air (LaGuardia and JFK) or by car.}}\\nNew York was through 2019 statistically the safest large city in the United States, and its crime rate per person was lower than the national average and the crime rate of many small towns. 2020 saw a frightening jump in shootings, people being pushed onto the subway tracks and bias crimes, with those against people who are or look Asian increasing at the greatest rate, and the violence continued in 2021 and into 2022, but there has been a big drop in crime since then, and even during the spike, the city remained much safer than it used to be in the 1980s and 90s. You can be assured of a high police presence in Times Square, public transportation hubs and other major crowded places.\\n\\nThe most common crime against tourists (not including being overcharged, or scammed in the Times Square area) is bag snatching. Never let go of your handbag (putting other bags down is OK, as long as you guard them carefully), especially in the subway but also when eating at a restaurant. Take special care if you are sitting outdoors or in a crowded self-service restaurant. Leave your passport and other valuables that you don't need to carry in a hotel safe or hidden in your suitcase. Don't flaunt a wad of money if you can help it; if you want to be safer, count your money in your room before you go out and take only what you think you may need. Unless you have protective outer wear, consider not wearing expensive jewelry, and hide valuables like cameras when you're not using them.\\n\\nWhile muggings are rare, they do happen. Take a tip from seasoned New Yorkers and always try to be aware of who's walking near you in all directions (especially behind you), at all times. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you find yourself on a lightly traveled or poorly lit street. Certain neighborhoods that are off the tourist path should be avoided in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Riverside Park and Central Park can be dangerous at night. If you go to an evening outdoor concert at one of the parks, follow the crowd out of the park before heading toward your destination.\\n\\nAs of 2024, most neighborhoods that tourists or visitors to New York would venture into are quite safe. There are, however, some areas that have changed considerably since 2019 and would invite particular caution. These may not be immediately apparent to those unfamiliar with the city:\\n\\n* Be careful at all hours in the area encompassing the low 30s to low 40s, west of 8th Avenue. This area has a high homeless population and open drug use. Consider not walking on empty streets in this area at night. If your hotel or destination is in this area, consider taking a cab. Sticking to 34th Street or 42nd Street is a good bet if you are making your way west toward the river or Hudson Yards.\\n* Sixth Avenue and side streets in the West Village (particularly around the West 4th Street-Washington Square subway station) can be a little dicey late at night, outside of weekends.\\n* There are neighborhoods to the east of popular nightlife areas in Brooklyn that you can consider avoiding at night and visiting only during the day, particularly if you know where you're going and do not appear to be a tourist. These include eastern parts of Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant, as well as the neighborhoods of East New York, Brownsville, East Flatbush and Cypress Hills. The last four areas are particularly dangerous.\\n\\nIf you think you've inadvertently wandered into a dangerous area, hop into a cab, if available, or into the nearest subway station and go elsewhere, and if none of those is an option, don't hesitate to cross the street or duck into an open shop. If a subway platform is deserted, stay within sight of the station agent if possible. Trust your instincts; if a station or street feels unsafe, it's best to leave. In some areas (like the East New York LIRR station) helpful locals may even assist you in finding a safer place to go, or will wait/walk with you!\\n\\nAirport-style security is common at buildings, museums and tourist attractions, even the Main Branch of the New York Public Library. Generally you can expect to have your bags checked (either manually by a security guard or through an x-ray machine) and walk through a metal detector. Unlike their counterparts at JFK and LaGuardia, security screenings at building entrances are surprisingly quick and efficient - and you can even leave your shoes on!\\n\\nNew York has its share of odd people: talkative pan-handlers, lonely people just wanting a chat, religious preachers, people with psychological disorders, etc. If you prefer not to speak with someone who approaches you for a chat, do what most New Yorkers do: completely ignore them or say \\\"Sorry, gotta go\\\" while continuing to walk at a brisk pace.\\n\\nWatch out for cyclists and even motorcyclists riding, sometimes at high speeds, on the sidewalk or the wrong way on one-way streets. This has become a constant in some neighborhoods. Also, you will notice that New Yorkers routinely jaywalk, but don't do it yourself unless you have good sight lines and can do so safely.\\n\\nDespite the stereotypes, many New Yorkers are nice people and don't mind giving out directions (time allowing), so don't be afraid to ask! If you ever get into trouble, approach the nearest police officer. You'll find them to be friendly, polite, and very helpful.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n===Water===\\nThe quality of tap [[water]] in New York City is considered to be among the best in the world (unless you are in an old building with outdated plumbing). There is generally no good reason to drink bottled water in preference to New York City tap water. Lower-end restaurants will simply place glasses of ice water on your table (and refill them constantly, for free). At nicer restaurants you will be asked \\u201cwhat kind of water\\u201d you want. Asking for tap water is completely acceptable in any restaurant; your other choices are \\u201cbottled\\u201d (non-carbonated water, such as Fiji or Evian) or \\u201csparkling\\u201d (which almost always means Pellegrino).\\n\\n=== Noise ===\\nBeing the largest city in the country, New York City is true to its reputation as the \\\"city that never sleeps\\\". Traffic, honking horns, the loud chatter on the streets, musicians busking, and sirens are all undeniable parts of the city's soundscape. \\n\\nConsider buying a pair of earplugs or noise cancelling headphones to deal with the excessive noise.\\n\\n=== Toilets ===\\nPublic restrooms are few and far between in New York City. The parks department maintains [https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/bathrooms a list of \\\"comfort stations\\\" in their parks], and the [https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/bryant-park one at Bryant Park] in Manhattan is even something of a tourist attraction. Public libraries also have free restrooms, and [https://new.mta.info/agency/new-york-city-transit/bathrooms some subway stations] have restrooms open during the day. There are a small number of self-cleaning, coin-operated toilets in the city, which require quarters (25\\u00a2) and are always wheelchair-accessible. Large stores and sit-down restaurants usually have restrooms for paying customers. Otherwise, look for a church or police station that's open and ask if you can use the restroom.\\n\\n===Information===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Citizen Service Center | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=311 (lines open 24/7) | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia= | wikidata=\\n| lastedit=\\n| content= New York City's official non-emergency help line, available in 171 languages for questions (parade hours and routes, parking restrictions, transport problems) and complaints (litter, noise pollution, access).\\n}}\\n\\n===Babysitting===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Baby Sitters' Guild | alt= | url=http://www.babysittersguild.com | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1-212-682-0227 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Bookings 9AM\\u20139PM daily, cash payments only.

Multilingual sitters are also available.\\n}}\\n\\n===Smoking===\\nSmoking in public places is highly restricted. It is prohibited in indoor sections of bars, restaurants, subway stations and trains (all transit system property), public parks, public beaches, pedestrian malls, both indoor and outdoor stadiums and sports arenas, and many other public places. If you light up in any of these places, you are subject to a summons and fine, ejection, and/or indignant reactions from residents. There do remain a small number of legal cigar bars that are exempt, as are the outside areas of sidewalk cafes and the like, but these are very much the exception. If you need to smoke while eating or drinking, be prepared to take a break and join the rest of the smokers outside, whatever the weather; many establishments have large space heaters.\\n\\nThere is also some vaping on the streets of New York.\\n\\n====Cannabis/marijuana and other drugs====\\n'''Cannabis and marijuana are legal in New York''' for those 21 or older. Adults may possess up to 3 ounces of marijuana or up to 24 grams of cannabis concentrate and consume it anywhere tobacco smoking is permitted \\u2014\\u2014 it is the only jurisdiction in the USA where public marijuana smoking is legal. You will smell it walking down the street with some frequency.\\n\\nNew Yorkers are embracing legal weed with typical impatience and irreverence, and cannabis sales occur openly in every tourist-dominated area of the city, including Times Square and most Manhattan & Brooklyn parks.\\n\\nBecause NYC law only prohibits driving under the influence of cannabis and possession thereof by minors/children, you'll be hard-pressed to find a cop who'll lift a finger to stop open cannabis sales (they have bigger fish to fry), though unfortunately the way a dealer is treated by police often depends on skin color. Purchase cannabis at your own risk, but only the dealer commits a crime.\\n\\n'''Purchasing hard drugs in New York City is dangerous.''' Penalties for possession are draconian, including long prison sentences, and legal representation is expensive. Fake hard drugs and hard drugs laced with poisonous fentanyl are common.\\n\\n===Consulates===\\nNew York City is home to diplomatic missions from virtually every country on Earth due to the presence of the United Nations. Most countries have consulates here that double as the permanent mission to the United Nations, even if a country may otherwise not have diplomatic relations with the United States.\\n\\n{{Embassy|left=<br>\\n* {{flag|Albania}} {{listing\\n| name=Albania | alt= | url=http://www.ambasadat.gov.al/usa/en/new-york-consulate | email=\\n| address=320 E 79th St | lat= | long= |

D.C.|Washington]] Megalopolis corridor.\\n\\n===New Jersey===\\n\\nDespite being a constant target of mockery and jokes from New York, the densely-populated Garden State has plenty of great attractions to offer nearby:\\n\\n* '''Hudson Waterfront''' \\u2014 The portion of New Jersey that directly faces Manhattan along the Hudson River. The region is traversed by the {{convert|18.5|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} '''Hudson River Waterfront Walkway''' that runs, albeit discontinuously, from the George Washington Bridge down to the city of Bayonne and offers clear views of the Manhattan skyline.\\n** '''[[Jersey City]]''' \\u2014 Directly across the Hudson River from the Financial District is New Jersey's second largest city. Jersey City is a diverse city with lots of multicultural shops and restaurants, and it is often referred to as New York\\u2019s \\\"sixth borough\\\". It can be reached from Manhattan via the Holland Tunnel, the PATH trains (the bi-state subway), buses from Port Authority or the many ferries that zip passengers across the Hudson River.\\n** '''[[Hoboken]]''' \\u2014 Directly across the Hudson River from the West Village and Chelsea is the alleged birthplace of baseball (most erroneously believe that the birthplace is Cooperstown, NY) and actual birthplace of Frank Sinatra. Hoboken is a small city in area with a great assortment of prewar buildings and conspicuous lack of many corporate establishments. The piers have great views of Manhattan, a large selection of bars, restaurants, and clubs, and are a good place to walk around. Hoboken can be reached from Manhattan by the PATH train or by bus from Port Authority as well as by NY Waterway ferries.\\n** '''[[Fort Lee]]''' \\u2014 Occupying the western end of the George Washington Bridge, Fort Lee is home to the site of the eponymous Revolutionary War fort, as well as a high concentration of Korean and Japanese restaurants that spill deep into the neighboring towns. Fort Lee is easily reached by walking, biking, or taking a bus/jitney across the George Washington Bridge from the adjacent bus terminal on the Manhattan side of the bridge.\\n* '''[[Jersey Shore]]''' \\u2014 The Jersey Shore starts just a few miles south of New York City. It stretches for almost {{mi|130}}, and along it are private and public beaches. There are numerous activities along the Jersey Shore. [[Sandy Hook]], part of the National Gateway Area and home to one of the few nude beaches around New York, Gunnison Beach, can be easily accessed using the SeaStreak ferry from Manhattan. The service operates during the beach season and goes directly to the Hook. A convenient train ride on the NJ Transit trains from Penn Station will get you to several more of the towns on the Jersey Shore, including [[Asbury Park]], [[Manasquan]] and [[Point Pleasant Beach]]. Buses from Port Authority also take passengers to other spots along the Jersey Shore not served by train from New York, such as [[Seaside Heights]].\\n** '''[[Atlantic City|Atlantic City]]''', '''[[Wildwood (New Jersey)|Wildwood]]''', and '''[[Cape May]]''' at the southern edge of New Jersey are home to beaches, casinos in Atlantic City, restaurants, shopping, and entertainment.

Six Flags Great Adventure features plenty of monster roller coasters and is next to the Wild Safari (one of the largest drive-through safaris in the world). There is also Six Flags Hurricane Harbor right next door (the largest water park in the Northeast). New Jersey Transit provides bus service from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan when the park is open (May\\u2013October).\\n* '''[[Princeton]]''' \\u2014 Also an easy train ride on New Jersey Transit, Princeton offers a quiet, tree-lined town, good for strolling or for visiting the Princeton University campus.  Take the Northeast Corridor line to Princeton Junction, then transfer to the shuttle train (known locally as the \\\"Dinky\\\") to ride directly into campus.\\n* '''[[Newark (New Jersey)|Newark]]''' \\u2014 Although most tourists only come here to arrive or depart in the city\\u2019s international airport, Newark is also home to Branch Brook Park, which contains one of the largest collections of cherry trees in the nation and makes for a great day trip during cherry blossom season in the spring, and the Ironbound, a district full of Portuguese, Brazilian, and Spanish restaurants and cuisine. Newark is a major transport hub in the New York area, with NJ Transit and PATH trains frequently operating to/from Midtown and Lower Manhattan.\\n* '''[[Paterson]]''' is a sizable, diverse city whose main attraction, the very extensive Great Falls of the Passaic River, is worth a trip if you have extra time during your visit to New York.\\n\\n===New York State===\\n\\n* '''[[Long Island]]''' \\u2014  Many New Yorkers visit Long Island's beautiful long white sand beaches during the summer. You can take the Long Island Rail Road from Penn Station to [[Long Beach (New York)|Long Beach]] ($9.00 off-peak or $12.50 peak), and go to the beach there, or another option is to take a long day trip on the Hampton Jitney from various stops in NYC to the East End, where Long Island wine country is on the [[North Fork]] and [[The Hamptons]] are on the South Fork.\\n* '''[[Fire Island]]''' \\u2014 an all-pedestrian summer-resort island off the coast of Long Island. Fire Island is home to many vacation communities on the western part of the island (Ocean Beach being the most populous, with the most restaurants and bars that make an excellent day trip). The eastern part of the island is home to the largely gay communities of Cherry Grove and the Fire Island Pines. Western Fire Island is reachable by ferry from Bay Shore on Long Island. Bay Shore is about an hour's train ride on the Long Island Rail Road from Manhattan, and the ferry ride from Bay Shore is another 30 minutes. Ferries to Ocean Beach from Bay Shore run about once every hour during the summer. Cherry Grove and the Fire Island Pines are reachable by ferry from Sayville. The easternmost community, Davis Park, is reachable by ferry from Patchogue.\\n* '''The [[Palisades]]''' \\u2014 On the western bank of the Hudson River, there are cliffs that rise sharply. These cliffs are known as the Palisades. They range from 300 to 500 feet. They start in the northern portion of Jersey City and stretch all the way to Nyack, New York. There are numerous viewpoints, trails and campsites along the Palisades. The Palisades can be easily reached from Manhattan via the George Washington Bridge. Palisade Interstate Park and Parkway start north of the bridge.\\n* '''[[Westchester County]]''' and the '''[[Hudson Valley]]''' \\u2014 Home to the country's only government-operated theme park - [[Rye (New York)|Rye]] Playland - as well as beautiful neighborhoods. There are pretty communities along the Long Island Sound and inland, and the Hudson Valley (which extends north of Westchester) is truly beautiful; the train route (Metro North Hudson Line to [[Poughkeepsie]] or Amtrak to [[Albany (New York)|Albany]]) along the Hudson River is one of the loveliest in the country. Westchester County starts just north of the NYC borough of the Bronx.\\n* '''[[Adirondacks|The Adirondacks]]''' are the largest state park in the United States, and are only a 3- to 4-hour drive away on I-87. The area is home to mountains, small villages, and winter sports.\\n* Western New York is the land of the '''[[Finger Lakes|Finger Lakes]]''', '''[[Niagara Falls]]''', '''[[Thousand Islands|Thousand Islands]]''', and nice towns.

Megabus and Greyhound also provide transportation.\\n* '''[[Cape Cod]]''', a 5-hour drive from New York north on I-95, is home to nice towns, restaurants, beaches, shopping, and entertainment. Also accessible by Peter Pan Bus Lines.\\n* '''[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]''' \\u2014 Beantown, home to the Freedom Trail, incredible seafood, Harvard University in nearby [[Cambridge (Massachusetts)|Cambridge]], and the Boston Red Sox (who are the most hated sports team of most New Yorkers), is 4 hours north on I-95 ($32-38 one way by bus on Greyhound and Peter Pan; Megabus sometimes charges more), with a bus from Port Authority Bus Terminal every hour around the clock or $20-102 one way on Amtrak's Northeast Regional from Penn Station as of April 2024 if bought far enough in advance.\\n* The rest of '''[[New England]]''' has a lot to offer, including national parks, beaches, mountains and skiing.\\n\\n===Elsewhere===\\n\\n* '''[[Philadelphia]]''' \\u2014 The birthplace of American independence and the nation's first capital is 1 hour 20 minutes away by Amtrak, very feasible for a day trip or side trip from New York City. A cheaper but somewhat slower method of getting there is to either take the NJ Transit Northeast Corridor Line to Trenton and change for SEPTA or take a bus from Midtown or Chinatown.\\n* '''[[Washington, D.C.]]''' is the capital of the United States and a three-hour train ride on the Acela. The National Mall, the White House, and the Lincoln Memorial are just a few of the numerous attractions that D.C. has to offer.\\n* There are more beaches to check out in '''[[Delaware]]''' and '''[[Maryland]]''', such as '''[[Ocean City (Maryland)|Ocean City]]''' and '''[[Rehoboth Beach]]'''\\n* '''[[Montreal]]''' is a 7-hour drive away, plus time to go through the checkpoint at the border.

The city's population is about 600,000 with about 1.6 million in the metropolitan area (2019). It is in the southeastern portion of the state on the western shore of '''Lake Michigan'''.\\n\\n[[Image:Milwaukee Art Museum.JPG|thumb|250px|Milwaukee Art Museum]]\\n==Understand==\\n\\n===History and culture===\\nMilwaukee's human history begins with American Indian people who lived near the confluence of Milwaukee's three rivers into Lake Michigan for centuries. Tribes who inhabited the area that is now Milwaukee included Menominee, Fox, Mascouten, Sauk, and Potawatomi. With the arrival of Europeans and an increasing population, large and often violent divides become more prominent. These settlers built three dueling settlements, Juneautown, Kilbourntown, and Walker's Point, around what is now Downtown. The two former communities were extremely competitive and created two non-aligning street grids. This is why 1st Street is west of the Milwaukee River and many of the city's bridges cross the river diagonally (connecting the two grids).\\n\\nMilwaukee has historically been a major immigrant city. During the early 20th century, German and Polish immigrants tended to dominate. The city still strongly identifies with its German and Polish heritage. For part of the early 20th-century German was even the main language of the city, and German names are still very common.\\n\\nAs waves of immigrants arrived in Milwaukee they tended (and tend) to form communities in specific areas. The Near North and Northwest sides were originally German, but are now mainly African American with Hmong enclaves. The Near South side was originally Polish but is now mainly Mexican. Juneautown was originally mainly populated by English immigrants as well as people from the eastern United States.\\n\\nIn the 1960s and 70s many white Milwaukeeans moved to the suburbs (\\\"white flight\\\") creating a large racial and socio-economic divide between the city and suburbs. Today the city remains highly segregated with low rates of social and economic mobility for African Americans.\\n\\nMilwaukee is home to some instantly recognized corporations such as '''Miller Brewing''' and '''Harley Davidson'''. Harley holds an enormous celebration on every fifth anniversary. The 120th anniversary was celebrated in August\\u00a02023.\\n\\nMilwaukee was once the home to four of the world's largest breweries (Schlitz, Blatz, Pabst, and Miller), making it the number one beer producing city in the world for many years. Despite the decline in its position as the world's leading beer producer through the loss of three of those breweries, its one remaining major brewery, Miller Brewing Company is a key employer. Miller employs over 2,200 people on Milwaukee's west side. All this beer brewing has earned the city the nickname \\\"Brew City\\\" and its identification with and fondness for beer remains strong as ever. \\n\\nMilwaukee has advertised itself as the \\\"City of Festivals,\\\" especially emphasizing an annual summer party along the lakefront called '''[http://www.summerfest.com/ Summerfest]'''. Listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as \\\"the largest music festival in the world\\\", Summerfest attracts about a million visitors a year to its twelve stages. Smaller ethnic festivals throughout the summer celebrate many of Milwaukee's ethnic groups.\\n\\nAnother city nickname, \\u201cCream City\\u201d, is often mistakenly thought to refer to Wisconsin being an abundant dairy producer or to the creamy head on top of a draft beer. In actuality, the name refers to the distinctive [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_City_brick cream colored bricks] used in many of the older buildings in the downtown area. \\n\\n===Geography===\\nMilwaukee is in the northern Midwest, along the shores of Lake Michigan.

It has also served as the backdrop for numerous Hollywood films. The films ''Bridesmaids'', ''Transformers 3'', ''Mr. 3000'' and ''Milwaukee, Minnesota'' were set in the area.

Milwaukee is the second coldest major city in the country; winter is very long and cold! Spring is often very wet and sometimes cold and miserable. It is not unheard of to get snowfall in early April. Winter visitor may quickly get an idea why there are so many bars, bowling alleys and festivals in Milwaukee. The best time to visit is by far in the summer or the early fall during Indian Summer when the whole place comes to life and everybody is outside.

Block numbers are consistent across the city, including most of the suburbs, starting roughly where the Milwaukee and Menominee rivers meet. All numbered streets run north-south, increasing in number as you head west from 1st Street. Most named streets go east-west, with the notable exception of streets east of 1st St. Standard blocks are 1/8th of a mile long north to south, and 1/16th of a mile east to west.\\n\\n===By public transit===\\n====Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS)====\\nMilwaukee's bus system, '''[http://www.ridemcts.com MCTS]''', has an extensive coverage area (85% of Milwaukee County) and core routes with very frequent service. Outlying suburbs have shorter hours, slower and less-frequent service. Express buses called \\\"UBuses\\\" offer service to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. MCTS also serves Mitchell International Airport with both a local bus and a new, more express route; see '''Get In''' for details. Most routes run from about 5AM until at least midnight.\\n\\n'''Fares''':\\n\\nSingle trips are $2. For visitors with a smartphone, the easiest way to pay is via the '''[https://www.ridemcts.com/fares/umo-app Umo app]'''. For those who do not wish to use mobile payment, MCTS also has a contactless smart card known as the '''[https://www.ridemcts.com/fares/how-to-use-the-wisgo-card WisGo card]''' that allows you to load stored value. There is a one-time fee of $2 to purchase a WisGo card, which can be purchased online or at 120 sales outlets in Milwaukee County; they are not sold by bus drivers. The Umo app and WisGo card can also be used on the [[Waukesha]] Metro, which has connections to MCTS.\\n\\nAt the stops for Connect 1, a bus rapid transit line from downtown Milwaukee to the regional medical center in [[Wauwatosa]], there are ticket vending machines. While they are intended for use on that route, they print tickets that are valid on any route for 90 minutes. The machines accept cash (exact change only) and card payments.\\n\\nIf you are going to be using public transit a lot while in Milwaukee, it would be a good idea to use the Umo app or WisGo Card since paper transfers for cash fares have been eliminated. Additionally, for payments with the Umo app or WisGo Card, fares are capped at $5 daily, $20 weekly, and $75 monthly.\\n\\nDrivers and ticket vending machines only accept exact fare for those paying with cash. If you are paying cash and do not have exact change, you will not have any choice but to pay extra.\\n\\nThere are automated audio-visual stop announcements. If you need any information don't hesitate to ask the bus operator for help. Most drivers know the city well and will be happy to give you directions or call your stop.\\n\\n====The Hop streetcar====\\n'''[https://thehopmke.com/ The Hop]''' is a streetcar operating in downtown from the Amtrak station to Burns Commons. It opened in 2018.

Bike maps are available from the [https://mclio.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html Milwaukee County website] or from the city or for sale at local shops. Weather permitting, Milwaukee is a very pleasant place to [[cycling|bicycle]]. There are several separated bike lanes and network of leisurely trails called the Oak Leaf Trail.  Some are even limited access paths (think: bike freeway) as well as 65 mi (105 km) of on-street bike lanes and 75 mi (121 km) of signed bike routes (the city  aims to raise that number to several hundred miles of on-street bike lanes as streets are re-paved).\\n\\n====Bikeshare====\\n'''[http://bublrbikes.com Bublr Bikes]''' is Milwaukee's bikeshare system. Bike stations are mostly concentrated in the greater downtown area and the East Side. Single rides cost $3 for 30 minutes and can be paid for with a credit card at any bike station. Bublr also sells 30-day passes online for $15, which allows for unlimited free rides in 60-minute increments; you can avoid additional charges by returning a bike within that time frame and hopping on a new one.\\n\\n====Bicycle rentals and tours====\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Milwaukee Bike and Skate Rental | alt= | url=http://www.milwbikeskaterental.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat=43.05095 | long=-87.89009 | directions=\\n| phone=+1 414-273-1343 | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2022-04-24\\n| content=A kiosk in Veterans Park on the Lake Michigan shore, just north of the art museum.\\n}}\\n\\n'''Bicycle Shops''' are also often willing to do rentals, and also sell high-quality products that are often locally made:\\n* {{marker|type=listing|name=[https://www.benscycle.com/ Ben's Cycle/Milwaukee Bicycle Company]|lat=43.00260|long=-87.92532}} sells top-notch locally made bicycles and has the best selection of track and '''fixed gear''' equipment in the Midwest.\\n* {{marker|type=listing|name=[https://www.bikecollective.org/ Milwaukee Bicycle Collective]|lat=43.03628|long=-87.95120}} is useful if you need a space and some tools to fix your bike while traveling, they have assorted hours and suggested donation rates.\\nIt is fairly easy to find a used bike in good working condition at local thrift stores, which is much cheaper than renting if you are going to be staying in the city for any length of time.\\n\\nAll MCTS buses have bicycle racks which are free to use with bus fare, so if you get tired, lost, the weather turns bad or whatever you can hop on the bus.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\nWhile there are plenty of taxis to meet demand, do not expect to simply flag one down. With the notable exceptions of queues at larger hotels, the airport, train- and bus stations, largely attended events and most of the downtown area, you should call for one. Even going from the Upper East Side to Downtown can cost $20.

Visitors parking overnight on city streets should call the City at {{phone|+1 414 286-8300}} by 1AM to request parking permission. Overnight parking can also be registered for free (up to 3 nights) online at [http://mpw.milwaukee.gov/services/np_permission the DPW's night parking site].\\n\\nParking outside the Downtown/East Side is overall a non-issue.

There are a number of coffee shops and restaurants, but except for around Cathedral Square and Milwaukee Street area mostly closes down after business hours.\\n\\nAcross the river, Kilbourntown (or Westown) serves as the city's entertainment center. Here you will find attractions such as the Wisconsin Center, Milwaukee's primary convention center. Nearby are the Grand Avenue Mall, the Milwaukee Theater, and the Bradley Center. Many of the city's hotels are here as well, as are some excellent restaurants and clubs. Further to the west is Milwaukee's gigantic neo-classical Courthouse, the Milwaukee Public Museum, and the ornate Milwaukee Central Library.\\n\\nThe Riverwalk lines both sides of the Milwaukee River through the downtown area, and is home to a number of pieces of public art, as well as some of the city's most popular restaurants.\\n[[File:Third Ward MKE.jpg|thumb|Street in the Third Ward]]\\n*'''Historic Third Ward''' - This small district, directly to the south of Juneautown, is Milwaukee's version of the trendy urban \\\"warehouse district.\\\" The streets of the Third Ward are lined with 19th and early 20th-century warehouse buildings which have been converted into lofts and offices. At street level, chic shops and restaurants are commonplace.

On Gallery Night, which occurs once every three months, the Third Ward hums with activity, as it is home to the city's largest collection of art galleries. The Third Ward is also home to the newest section of the Riverwalk, which offers some fantastic views of the downtown skyline. The Third Ward is within walking distance of downtown.\\n*'''Fifth Ward/Walker's Point''' Founded by George Walker in June of 1835 as a fur trading post, Walker's settlement was combined with Juneautown and Kilbourntown to become the City of Milwaukee in 1846. Walker also contributed to the building of the city's first streetcar line in 1859. Walker's Point is south of the Third Ward, and is served by the #18, 15, and 19 buses from Downtown. The northern part of the neighborhood (especially north of National Avenue) is a rapidly re-developing warehouse district, home to many popular restaurants, cafes, clubs, and bars, while the southern and western parts are mainly Hispanic.

Milwaukeeans spend more (per capita) on entertainment than the citizenry of any other major American city, and you can bet that a good percentage of that entertainment is served in liquid form. Despite the amount of money spent on it, drinking is still very cheap. Expect to pay $4 for a decent local beer or import, $2 for a Pabst, Hamm's, Old Style or Schlitz. Read the specials boards, there are often great deals, for instance, a pint of a dark local micro-brew for $2 several places on Thursday and many places have $1 PBR or Old Style. '''Cover''' is only charged at some places with live music, bigger clubs, or if there is a special very cheap drink night. Every bar can serve you mixed drinks, but wine is less popular. '''Closing time''' is an early 2AM during the week and 2:30AM on Friday and Saturday. All retail alcohol sales stop at 9PM.\\n\\nWith 957 licensed taverns it's hard to go thirsty. There is a corner bar at least every few blocks, no matter where you are in Milwaukee. Plus there are several handfuls of licensed ''dance halls'' (what kids call clubs and venues these days), if you want to get your groove on. Other popular nighttime activities include bowling (black-light bowling at midnight), movies, concerts, and theater.\\n\\nMany of the main places to go out in Milwaukee are concentrated in a few different areas, which are easy to walk around and bar-hop within. Cabs are also easy to hail Downtown and on the East Side.\\n\\n'''Downtown''' the biggest bar street is Water St with a heavy drinking scene. Across the river to the west is Old World 3rd St with some German-inspired taverns and sports bars (it's near the Bradley Center arena). Back across the river and up the hill to the east is Milwaukee Street, hosting a wide range of classier, more upscale small bars.\\n\\nThe '''East Side''' has two of the city's main bar areas: on Brady Street and on North Ave between Oakland and Prospect.\\n\\nBrady Street is full of people outside during the summer and has a mix of different bars, cafes, and restaurants.\\n* {{drink\\n| name=Wolski's | url=http://www.wolskis.com/ | email=\\n| address=1836 N Pulaski St | lat=43.055218 | long=-87.896615 | directions=\\n| phone=+1 414 276-8130 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=M-Th 2PM-2AM, F 2PM-2:30AM, Sa noon-2:30AM, Su noon-2AM | price=cheap\\n| content= Famous neighborhood tavern in the historic district just north of Brady.

Milwaukee has a youth hostel and an array of hotels to meet most budgets. There is a small '''bed and breakfast''' district on the Westside.\\n\\nCheap hotels can be found on the Near South Side as well as the North Side, the quality of these tends to reflect the average quality of life in the areas these are in, hence may not be up to the standards of relatively affluent travelers.\\n\\nMore generic cheaper hotels are outside the urban city. For instance, there is a strip of budget hotels on College Ave near Mitchell International Airport. Near most interstates you can also find chain hotels.\\n\\n===Bed and Breakfast===\\nThere are several B&Bs in the Concordia Historic District on Milwaukee's West Side and near Marquette University.

Since most crime is concentrated in specific poorer areas, the majority of the city is perfectly safe. Though virtually all tourist destinations in and around Milwaukee are safe and accessible during the day and night, common sense should always apply. Like anywhere else, it helps to be aware of your surroundings. As in most American cities, dangerous neighborhoods tend to be very run down.\\n\\nThe areas of Milwaukee along the lakeshore (also where most attractions are) tend to be the safest.\\n\\nThe west and south sides of Milwaukee also offer interesting tourist opportunities that include Milwaukee's famous Basilica and Frank Lloyd Wright's Greek Orthodox church. Crime can happen anywhere; don't let geographic stereotypes dictate your travels.\\n\\nThe area bounded by I-43 on the east, Capitol Dr on the north, North Ave on the south and Sherman Blvd on the west contains some of the poorest areas of the city and is especially dangerous. The Near South Side also has serious gang-related crime problems but is fine during the day, especially along the main commercial streets.\\n\\n==Connect==\\n\\n===Newspapers===\\nMany community and neighborhood oriented weekly papers are offered for free in cafes and coffee shops.\\n\\n* '''''[http://www.jsonline.com The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]''''' is Milwaukee's only major daily newspaper, distributed in the morning. $0.50 daily, $1.75 Sunday Edition.\\n* '''''[http://www.shepherd-express.com The Shepherd Express]''''' is Milwaukee's free-press publication.\\n* '''''[http://www.onmilwaukee.com OnMilwaukee.com]''''' has lots of reviews and event listings online.\\n\\n==Cope==\\nAlso, the suburbs of Ozaukee, Waukesha, and Racine Counties have a reputation for being politically and socially conservative. It's your best bet just to go with the flow here. If you are an LGBT visitor, displays of affection will turn heads in these areas. Some suburbs are even more conservative than the rural parts of the state. Milwaukee is not as socially liberal as [[Madison (Wisconsin)|Madison]], although people in Milwaukee are overall tolerant of each other, even if many of the assorted social and ethnic groups tend to avoid each other. Clique culture is big in the region and many people grew up together so don't be surprised to get an unfriendly reception from some people you meet being an outsider. Dressing in a non-conservative manner here (keeping up with fashion trends, v-necks, high fashion, etc.) is generally frowned upon in southeast Wisconsin and will get you some funny looks from locals so if this kind of attention bothers you then pack accordingly.  The city is becoming more and more laid back.\\n\\n===Consulates===\\n\\n* {{flag|Belgium}} {{listing\\n| name=Belgium (Honorary) | alt= | url=http://unitedstates.diplomatie.belgium.be/en/embassy-and-consulates/honorary-consulates/addresses | email=ebridge@salawus.com\\n| address=330 East Kilbourn Ave., Suite 1100 Tower 1 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+1 414 847-6154 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2017-06-24\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Mexico}} {{listing\\n| name=Mexico | alt= |. url=https://consulmex.sre.gob.mx/milwaukee/ | url=https://m.facebook.com/ConsulMexMilwaukee/ | email=conmilwaukee@sre.gob.mx\\n| address=1443 N.

It has the oldest university in the Western world, a lively student population, excellent food, a striking brick terracotta-roofed cityscape, and lots to see and do. The city itself has a population just under 395,000 in 2020. Until 2015 it was part of a \\\"Province of Bologna\\\" but this was absorbed into a metropolitan area, population 1,017,000. This page therefore covers the entire metropolis, with the exception of [[Imola]], described separately.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:2tours bologne 082005.jpg|thumb|Two towers of Bologna]]\\nBologna is famous for its cuisine (''la cucina Bolognese''). It is also viewed as a progressive and well-administered city. It has one of the largest and best preserved historic centers among Italian cities. Its architecture is noted for its palette of terracotta reds, burnt oranges, and warm yellows, hence the name of ''Bologna la rossa'' (Bologna the red). The extensive town center, characterized by miles of attractive covered walkways, known as \\\"porticos,\\\" is one of the best-preserved in Europe.\\n\\nBologna is the seat of the oldest university in continental Europe, founded in 1088. A significant portion of its population consists of away-from-home university students. In common with other Italian university towns, it is in parts marred by excessive graffiti on its historic palaces.\\n\\n===History===\\n\\nThe strategic location of the city molded its history. Inhabited since the 10th century BC during the Iron Age, it was fortified by the Celts and became a municipality under the Romans. The presence through the centuries of the Huns, [[Goths]], Lombards, Franks, Austrians and French, have each left traces which are still visible in the city today.\\n\\nBologna struggled for autonomy, having been dominated by emperors, kings, and the Church. It was ruled by the Pepoli and Bentivoglio families, and was a papal fiefdom. The papal power made it a city of the Guelphs, while many of its residents supported the anti-Papal Ghibellines. Bologna had the first city council in Italy, and was, with the Liber Paradisus law in 1256, one of the first cities in the world to abolish slavery. This political activity was rooted in the lively environment surrounding the ''Alma Mater'', as the university was known.\\n\\nBologna was the home of such personalities as ''Father Martini'', a collector, composer and master of counterpoint who was a notable and complex protagonist of European music of the thirteenth century. Among his students were ''Johann Christian Bach'' (son of J.S Bach) and the young ''W.A Mozart''. During the 19th century the Philharmonic Academy drew important personalities such as ''Rossini, Verdi, Brahms, Wagner, Puccini and Liszt''.\\n\\nBologna was named a ''[[UNESCO Creative Cities|Creative City of Music by UNESCO]]'' in 2006. Music is performed throughout the city: in the ''Teatro Comunale'' (the Opera Theatre), by the ''Orchestra Mozart'' youth orchestra, founded and directed by Claudio Abbado, and in clubs and inns where jazz is regularly played. There are open-air concerts and music can be heard at the Conservatory, the Opera School, and hundreds of music associations operating within the territory.\\n\\nBologna's scientists have included ''Galvani'' and ''Marconi''. Native or visiting painters and artists have included ''Morandi'', ''Guido Reni, Guercino, the Carraccis, Leonardo'' (one of the legends about the Mona Lisa tells that this was where he painted his famous masterpiece), ''Giotto'' (there was a chapel in Piazza XX Settembre entirely painted a fresco by Giotto which was destroyed when Bologna was fighting against the Pope), ''Cassini'' (who made the world\\u2019s longest sundial, now located inside Basilica S. Petronio), and ''Michelangelo'' (on the arc in Basilica S. Domenico can be found his sculpture of an angel holding a candelabra). ''Napoleon'' re-arranged the urban plan of the city and ''Carlo V'' was crowned emperor in Bologna's Basilica S. Petronio.\\n\\n===When to visit===\\nBologna is at its best from March/April to October, when it is warm and there is much outdoor sipping and dining, or just sitting in squares such as Piazza Santo Stefano and Piazza Maggiore. However, during July and August it can be very hot and sticky. In August, as is the case in much of Italy in the summer, many shops and restaurants are closed for the summer vacation.\\n\\nWinter can be cold, but Bologna is beautiful the two weeks before Christmas. January and February often feature cloudless blue skies, but the clear weather is often the coldest: you will need a coat, scarf, hat and gloves.\\n\\n===Tourist information===\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Bologna Welcome | alt=Convention & Visitor Bureau of Bologna | url=http://www.bolognawelcome.com/en/ | email=\\n| address=Piazza Maggiore 1/e | lat=44.494338 | long=11.343191 | directions=\\n| phone=+39 051 239660 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=M-Sa 09:00-19:00, Su 10:00-17:00 | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2016-07-24\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By plane===\\nBologna's airport is approximately 6 km NW from the centre of the city:\\n\\n* {{go\\n| name=Guglielmo Marconi (Bologna) International Airport | alt={{IATA|BLQ}} | url=http://www.bologna-airport.it/ | email=\\n| address=Via Triumvirato, 84 | lat=44.534573 | long=11.287937 | directions=\\n| phone=+39 051 6479615 | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=Q389241\\n| lastedit=2016-04-08\\n| content=The airport has international connections available, including nonstop flights from [[Amsterdam Schiphol]], Brussels (National), [[Charleroi]] (\\\"Brussels\\\" South), [[Copenhagen Airport]], Dublin, Edinburgh, [[Ia\\u0219i]], Istanbul<!--WHICH AIRPORT-->, Lisbon, London<!--WHICH AIRPORT-->, [[Madrid Barajas]], [[Manchester Airport]], Moscow<!--WHICH AIRPORT-->, Paris<!--WHICH AIRPORT-->, Prague, [[Vienna Airport]], and Zagreb (seasonal).\\n}}\\n\\nServices:\\n* '''WiFI''' \\u2013 free, registration required.\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Left luggage | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=1st floor of the main terminal\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=24/7 | price=\\u20ac6 per item\\n|wikipedia=|wikidata=|image=| lastedit=2016-04-08\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name= Bologna Welcome - Airport| alt=Tourist Information Office | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=ground floor at the Arrivals Area\\n| phone= +39 051 6472201| tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= M-Sa 09:00-19:00, Su 10:00-17:00| price=\\n| lastedit=2016-04-09\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\nConnections to the city:\\n* '''[https://www.marconiexpress.it/en/ Marconi Express]''' monorail service connects the airport with the ''Bologna Centrale'' railway station in 7 minutes.

Modern high speed railway lines arrive in Bologna from [[Florence]] in 37 minutes, from [[Milan]] in 65 minutes, from [[Rome]] in 2 hr 20 min, from [[Venice]] in 2 hours, and from [[Ferrara]] in 30 min -1 hour.\\n\\nThere are Eurocity trains from [[Munich]] (Germany) and overnight Nightjet services from [[Munich]] (Germany) and [[Vienna]] (Austria).\\n\\nWhen leaving, watch out to go to the right platform: for example, 3, 3-West, and 3-East are separate platforms in different areas of the station.\\n\\nWhile taking the train south from Milan, don't forget to catch a glimpse of the ''Duomo'' perched above Bologna in the south.

Its strategic position allows you to get here from Milan, Florence, Rome and Naples with the A1 motorway. The city is at the junction of the A1, A14 and A13 highways, and so is easily accessible from anywhere in Italy. Most traffic from Milan would exit the A1 and take the ''Tangenziale'', but beware of this road at rush hour because it is horrendously packed. Expect to use 2 hours from the A1 exit to the Tangenziale to the center at certain peak times over summer busy weekends, especially at the beginning and end of August. To get there from Ferrara, Padua and Venice, take the A13, while as regards the coast, the A14 is also used. The city is also crossed by the Via Emilia which connects Milan with the Adriatic coast.\\n\\n== Get around ==\\n{{mapframe | 44.500 | 11.340 | height=550 | width=550 | zoom=14 }}\\n{{mapshape}}\\n===By bus===\\n[http://www.tper.it/percorsi-orari/servizio-bacino-di-bologna TPER] manages public transport in Bologna.

It is also a great way to find hidden gems which are frequented by locals. Some care has to be taken crossing roads: the city centre swarms with scooters and small motorcycles (cars banned during the day) and they ride them everywhere.\\n\\n==See==\\n\\n[[File:Fontneptbologne_082005.jpg|thumb|Neptune fountain]]\\n\\n===Layout of the city===\\nThe iconic leaning towers (''Due Torri'') provide a useful central landmark.

The central area around ''Piazza Maggiore'' (including the ''Due Torri'' and ''Piazza Santo Stefano'' can be thought of as the hub of a wheel, with other roads leading out like spokes to the old city gates (''Porte'') that stud the ''Viali''\\u2014a heavily trafficked beltway that surrounds the historical centre of the town. The northeast quadrant of the map is the university district (an integral part of the town rather than a separate campus). The two southern quadrants of your map are residential sections of the city, and not common tourist areas. However, Bologna's main park, the ''Giardini Margherita'', is just outside the center (across the ''Viali'' from ''Porta Santo Stefano'' or ''Porta Castiglione''), beneath the surrounding hills. Also to the south, an extended portico (with 666 arches and almost 4&nbsp;km long) leads out from the ''Viali'' (at ''Porta Saragozza'') up to the baroque Sanctuary of San Luca, which provides another iconic landmark.\\n\\n[[File:Bologna-Torre degli Asinelli-Dscn4724.jpg|thumb|A view of Bologna from above]]\\n===Around Piazza Maggiore===\\n\\nLarge pedestrian square located in the monumental center of the old part of the city, surrounded by a number of grand buildings.\\n* {{listing | type=see\\n| name=Basilica di San Petronio | alt= | url=http://www.basilicadisanpetronio.it | email=\\n| address=Piazza Maggiore | lat=44.492931 | long=11.343116 | directions=\\n| phone=+39 051 231 415 | tollfree=\\n| hours=M-Sa 09:30-12:30, 14:30-17:30; Su 14:30-17:00 | price=\\n| wikipedia=San Petronio Basilica | wikidata=Q810103\\n| lastedit=2016-04-08\\n| content=It had to be the largest church in the world and in the shape of a huge Latin cross, but was only completed the long arm and with the unfinished facade.

If you plan on spending the onset of the winter holidays in Bologna, you can complete your vacation with a visit to the '''Motorshow Bologna''' and to the museums that showcase the automobile masterpieces of Italy.\\n\\nAnd just nearby lies the three museums you must visit in order to do this. These are the Ducati Museum, the Lamborghini Museum, and the Ferrari Museum or Galleria Ferrari. To fully appreciate the '''Ducati Museum''' you can join guided tours by obtaining advanced reservations. The museum is open daily except on Sundays and holidays. To enter, you will need to join a tour, you can choose from the 11:00 or the 16:00 schedule. The tour of the museum and factory costs \\u20ac10. Next, you can make your way to the '''Lamborghini Museum''', which is in the area that connects Bologna with neighboring city Modena. It lies at about 21 miles from Bologna and can be easily driven to. The museum was established in 2001 and aims to celebrate one of the most expensive Italian cars in the world. To complete your unique museum-hopping, head over to '''Ferrari Museum''' or Galleria Ferrari. The museum is in Maranello, a town just outside Modena and around 55 km (34 miles) from Bologna. Although the museum is part of Ferrari\\u2019s headquarters, it has its own building separate from the Ferrari factory. Of the three museums in your itinerary, the Ferrari Museum is the oldest, dating back to 1990. The museum spans an amazing 2,500 m\\u00b2 and is divided into four sections, namely the Formula One collection, the special exhibits, the technological innovation exhibit, and the photo exhibits.\\n\\nThe '''Formula One''' collection displays the extraordinary race cars that have played a monumental role in making Ferrari the most famous automobile maker in the world. One of the most remarkable cars is the first Ferrari 125 S that was built in 1947 and won a race in the same year. And to give you a glimpse of what F1I racing is all about, you can check out the Fiorano test track next to the museum where you might even see a Ferrari racing past.\\n\\n'''[http://www.autodromoimola.it/ Imola Circuit]''' (''Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari'') is a motor-racing circuit in the town of [[Imola#Do |Imola]]. It hosts [[Formula One]] and other races.\\n\\n=== Music ===\\nBologna is an Italian hub for rock, electronic and alternative music.

In the past, these have included especially Italian and French film, animation shorts from Annecy, archive footage of Bologna (e.g. of its liberation by British and American troops) and modern classics such as ''The Third Man'', ''Raging Bull'', ''Apocalypse Now'' and ''The Pianist''. In November there's a chocolate festival in Piazza Maggiore or Piazza XX Settembre.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n[[File:Tortellini in Bologna.jpg|thumb|Hand-made tortellini for sale in Bologna]]\\nThe key to shopping in Italy is to look in every little shop as you walk around, paying attention to price tags. Please take note that the hours listed usually specify a closure in the afternoons. There is no one place to get the perfect pair of shoes or the perfect ties or the perfect anything: you have to look all over, but this is half the fun. If you can't find what you want at the price you want to pay for it, keep looking, chances are you will find something somewhere else that will work perfectly.\\n\\nDon't miss the chance to buy local food, such as hand-made pastas, gorgeous cheeses and sausages, from any of the hundreds of small vendors and shops to be found in the city. At least half the experience of visiting Bologna is the gastronomic pleasure! The Quadrilatero district, the old market immediately to the west of Piazza Maggiore, is a good place to buy food, or sit down to eat and drink something. Quadrilatero consists of several streets and alleys lined with small stores and eating spots.\\n\\nIf you have money to spend (a lot perhaps...) you have to go in 'Galleria Cavour', near 'Via Farini' with a lot of chic high fashion shops and trendy outlets (Armani, Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Versace, etc.)\\n\\nAnother \\\"shop street\\\" is \\\"via San Felice\\\" near \\\"via Ugo Bassi\\\" with a lot of small shops that made artigianal dresses (sugarbabe), artshop (elzapoppin), art galleries and (as usual) shoes and dresses shop.\\n\\n* {{buy\\n| name=Eataly Bologna | url=http://www.eataly.net/it_en/shops/bologna/ | email=\\n| address=Via Degli Orefici, 19 | lat=44.493848 | long=11.344998 | directions=\\n| phone=+39 051 0952820 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= M-Sa 08:00-23:30, Su 10:00-23:30 | price=\\n| content=Eataly is a gourmet grocery store associated with [[w:Slow (movement)|''Slow movement'']].

Anyone who enjoys shopping or window-shopping for food-related products is likely to enjoy walking through.\\n}}\\n\\n==Eat==\\nThere are many choices for where to eat, as Bologna is generally considered to be the gastronomic centre of Italy.\\n[[File:MetCheese.jpg|thumb|A savory plate of traditional Bologna Salumi e Formaggi (cured meat and cheese)]]\\n[[File:03 Via Guglielmo Marconi, Bologna, Italy - \\u30dc\\u30ed\\u30fc\\u30cb\\u30e3.jpg|thumb|right|Night life and outdoor cafe tables at Via Guglielmo Marconi]]\\nFor local dishes, try: '''Da Gianni''' in ''Via Clavature'', '''Mariposa''' in ''Via Bertiera'' or '''Meloncello''' in ''Via Sargozza''.\\n\\nFor good service, good wine list and fine food at a price try '''Camminetto D'Oro''' in ''Via de Falegnami'' or '''Cesarina''' in ''Piazza Santo Stefano''.\\n\\nFor more contemporary stylish dining try the excellent and good value '''Casa Monica''' in ''Via San Felice''.\\n\\n''Via del Pratello'' has lots of bars and restaurants/osterie for young people. There's lots to choose from here. Walk past, look at the menus. It is located towards the middle of the 'western' part of the map. '''Fantoni''', with its checkered red and white table clothes and scribbled menus, is much frequented by students and serves fantastic fish secondi and an excellent rag\\u00f9. ''Via Mascarella/Largo Respighi'' is another zone with a lot of osterie.\\n\\nAlthough many foreigners have heard of spaghetti bolognais or bolognese, the dish is not a traditional dish of Bologna but a French (and subsequently British and American) adaptation, with non-Italian versions of bolognaise sauce bearing little resemblance to the local ''rag\\u00f9 alla bolognese''. The closest local dish to spaghetti bolognese is ''tagliatelle al rag\\u00f9'', which uses a different type of pasta from spaghetti. Besides tagliatelle, ''rag\\u00f9 alla bolognese'' is also used to make ''lasagne alla bolognese''.\\n\\nLikewise, while bologna sausage descends from ''mortadella Bologna'', the original is flecked with cubes of pork fat and often flavored with pepper.\\n\\n===Budget===\\n\\n====Central area====\\n\\n*{{eat\\n| name=Osteria del Sole | alt= | url=http://www.osteriadelsole.it/ | email=\\n| address=Vicolo Ranocchi, 1/d\\n| lat=44.49402 | long=11.34446 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=M-Sa 10:30-21:30 | price=\\n| lastedit=2022-08-01\\n| content=If you feel like picnicking on some of the cold cuts (''salumi''), cheeses and other fresh foods on display in the delicatessens and market stalls off ''Piazza Maggiore'', then ''Osteria del Sole'' at a tiny street could be a perfect venue.

One may that due to its heavily industrialized cityscape it can be found not as interesting compared to other major cities of Lombardy.\\n\\n[[File:Bs due scura 2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Brescia Metro is not only convenient and modern but also quite spectacular]]\\nYes, Brescia is famous for its industrial past and for its role as a major manufacturing centre: numerous factories produce weapons (including the famous Beretta pistols) and cutlery/kitchen accessories.  This industry has brought the city tremendous wealth and prestige since the 1960s, to the point that an entire second city\\u2014the imaginatively named Brescia 2--has sprung up on the south side of the city's original boundaries.\\n\\nAlso, vintage car aficionados flock to Brescia to witness the start and final of the ''Mille Miglia'' race, and wine lovers appreciate the local fine ''Franciacorta'' wines.\\n\\nBrescia, however, also has another face, having been founded over three millenniums ago in the times of the [[Roman Empire]], of which several remains can be found, and it remained an important city throughout the early Middle Ages, with the local monastic complex earning a place on the [[UNESCO World Heritage#Italy|UNESCO World Heritage]] list (see ''[[Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568\\u2013774 A.D.)]]'').  \\n\\nBrescia is a city rich in history, flavours and artistic monuments of great importance. Visiting this city is like taking a dip in the most ancient history. In addition, Brescia is a city that offers a lot from a naturalistic point of view despite its large industrial size. The most popular excursions and trips among visitors who are passionate about outdoor sports are the itineraries that lead to the eastern hills, Mount Maddalena and Cidneo, where the first inhabited centre developed. Alongside the artistic part of the city, rich in museums and legends, there is a hyper-modern part consisting of the subway that allows the visitor to pass through the territory of the city from one side to the other. An easy itinerary to do on foot in the historic centre is the \\\"street of museums\\\" in the historic centre, which includes most of the most important museums in the province. \\n\\n===Tourist information===\\n* {{listing | type=listing\\n| name=IAT | alt=Tourist Information Office | url=https://www.provincia.brescia.it/turista/turismo-e-cultura/uffici-informazione-accoglienza-turistica-tourist-offices | email=iat.brescia@provincia.brescia.it\\n| address=Piazza del Foro, 6 | lat=45.5392859 | long=10.2254927 | directions=Palazzo Martinengo\\n| phone=+39 030 374 9916 | tollfree=\\n| hours=Daily 10:00 - 18:00 | price=\\n| lastedit=2015-09-04\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{mapframe|zoom=auto}}\\n{{mapshape}}\\n\\n===By plane===\\n* {{listing | type=go\\n| name=Aeroporto di Brescia-Montichiari | alt={{IATA|VBS}} | url=http://www.aeroportobrescia.it/en/passeggeri_t5 | email=\\n| address= | lat=45.423907 | long=10.329294 | directions=20&nbsp;km from the city centre in Montichiari\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Brescia Airport | image=Aeroporto di Brescia-Montichiari.JPG | wikidata=Q1430989\\n| lastedit=2016-05-06\\n| content=A small airport served by charter flights.\\n}}\\n\\nThe other close airports are:\\n*'''[[Bergamo#Bergamo Orio al Serio International Airport| Bergamo Airport]]''' (aka ''Milan Orio al Serio'', 50&nbsp;km away, and is served by low-fare flights from all over Europe)\\n*'''[[Verona#Aeroporto Valerio Catullo|Verona Airport]]''' (50&nbsp;km away)\\n*'''[[Milan#Linate Airpot|Milano Linate]]''' (100&nbsp;km away)\\n*'''[[Milano Malpensa Airport]]''' (150&nbsp;km away).\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:Brescia staz ferr lato strada.JPG|thumb|Railway station]]\\nYou can reach Brescia by any train from the expensive ''Eurostars'' to the cheap and slow ''regionale'' commuter trains.\\n* {{listing|type=go\\n| name=Stazione di Brescia | alt=Railway station | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=45.532207 | long=10.213927 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2019-03-12\\n| content=It is about an hour from [[Milan]] (costing \\u20ac7.30 on the Regionale), and other cities including [[Bergamo]], [[Verona]] and [[Venice]] are within an hour or two.\\n}}\\n\\n===By bus===\\nThere are 2 bus hubs located near the railway station.\\n\\n* {{listing|type=go\\n| name=Autostazione SAIA | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=Via Solferino 6/D | lat=45.533052 | long=10.214555 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2016-05-06\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing|type=go\\n| name=Autostazione SIA | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=Viale Stazione, 14 | lat=45.533307 | long=10.211579 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2016-05-06\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===By car===\\nBrescia is reachable using the following motorway:\\n* [[File:Autostrada A4 Italia.svg|20px|motorway A4]]([[Torino]]-[[Trieste]]), exits: ''Brescia Ovest'', ''Brescia Centro'', ''Brescia Est'';\\n* [[File:Autostrada A21 Italia.svg|20px|motorway A21]]([[Torino]]-Brescia), exits: ''Brescia Centro'', ''Brescia Sud'';\\n* [[File:Autostrada A35 Italia.svg|20px|motorway A35-BreBeMi]] (Brescia-[[Bergamo]]-[[Milano]]) .\\nThe ring roads around Brescia are: the Tangenziale Sud, or Tangenziale Alcide De Gasperi, which goes around the town to the south, and the Tangenziale Ovest is a municipal road, classified as urban, which goes around the town to the west.\\n\\nBrescia is crossed by the following state and regional roads:\\n\\n* \\u00a0\\u00a0 State road 11 Padana Superiore\\n* \\u00a0\\u00a0 State road 510 Sebina Orientale\\n* \\u00a0\\u00a0 State road 235 of Orzinuovi\\n* \\u00a0\\u00a0 State road 45 bis Gardesana Occidentale\\n* \\u00a0\\u00a0 State road 345 of the Three Valleys\\n\\nDirections from the most famous cities in Northern Italy:\\n\\n* From Milan head towards A51 passing the junction for Tangenziale Est / Lecco / Tangenziale Nord / Turin / Venice / Usmate Velate / Malpensa Airport.

There are 17 stations, of which eight in a deep tunnel, five in a covered trench, two located along the surface section and two on the viaduct.\\n\\nThe frequency varies from 4 minutes during peak hours to 10 minutes at night or less crowded.

The Brescia Castle (also called \\\"Falcone d\\u2019Italia\\\") is a fortress built in the Middle Ages and perched on the Cidneo hill, close to the historic centre of the city. It dominates the Cidneo hill, facing the historic centre. The Cidneo is a block of Liassic rock (M\\u00e9dole domeriano). The castle is surrounded by a green quadrilateral covered with numerous trees and surrounded by defensive walls. The heart of the castle is the keep, built in the first half of the 14th century. The building has a rectangular base with crenellated walls. It houses the Luigi Marzoli Weapons Museum where you can see some unique pieces of artillery from the 15th and 16th centuries. The building was erected on the foundations and the remains of a temple Roman from the 1st century AD. To reach the keep you have to cross a drawbridge at the Torre dei Prigionieri. The castle complex includes several other towers: the Torre dei Francesi, so named because, after the explosion of a powder keg, it was rebuilt by the French who from 1509 to 1516 took the Venetian dominion over the city from the Venetians; the Torre Mirabella, cylindrical in shape, is commonly believed to be the only building from the municipal age; the Torre di Mezzo and Torre Coltrina attributed to the engineer Jacopo Coltrino from whom it takes its name, is in the northern area of \\u200b\\u200bthe castle; cylindrical in shape with a high truncated conical base, it is arranged on two levels and is connected to a gunboat covered with a barrel vault. Inside the castle complex we also find the oil warehouses, dating back to the Roman period, the Piccolo and Grande Miglio, buildings erected between 1597 and 1598 and used as grain stores. The Grande Miglio is now home to the Civic Museum of the Risorgimento.\\n}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=Chiesa di San Giuseppe | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= Vicolo San Giuseppe, 5| lat=45.540897 | long=10.220538 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2015-09-04\\n| content=16th-century church, inside, there is one of the oldest organs in the world.\\n}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=Broletto | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=Piazza Paolo VI | lat=45.5392483 | long=10.2217269 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2015-09-04\\n| content=12th-century Town Hall\\n}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=Duomo Vecchio | alt=La Rotonda | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=45.5382 | long=10.2217 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=The unique pre-renaissance church has a massive stone dome and 12th century crucifixes.\\n}}\\n\\n[[File:Cathedral of Brescia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cathedral of Brescia]]\\n* {{see\\n|name = Duomo Nuovo\\n|alt=New Cathedral\\n|lat=45.5386|long=10.2218\\n|content=The city cathedral, built 150 years ago, with the third largest dome in Italy.

Try the amazing spiedo (in winter only) roasted larks and pork meat cooked for 6\\u20137 hours in oven with butter and flavours or on grill. It's very typically Bresciano!\\n\\nThe Brescia cuisine is based on dishes with strong and decisive flavors that fully reflect the territory and the products and raw materials come exclusively from the hilly areas, from the mountain areas and from the lake areas.\\n\\nLet's see what are some of the best typical dishes of Brescia that you absolutely must not give up:\\n\\n* Casoncelli alla Bresciana\\n* Risotto alla Pitocca\\n* Beef in oil\\n* Caicc (Ravioli di Breno)\\n* Local cured meats and cheeses\\n* polenta taragna\\n* Bresciana-style rabbit\\n* Stuffed pigeon\\n* Brescia spit\\n* Whitefish alla Bresciana\\n* Fried lake fish\\nThe traditional cuisine of Brescia reflects the territory of its province; vast hilly, mountainous, wooded and lake areas, in fact the gastronomy of Brescia is marked by tastes and dishes where land and lake are combined. Some of these typical products are oil (produced in the area of \\u200b\\u200bLake Garda), Bagoss (a hard mountain cheese, extremely tasty), Franciacorta wines (especially sparkling wines produced exclusively in the Brescia area which have surpassed even those French in many international competitions).\\n\\nWhat to eat in Brescia to taste the typical local cuisine? The typical Brescian dishes you should try during your stay in Brescia are:\\n* '''The spit''' which is the main dish of Brescia, typically originating from Valtrompia, consisting of a mixture of pieces of meat (pork, beef and birds) strung on raffia and simmered for many hours. During slow cooking, the meat is continually sprinkled with a butter and sage-based sauce, making it moist and tastier, while the external part of the bites of meat, with this particular cooking, remain crunchy.\\n* '''Beef with Rovato oil''': The name of this beef in oil refers to a town in the province of Brescia, precisely Rovato. The main thing to prepare an excellent beef with oil is the quality of the meat which must be a young cut, low in fat and low in fibrous. The piece of poached meat is filled, by means of pockets engraved on the 4 sides, with chopped celery, carrots and onions; it is then floured and saut\\u00e9ed in oil blended with white wine. The meat thus obtained is then cooked in abundant water, so that all the ingredients come to form a thick sauce.\\n* '''Brescian-style rabbit''': Composed of pieces of rabbit cooked in the oven and softened by butter, lard and Lugana wine; it is usually accompanied by polenta and potatoes.\\n* '''Polenta taragna''': It is assumed that the name \\u201ctaragna\\u201d derives from the \\u201ctar\\u00e8l\\u201d, a stick needed to continuously stir the polenta, preventing it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Polenta taragna is prepared with selected wholemeal corn flours, such as Quarantino corn flour and buckwheat corn, all types of corn found in the Brescia area.\\n* '''Casoncelli in Brescia style''': Casoncelli are made from triangular or rectangular egg pasta, classically filled with cooked ham, Parmesan cheese and nutmeg. The variations of the filling are however many: with raw ham, with pumpkin, with minced meat.\\n* '''Bossol\\u00e0''': It is the typical dessert of traditional Brescia cuisine, consisting of a very tall and soft donut, covered with powdered sugar. It is usually served accompanied by custard, chocolate or mascarpone.\\n*'''Brescia biscuits''': The appearance is that of a simple biscuit, but when you taste it you will understand that they are truly special. The ingredients are the classic biscuit ingredients: flour, milk, sugar, butter, honey, vanilla and Marsala. But the peculiarity of the Brescia biscuits is given by the fact that they are cooked twice: the first time they are baked to make the mass of dough cook, the second time to brown the surface. It is the dexterity of the skilled pastry chefs of Brescia that make the biscuits truly special, products absolutely to be tasted.\\n\\nAs with most of Lombard cuisine, Brescian cooking features more beef and butter and more hearty, German-style dishes than the rest of Italy.\\nExcellent pizzerias abound, including Al Teatro (by the theater and portici on the corner of Via Giuseppe Mazzini and Via Giuseppe Zanardelli) and the South-American styled Tempio Inca Pizzeria (Piazzale Arnaldo).\\n\\nAuthentic Brescian osterias and trattorias are common on the north side of the city center, but you will find that the best are out of the way and, purposefully, rather hard to find.  Try to find the Contrada Santa Chiara, a dark side street parallel to Via San Faustino, where just off Via Dei Musei (close to the Roman Ruins and Santa Giulia), you'll find several highly authentic and inexpensive osterias including Osteria al Bianchi.\\n\\nCafe culture is just as prominent here as elsewhere, and there are several great coffee and aperitivo spots.  Try the Due Stelle on Via San Faustino (also a great restaurant), or any of several cafe/restaurants just north of the Duomos between the Piazza Paulo VI and Via Dei Musei, which feature drinks and unlimited gourmet aperitivo buffets for under 6 Euro.\\n\\n* {{eat\\n| name=Amarcord Artisan Piada Restaurant | alt= | url=http://www.amarcordpiadineria.it/ | email=\\n| address=Via Fratelli Ugoni 16a | lat=45.539429 | long=10.210085 | directions=\\n| phone=+39 030 42216 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=Budget\\n| lastedit=2017-11-15\\n| content=Fast food.

The broad fertile plain of the River Po was obviously worth seizing, so they built ''Via Aemilia'' as a great trunk road, with a line of colonies, fortresses and towns along it. Imola was one of these towns, established by the dictator Sulla around 82 BC. Other despots also thought it worth seizing, so Imola was at various times held by the Lombards, the Pope, and the warring Italian great families. It particularly enjoyed patronage in the 15th century and again in the 18th, with many fine buildings created or embellished. The town's main trades were agriculture and ceramics, like nearby Faenza. \\n\\nImola in 2017 had a population just under 70,000; it's a commuter town and has excellent transport along the valley, so you could use it as a base to explore everywhere from Bologna to Ravenna. But what made its name famous was the racing circuit, set up in 1953 as the home circuit of the Ferrari racing team. \\n\\n== Get in ==\\n[[File:Imola Rocca Sforzesca l'ora blu.jpg|thumb|300px|Rocca Sforzesca]]\\nBy air, Bologna Airport ({{IATA|BLQ}}) is closest and has budget flights by Ryanair.

Whether outlying towns such as [[Gilroy]] and [[Santa Cruz (California)|Santa Cruz]] are part of the Bay Area or nearby regions like the Central Valley and Central Coast will depend on who you ask.\\n\\nPerhaps the unifying feature of the Bay Area, besides the hilly seaside landscapes, is its acceptance of unconventional lifestyles. The undercurrent of nonconformism brought by gold rush prospectors has allowed the region to give rise to the Summer of Love, the Black Panther Party, the \\\"Gay Capital of America\\\", and the tech hub of Silicon Valley. It remains to be seen what will arise next in this offbeat and eclectic region that has been reinventing itself continuously for well over a century.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n\\nTemperate in summer and mild in the winter, the Bay Area is an excellent place to visit year-round. The weather in the Bay Area is affected by '''microclimates''': parts of the East Bay or the North Bay can be as much as 25\\u00b0F (15\\u00b0C) warmer than downtown San Francisco or the Golden Gate bridge. Crossing a hill or going through a tunnel can take you from hot sunshine to cool fog or back again. Generally the closer to the ocean one goes the cooler it is. Dress in layers accordingly.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[File:California Wikivoyage locator maps - San Francisco Bay Area.png|150px|thumb|The location of the Bay Area in California]]\\n===By plane===\\nThere are three major airports in the San Francisco Bay Area: '''[[San Francisco International Airport]]''' ({{IATA|SFO}}, located about 10 miles / 15 km south of the city) is the largest, a major international airport with numerous passenger amenities; '''[[Oakland#By plane|Oakland International Airport]]''' ({{IATA|OAK}}), in the [[East Bay (Bay Area)|East Bay]] is smaller and serves destinations in the U.S. and Mexico; and '''[[San Jose (California)#By plane|Mineta San Jose International Airport]]''' ({{IATA|SJC}}), in Silicon Valley) serves the U.S. and only a few international flights to Mexico and Japan. All are served by discount airlines such as Southwest, though OAK and SJC tend to have more low-cost flights than SFO. All three airports may be reached by inexpensive public transit (SFO and OAK are both served by the regional BART system), though SJC is the most inconvenient to San Francisco (SJC is served by San Jose's VTA Light Rail and the regional Caltrain line). Private pilots should consider Oakland ({{IATA|OAK}}) rather than SFO, as the separate general aviation field there is more accommodating to light aircraft. While SFO is the largest and serves the most international connections, it is also the most congested and delays due to that as well as fog are not unheard of.\\n\\n===By train===\\n'''[[Amtrak]]''', +1-800-872-7245, serves the Bay Area with long-distance and intercity trains. Two long distance trains, the '''[[California Zephyr]]''' to [[Chicago]] and the '''[http://www.amtrak.com/coast-starlight-train Coast Starlight]''' between [[Seattle]] and [[Los Angeles]], serve the Bay Area with stations in [[Martinez (California)|Martinez]] and [[Emeryville]], with the Coast Starlight also stopping at Oakland's Jack London Square Station and San Jose.  From Emeryville, passengers may take an '''[https://amtrakcalifornia.com/ Amtrak California]''' Thruway bus over the Bay Bridge to San Francisco's Amtrak stop at 101 The Embarcadero (near the Ferry Building) and usually several other downtown destinations (note that Amtrak passengers are not subjected to any extra charge for the bus).\\n\\nTwo shorter distance [[Amtrak]] routes also serve the Bay Area: The '''[http://www.capitolcorridor.org/ Capitol Corridor]''' runs 16 times daily (11 on weekends and holidays) between [[Sacramento]] and Emeryville, with some trains also serving San Jose, with connections to Caltrain in San Jose, Amtrak bus at Emeryville, and BART at Richmond or the Oakland Coliseum station. Additionally, the '''[http://www.amtrak.com/san-joaquin-train San Joaquin]''' runs 4 times daily between [[Bakersfield]], [[Stockton (California)|Stockton]] and Emeryville. Travelers on the San Joaquin can connect to Amtrak bus at Emeryville or the BART at the Richmond station.\\n\\n===By car===\\nFrom the east, the entrance to the Bay Area is superhighway '''Interstate 80''', which wends its way all the way from [[New York City|New York]] several thousand miles to pass through [[Lake Tahoe]] and [[Sacramento]] and end up in San Francisco.\\n\\nFrom the south, the lovely '''Highway 101''' runs from [[Southern California]] through the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] to Silicon Valley and up the [[Peninsula (Bay Area)|Peninsula]] to San Francisco. Some people prefer '''Highway 5''', which travels more directly through the [[San Joaquin Valley]] to highway '''580''' and then into the Bay Area through the [[East Bay (Bay Area)|East Bay]].\\n\\nFrom the [[North Coast (California)|North Coast]] or the [[Pacific Northwest]], the story is similar. Coastal highway 101 is more scenic, while highway 5 is efficient but somewhat boring. [[Interstate 5]] intersects interstate 80 in Sacramento, however, when coming from the north, Interstate 505 can be used to bypass Sacramento and get to the Bay Area quicker.\\n\\nParking rates in San Francisco can go up to around $30.  You can park at BART parking lots:\\nFor example:\\nPark in Colma parking garage $2 all day, free weekends and round trip BART from Colma to Moscone Center would\\ncost $6.50 for one person, so two people could park and train for $15 as opposed to $25 for all day parking at the center.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nMost routes connect the Bay Area to Los Angeles via Interstate 5.  Other routes go to Sacramento, Redding, and San Luis Obispo.\\n\\n=== By boat ===\\nSome cruise lines along the Pacific Coast stop in San Francisco, but only for the day.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n{{see also|Bay Area public transit}}\\n[[File:Golden Gate Bridge at Purple sunset.jpg|thumb|The Golden Gate Bridge]]\\n\\n===By car===\\nThe Bay Area is well served by a '''network of freeways'''. Highways 280 and 101 run up the Peninsula from the Silicon Valley to San Francisco, and 101 continues into Marin County across the Golden Gate Bridge. Highways 880 (also called the Nimitz Freeway) and 580 run the length of the East Bay, and Highway 24 runs out to Contra Costa County. All major freeways, particularly those going through San Francisco and Oakland, suffer from severe congestion at commute times.  Interstate 280 and the South Bay freeways and expressways tend to be less congested than the Peninsula and East Bay freeways.\\n\\nFor a slower but vastly more scenic route, the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] (also known as PCH and Highway 1) runs along the coast.  In many places this route may not be appropriate for those prone to car sickness or fear of heights, but for all others it provides an unforgettable vista over the Pacific Coast.\\n\\nNote that many Bay Area freeways tend to have dense traffic at ''any'' time of day or the evening, ''any'' day of the week (even Sundays), and you will be lucky if traffic is actually moving at the speed limit (rather than far below it). This is particularly true of the Eastshore Freeway in Berkeley and the James Lick Skyway in San Francisco.  Other freeways, such as Interstate 280 on the Peninsula, are congested only during rush hours on weekdays and are relatively easy to drive at all other times.  You can get traffic reports 24 hours a day from several radio stations, most notably KCBS (740 AM and 106.9 FM) which has traffic and weather reports every ten minutes on the eights (:08, :18, :28, :38, :48, and :58).\\n\\nThere is a proportion of \\\"hurried\\\" drivers that will zig-zag between cars at high speeds. There are also fast successions of freeway interchanges; a misunderstanding may land you on the wrong freeway, even on a bridge you do not intend to take. Interchanges are signposted with road numbers and compass directions, but even these may be confusing: the same stretch of road may carry several numbers and opposite compass directions between these numbers. Read a map carefully before driving or have a passenger watch for directions.\\n\\nNote that since tolls are charged only one-way on the toll bridges, you should plan road trips to minimize the number of times you traverse bridges in the toll direction.\\n[[File:SF Bay Rail Transit.svg|thumb|280x280px|Map of San Francisco railways ]]\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:BART web map effective September 2023.png|thumb|280px|Map of the BART system]]\\n'''[http://www.bart.gov Bay Area Rapid Transit]''' (BART) is an extensive regional metro system that connects San Francisco to the East Bay as well as parts of the Peninsula, the eastern half of Silicon Valley, and the San Francisco and Oakland airports. BART is also useful for getting around within SF and Oakland. Fares vary by distance traveled, but usually run about $2\\u20135 one way. Pay by [[Clipper card]], which can be purchased from vending machines at any station. You will need to tap the card on the barriers when entering and exiting the system. Clipper cards hold a balance, deducting the appropriate price for each trip. Note that the BART vending machines accept any credit card only twice within any 24 hour period.  Trains run about every 10\\u201320 minutes starting around 6AM and closing just after midnight.\\n\\n[[File:Caltrain map.svg|thumb|280px|Map of Caltrain system]]\\n'''[http://www.caltrain.com Caltrain]''' is a commuter train system running along the Peninsula between San Francisco, San Jose and [[Gilroy (California)|Gilroy]]. Ticket prices vary by the distance between stations, but usually run around $3-6 one way. Trains run about once every half hour, on average, once an hour late evenings and weekends, with several more trains running during commute hours. This train service is not particularly fast; however, in a move to improve speed, many trains during commute hours run express or semi-express service, so they do not stop at all stations. Tickets must be purchased before boarding the train from ticket vending machines at any of the stations or from ticket clerks at staffed stations. Tickets are checked on the trains and anyone found without a ticket is liable to a substantial fine. Cyclists should use the designated car at the northern end of the train, and be aware that bike space is often limited during commute hours.\\n\\nA full list of Bay Area public transportation agencies, as well as a refreshingly useful trip planner, can be found at the Metropolitan Transportation Commissions's web site '''[http://511.org 511.org]'''.  This planner is more useful than Google maps, as the Bay Area has so many transit agencies navigating them is a chore and not all of them are on Google.  In some cases this could save you money as an express bus could get you to the same place and be just as fast as BART for half the price!\\n\\n===By boat===\\nPassenger ferries link many of the cities in the Bay Area (particularly the North Bay), and can be a very scenic way to get around, with splendid views of the San Francisco skyline, Alcatraz, and much of the lush hillside scenery. In San Francisco, the ferries dock at one or both of the city's two piers at Fisherman's Wharf and the Ferry Building, the later of which is a very short walk from extensive BART and Muni services. In Oakland, the ferry terminal is at the foot of Clay Street in Jack London Square. There are three operators of ferry services in the Bay Area:\\n\\n* '''[https://www.goldengate.org/ferry/ Golden Gate Ferry]''', +1 415 455-2000. Runs regular service between San Francisco and [[Larkspur]] and [[Sausalito]].\\n* '''[http://www.blueandgoldfleet.com Blue and Gold Fleet]''', +1 415 705-8200. Runs ferries between San Francisco and Sausalito, [[Alameda]]/[[Oakland]], [[Tiburon]], and [[San Francisco/Fisherman's Wharf#Bay cruises and ferries|Angel Island]], with additional service to Angel Island from Alameda/Oakland.\\n*'''[http://sanfranciscobayferry.com/ San Francisco Bay Ferry]''', +1-877-705-8291. Runs ferries between San Francisco and [[Alameda]], Harbor Bay (in Alameda), [[Oakland]], and [[Vallejo]], as well as service between [[South San Francisco]] and Alameda/Oakland.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nThere are many transit agencies in the Bay Area.  Most places can be reached by local bus.  Longer distances should be travelled with regional rail like Caltrain or BART to decrease travel time.\\n\\n=== By bicycle ===\\n\\nThis is a reasonably popular area for biking, though be warned that much of it is hilly. [https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels Bay Wheels] is a local bikeshare network offering both regular bicycles and ebikes, with stations in San Francisco, the East Bay, and San Jose.\\n\\n==See==\\n[[File:Alcatraz 2021.jpg|thumb|The island prison of [[Alcatraz]]]]\\nThe Bay Area has a multifaceted history, with all sorts of people who have made their homes here: Miwok and Ohlone native Americans, [[El Camino Real|Spanish missionaries]], [[Fort Ross|Russian colonists]], gold miners, the [[San Francisco/Chinatown|first Chinese community]] in North America, bohemians, beatniks, hippies, naval sailors... All of these groups have left their marks on the region, and that's before even mentioning some of the most interesting and distinctive historic sites, like the notorious prison on [[Alcatraz|Alcatraz Island]], the roots of modern environmentalism in [[Martinez (California)|Martinez]], and the eccentric Winchester Mystery House in [[San Jose (California)|San Jose]]. Nor is the region's distinctiveness limited to the past. [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland]] continue to be '''fascinating patchworks of cultural diversity''', [[Berkeley]] is a hotbed of left-wing political activism, and [[Silicon Valley]] is one of the world's major centers of innovation.\\n\\n'''World-class museums''' include the Exploratorium in [[San Francisco/Fisherman's Wharf|Fisherman's Wharf]], the de Young Museum of fine arts and nearby California Academy of Sciences in [[Golden Gate Park]], and the Lawrence Hall of Science in [[Berkeley]]. Many towns have local history museums or art galleries, and there are lots of niche museums in the area as well (like the Computer History Museum in [[Mountain View (California)|Mountain View]], the Charles M. Schulz Museum in [[Santa Rosa (California)|Santa Rosa]], the Pacific Pinball Museum in [[Alameda]], and the Aftel Archive of Curious Scents in [[Berkeley]]).\\n\\n'''Military history''' buffs will find a number of attractions reflecting the Bay Area's importance to the U.S. Navy in [[World War II]]. Former shipyards, ships, and museums can be toured in [[San Francisco/Fisherman's Wharf|Fisherman's Wharf]] and a few places in the [[East Bay]] ([[Alameda]], [[Martinez (California)|Martinez]], [[Oakland]], and [[Richmond (California)|Richmond]]).\\n\\n==Do==\\n[[File:Muir Woods National Monument (46966706055).jpg|thumb|Hiking in [[Muir Woods]]]]\\nRolling hills, dramatic cliffs, majestic redwoods, and foggy seas make the Bay Area a wonderful place to '''explore the outdoors'''. There are so many opportunities for hiking, biking, horseback riding, and sailing, you're unlikely to run out of nature to explore. Bicyclists from other parts of the United States will find that this region has a '''strong biking culture''', including urban and mountain biking. For hikers, a surprising number of trails are accessible by public transit (see the [https://hikingbytransit.com/ Hiking by Transit] website for an extensive map and specific routes). Swimming, surfing, and other beach activities are possible as well, but the water is too cold for them to be as popular here as they are in [[Socal]]. If you need equipment for outdoor activities, local chain [https://shop.sportsbasement.com/ Sports Basement] has about a dozen branches scattered around the Bay Area with reasonably-priced rentals, from bicycles and surfboards to tents and neck warmers.\\n\\nNature lovers visiting the region should not miss '''[[Point Reyes]]''' and '''[[Muir Woods]]''', both of which are unique and extraordinary nature preserves in [[Marin County]]. There are lots of beaches on the [[Peninsula (Bay Area)|Peninsula]], including some with great tidepools. [[Mount Diablo]] and [[Angel Island]] also merit mention, and almost anywhere in the Bay Area you can find lovely hills or beaches to enjoy nature and nice views.\\n\\nIn terms of '''wildlife''': deer, coyotes, lizards, banana slugs, sea lions, herons, vultures, and hawks are frequently seen. If you're lucky and venture off the most well-trodden paths, you might also spot bobcats, jackrabbits, whales, elephant seals, and beavers, among others.\\n\\nIn the Bay Area's cities, the region's multicultural heritage brings a wide variety of '''festivals and cultural celebrations''' ranging from mainstream (county fairs and holiday celebrations) to offbeat (races in costume and BDSM festivals). Lots of performing arts as well, centered in SF but certainly not just there.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nThe San Francisco Bay Area has a broad array of cuisines from various countries of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. While San Francisco probably has the widest variety of any of the Bay Area cities, locals will often tell you to go outside of San Francisco for the best of some cuisines, such as [[Fremont]] for Afghan or Indian or Pakistani, [[Burlingame]] for Jewish, [[Oakland]] for Ethiopian, or [[Redwood City]] for Mexican. The area has also developed its own array of localized Chinese cuisines; this started in San Francisco and has expanded throughout the Bay Area.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n[[File:NRCSCA00024 - California (555)(NRCS Photo Gallery).jpg|thumb|A hillside vineyard in [[Sonoma County]]]]\\nThe Bay Area is home to one of the world's premier [[wine]]-producing regions. The [[Napa Valley]] and neighboring [[Sonoma County]] draw huge numbers of visitors for wine tastings.\\n\\nIf wine isn't your thing, the area is home to a number of microbreweries and innumerable independent coffee shops. Peet's Coffee has now expanded across the U.S., but it started out and still has its strongest presence in the Bay Area.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n\\nHousing in the Bay Area is notoriously expensive. San Francisco's housing crisis is among the worst in the country, and '''lodging is expensive''' for visitors as well as residents. Unfortunately, lower prices are sometimes a sign of an inconvenient location or a rougher neighborhood (some of San Francisco's cheapest options are in the [[San Francisco/Civic Center-Tenderloin|Tenderloin]]).\\n==Stay safe==\\n[[File:Bobcat - Flickr - Becky Matsubara.jpg|thumb|Bobcats, like this one in Sobrante Ridge preserve near [[Richmond (California)|Richmond]], might be a danger to unattended pets but are unlikely to attack an adult human.]]\\n===Crime===\\nWith a few notable exceptions, parts of the Bay Area of interest to tourists are as safe as any other major North American city.  However, care should be taken in a few areas, when going \\\"off the beaten path\\\" or when traveling through unfamiliar residential areas.  While locals (and those from elsewhere in California) will generally be able to recognize poorer or high crime areas even when unfamiliar with the specific area, the signs of dangerous areas and slums are not always the same as in other American cities, let alone those abroad.\\n\\nCertain parts of the Bay Area are plagued by high crime rates.  The very worst areas are primarily residential/industrial and not much interest to tourists or travelers - these include the Southeastern section of San Francisco (Bayview-Hunter's Point, Sunnydale, Visitation Valley), East Palo Alto, West Oakland and much of East Oakland, some parts of Hayward and San Leandro, Bay Point, San Pablo, Central Richmond, the East parts of Redwood City and San Jose, and Vallejo.\\n\\nHowever, other high-crime parts of the Bay Area are either in tourist areas or directly adjacent to them.  ''These are generally safe if you stick to high-traffic commercial/through streets even at night, but care should be taken if you park on or detour through side streets, especially at night.''  These areas include\\n* San Francisco's Mission District, SOMA (South of Market), the Tenderloin/Civic Center, and the Western Addition in San Francisco.\\n* Oakland downtown and around Jack London Square.\\n* San Jose downtown\\n* Berkeley around the University of California Campus.\\n\\nEven outside of \\\"dangerous\\\" areas, within the major cities (San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and other developed parts of the East Bay) keep aware of your surroundings and use the same common sense as in any major urban area.\\n\\nCertain heavily-Latino neighborhoods, including the Mission District in San Francisco and many poorer parts of San Jose (such as Alum Rock) and the East Bay have a high degree of gang violence. While this will not be such an issue in major shopping centers or on busy commercial streets, especially if venturing outside these areas especially into residential or industrial areas, '''men should be careful to avoid wearing red or blue shirts as these are associated with Norteno and Sureno gang members.'''\\n\\nThere are also rough neighborhoods in many of the suburbs throughout the Bay Area: these include but are not limited to the cities of El Cerrito, Pittsburg, Antioch, Albany, El Sobrante, Martinez, Concord, Rodeo, Crockett, South San Francisco, Daly City, Union City, San Rafael, Fairfield, Vacaville, Suisun City, Napa, and Santa Rosa. If in doubt, ask a local if the area is safe.\\n\\n===Wildlife===\\n'''Rattlesnakes''' and '''black widow spiders''' live in the area, but they are shy and won't bite unless they feel threatened. If you see one, give it a wide berth, and if bitten, seek immediate medical attention.\\n\\n'''Coyotes''' and '''bobcats''' may be a threat to unattended babies or pets but are very unlikely to attack an adult. '''Mountain lion''' sightings are rare but possible; if you see one, make noise and try to look big to scare it away.\\n\\nBe careful to check for '''ticks''' after hiking in fields in the Bay Area.  There is a high rate of Lyme disease transmission in the Bay Area.  If a bulls' eye rash develops at the tick bite site, immediately seek medical help and treatment with antibiotics.\\n\\n==Go next==\\n* '''[[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]]''' \\u2013 The rugged section of coast south of the Bay Area that includes [[Monterey Bay]] and [[Big Sur]].\\n* '''[[San Joaquin Valley]]''' \\u2013 California's bread basket in the Central Valley.\\n* '''[[Sacramento Valley]]''' \\u2013 Home of the state capital.\\n* '''[[North Coast (California)|North Coast]]''' \\u2013 Located to the north of the Bay Area and home to massive redwoods and remote coastline.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{usableregion}}\\n{{isPartOf|California}}\\n{{geo|37.75|-122.283333|zoom=9}}\", \"{{pagebanner|San Luis Obispo Banner.jpg|caption=}}\\n'''[https://visitslo.com/ San Luis Obispo]''' is a city in [[San Luis Obispo County]] in the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] region of [[California]].\\n[[File:CerroSanLuis.jpg|thumb|400px|San Luis Obispo; Cerro San Luis (the hill for which the city is named) is on the right]]\\n==Understand==\\n\\nAbout half way between Los Angeles (200 miles / 320 km to the south) and San Francisco (230 miles / 370 km to the north), nine small but impressive volcanic peaks march down a valley of the Santa Lucia range to the Pacific Ocean. Nestled around two of these peaks is San Luis Obispo (\\\"SLO\\\", \\\"slow\\\", or \\\"San Luis\\\" to locals), a small college town that also is one of California's oldest communities. San Luis and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing; outstanding natural beauty; a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission; a small but thriving art gallery scene; and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.\\n\\n===Getting Oriented===\\nSan Luis Obispo is bounded by the imposing line of Cuesta Ridge to the northeast, the Irish Hills to the southwest, dramatic Bishop Peak to the northwest and Islay Hill to the southeast. The town clusters around the feet of the 1,000-foot (300-meter) Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white \\\"M\\\" (for Mission High School). Both locals and visitors frequently refer to Cerro San Luis as \\\"Madonna Mountain\\\" and a common misconception is that the \\\"M\\\" represents the surname \\\"Madonna;\\\" the famous Madonna Inn sits at the foot of the mountain and the city of San Luis Obispo negotiated public access to the peak with the Madonna family. Cal Poly sits hard against Cuesta Ridge (with its big white \\\"P\\\") and the downtown area runs from Cerro San Luis roughly toward campus around two parallel streets, Higuera and Monterey. Most restaurants, bars and shops are located on Higuera Street, nearer the Mission and Cerro San Luis; hotels are mostly located on Monterey Street, nearer the university but still within a mile (2 km) of the central downtown. A few restaurants are located in the charming Railroad District, about 5 blocks east of Higuera via Santa Rosa Street, near the train station and youth hostel.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Visitors Center | alt= | url=http://visitslo.com/ | email=visitorcenter@slochamber.org\\n| address=895 Monterey St. | lat= | long= | directions=in the same building as the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, on the corner of Morro and Monterey Streets in the heart of downtown\\n| phone=+1 805 781-2777 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Su-W 10AM-5PM; Th-Sa 10AM-7PM | price=\\n| content=The Visitor Center offers San Luis Obispo city maps, visitor guides, books about San Luis Obispo, and San Luis Obispo souvenirs.

The Santa Lucia mountains and the \\\"Nine Sisters\\\" offer many beautiful views of the city and the countryside. The two most popular hikes are Bishop Peak (no bikes allowed) and Cerro San Luis (multiple biking trails). If you're interested in other mountain biking trails around the county check out the list at [http://cccmb.org/ CCCMB], a volunteer organization that creates and maintains trails countywide.\\n*Visit '''Montana de Oro State Park'''. Take Los Osos Valley Road {{convert|10|miles}} west of town to a park named one of the state's best-kept secrets by the L.A. Times a few years back, and with good reason; it's filled with an abundance of hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails both along the ocean along the bluffs and inland into the coastal peaks; a dramatic cove with caves that kids and adults love; and miles of sandy beach and tidal pools. Trails range from casual ambles along the bluffs to the steep climbs up Valencia and Oats Peaks. Oats is the longer hike (about 5.5 miles / 9 km) but more rewarding, as it offers views of Valencia against the Pacific, as well as northward and eastward to the Nine Sisters and Cuesta Ridge; the trail also is less steep. A terrific nine-mile (14-km) loop can be made by continuing over the summit to the Coon Creek trail, then crossing back in front of the range along Rattlesnake Flats Trail. Take water! The \\\"Mountain of Gold\\\" also reigns as a popular out-and-back destination for the many road cyclists in the county, but cyclists ride westward early as strong winds pick up through Los Osos Valley in the early afternoon.\\n*Walk or bike to '''Poly Canyon'''. Located on the north east side of the Cal Poly campus. Poly Canyon is a hilly, open, grassy area where many Cal Poly engineering and architecture students have constructed senior projects. The road up can be reached by taking the main road towards the Poly Canyon Village housing complex and taking a right before the road dips down the hill on a smaller road with a gate that quickly turns to dirt/gravel. Public vehicles are not allowed to drive on it, though be alert for university vehicles travelling up and down on occasion and student runners/cyclists.\\n* Kayaks and other outdoor gear can be rented at reasonable prices by students and the public from '''Poly Escapes''' on the Cal Poly campus. Kayaking is possible in many places in the county, but the most exciting place to kayak is between Shell Beach and Pismo Beach where there are sea caves you can explore. There are guided tours of the so-called \\\"Dinosaur Caves\\\" available from several kayak rental shops in Pismo Beach.\\n*{{do\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Children's Museum | alt= | url=https://www.slocm.org/ | email=info@slocm.org\\n| address=1010 Nipomo Street | lat=35.278921 | long=-120.666103 | directions=\\n| phone=+1 805 544-5437 | tollfree=\\n| hours=Th-M 10AM-4PM | price=\\n| lastedit=2024-03-07\\n| content=Nipomo and Monterey.

Point San Luis, accessible via a scenic docent-led hike or by trolley, is home to a lighthouse that dates back to 1890 and is the only surviving Prairie Victorian on the West Coast. Visitors looking for relaxation can soak in nearby mineral hot springs or lounge on the sandy beach that gives the town its name.\\n* '''[[Carrizo Plain National Monument]]''' - 75 miles (120 km) east of San Luis Obispo, this remote national monument is home to the largest remaining native grassland in California. During wet years it boasts spectacular wildflowers in the spring, and Soda Lake is an important wintering area for waterfowl when precipitation is sufficient to flood the seasonal lakebed. The park is also home to Painted Rock, a Native American site that has been adorned with pictographs over thousands of years. Services are extremely limited, with just a small visitor center, two primitive campgrounds, and a handful of marked trails available.\\n* '''[[Los Osos]]''' - gateway to Montana Del Oro State Park.\\n* '''[[Morro Bay]]''' - 13 miles (21 km) northwest of San Luis Obispo, this coastal town is best known for the massive 581-foot (177 m) volcanic rock that dominates its harbor, but is also a great spot to see marine mammals and is home to one of California's oldest fine art and craft shows.\\n* '''[[Paso Robles]]''' - Paso Robles is a historical resort town known for its hot springs that is 31 miles (50 km) north of San Luis Obispo. This city's major industry is wine production, with vineyards located throughout the surrounding area.\\n* '''[[Pismo Beach]]''' - This tourism-focused coastal town is located 13 miles (21 km) south of San Luis Obispo.  It has more than 65 restaurants and 30 lodging options, and draws visitors with its beautiful coastline, annual clam festival, and the thousands of monarch butterflies that gather to spend the winter in a grove at the edge of town.\\n* '''[[San Simeon]]''' - 42 miles (68 km) northwest of San Luis Obispo, San Simeon is home to Hearst Castle, the impressive residence of the former media tycoon William Randolph Hearst, now managed as a state park with tours available daily. A massive colony of more than 20,000 elephant seals can be viewed onshore just north of town every winter.\\n\\n{{routebox\\n| image1=US 101.svg\\n| imagesize1=22\\n| directionl1=N\\n| majorl1=[[Salinas]]\\n| minorl1=[[Atascadero]] \\u2190 Jct [[File:California 58.svg|18px]] [[McKittrick|E]]\\n| directionr1=S\\n| majorr1=[[Santa Barbara]]\\n| minorr1=[[Pismo Beach]]\\n\\n| image2=California 1.svg\\n| imagesize2=22\\n| link2=Pacific Coast Highway\\n| directionl2=N\\n| majorl2=[[Monterey (California)|Monterey]]\\n| minorl2=[[Morro Bay]]\\n| directionr2=S\\n| majorr2=[[Santa Barbara]]\\n| minorr2=Merges with [[File:US 101.svg|18px]] \\u2192 [[Pismo Beach]]\\n\\n| image3=Amtrak Pacific Surfliner Icon.png\\n| imagesize3=100\\n| directionl3=N\\n| majorl3=END\\n| minorl3=\\n| directionr3=S\\n| majorr3=[[Santa Barbara]]\\n| minorr3=[[Grover Beach]]\\n}}\\n\\n{{geo|35.274|-120.663|zoom=13}}\\n{{isPartOf|San Luis Obispo County}}\\n{{usablecity}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Santa Barbara alternate banner.jpg}}\\n[[Image:Stearns Wharf - Santa Barbara, California.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Stearn's Wharf, Santa Barbara]]\\n\\n'''[http://www.santabarbaraca.com/ Santa Barbara]''' is a city and metropolitan area less than 100 miles (160 km) from [[Los Angeles]] but vastly different in pace from its huge neighbor to the south. With a temperate climate and lush natural environs, the \\\"Riviera of the West\\\" is a pleasant day or weekend trip from L.A. Its wide beaches, highly rated wineries, and a large variety of shopping and dining choices enable the town of just 90,000 residents to enjoy the sort of cultural and social amenities which are usually found only in much larger cities.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nAlthough the common perception of Santa Barbara is as a playground for the rich and famous, the reality is that the average income within city limits is only slightly higher than California as a whole. Notable for its California Mission-style architecture (a long-standing local ordinance ensures that all commercial construction follows the Mission theme, which results in a plethora of red-tiled roofs and ''faux'' adobe supermarkets), local residents are intensely proud of their city's roots and traditions, and a number of hugely popular festivals throughout the year celebrate the many cultures found in the city.\\n\\nIn addition, the city's large Latino population, concentrated in the east side of the city around Milpas Street, means there are a great many tacquerias and Mexican restaurants to be found. Santa Barbara has also been influenced by Los Angeles' food-truck scene.\\n\\n===Orientation===\\n[[File:Santa Barbara Airport 5173.jpg|thumb|Santa Barbara Airport]]\\nThe city of Santa Barbara is part of what's known as the South Coast, so named because the coastline between Point Conception and the city of [[Ventura]] faces more south than west. The road that serves as the city's nexus is '''State Street''', which runs northwest-southeast in and near downtown and east-west in the uptown area. It continues west as Hollister Avenue through [[Goleta]]. The area immediately to the east of lower State Street, between the waterfront and Highway 101, is known as the '''Funk Zone''' and has become one of the premier tourist areas of Santa Barbara, and is home to wineries, breweries, art galleries and restaurants, as well as a more youthful and trendier atmosphere. Just a few blocks above the Funk Zone, State Street becomes pedestrian only for eight blocks before opening up to traffic again. The eight blocks closed to cars, called the '''State Street Promenade''' are the core of Santa Barbara's downtown. The Latino part of town is on the east side of the city and has its own main street, '''Milpas Street''', which is almost {{mi|1}} away from, but parallel to, State Street in and near downtown. Upper State Street connects to Highway 154, a state highway that connects Santa Barbara with Los Olivos and wine country. \\n\\nThe orientation can be confusing to visitors, especially since locals often give directions as though the mountains were east, rather than north, and the ocean west, rather than south. \\\"Go north on the 101\\\" means literally \\\"go west\\\"; and if someone says \\\"south of town\\\" they don't mean in the ocean, but down the coast in the direction of Carpinteria and Ventura. \\n\\nSanta Barbara's downtown neighborhoods are generally working, middle- and upper-middle-class areas, while [[Montecito]] to the east of the city and Hope Ranch to the west are two of the city's wealthy enclaves, known as part-time hideouts for [[Hollywood]] celebrities and rich retirees. \\n\\n{{listing\\n| name=Santa Barbara Visitors Center | url=http://www.santabarbaraca.com/visitor-info/visitors-center/ | email=\\n| address=1 Garden Street, downtown | lat=34.414259 | long=-119.68714 | directions=\\n| phone=+1 805-965-3021 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=9AM (10AM on Su) - 5PM (4PM Nov-Jan) | price=\\n| content=Has information about Santa Barbara, including maps, pricing and hours of attractions, restaurant guides, bus and waterfront shuttle schedules.\\n}}\\n\\n===Climate===\\nSanta Barbara has a slightly different climate from the rest of the area. It maintains idyllic temperatures for most of the year and it is rare to go a week during any season without at least one day reaching {{F|70}}. There are occasional temperature extremes: heat waves are common in the late summer and early fall, and night time temperatures can reach down into the thirties during the winter. The best times to travel are not always what travelers expect. Spring and early summer are cool and cloudy through the mornings and often into the afternoons, with temperatures in the {{F|60}}s and low {{F|70}}s in what the locals call \\\"May Gray\\\" and \\\"June Gloom\\\". During August and early September temperatures get into the {{F|80}}s and cloudy days are rare. In mid to late September and October daytime temperatures stay mostly in the {{F|70}}s. The rainy season typically lasts from November through March, but even during the rainy season more days are sunny than not.\\n\\n{{climate\\n| units = imperial\\n| align = none\\n| janhigh =   65    | febhigh =   65    | marhigh =   66    | aprhigh =   69\\n| mayhigh =   70    | junhigh =   71    | julhigh =   75    | aughigh =   76\\n| sephigh =   75    | octhigh =   73    | novhigh =   69    | dechigh =   65\\n| janlow =    46    | feblow =    48    | marlow =    50    | aprlow =    52\\n| maylow =    55    | junlow =    58    | jullow =    60    | auglow =    60\\n| seplow =    60    | octlow =    56    | novlow =    50    | declow =    47\\n| janprecip = 4.4   | febprecip = 4.6   | marprecip = 2.9   | aprprecip = 1.2\\n| mayprecip = 0.3   | junprecip = 0.1   | julprecip = 0.0   | augprecip = 0.1\\n| sepprecip = 0.1   | octprecip = 0.9   | novprecip = 1.8   | decprecip = 3.0\\n| description = {{ForecastNOAA|Santa Barbara|34.4167|-119.6844}} &#160;&#160; Data from [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/normals NOAA (1981-2010)]\\n}}\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{mapframe|34.42|-119.71|zoom=12}}\\n{{mapshape}}\\n\\n===By plane===\\n* {{listing | type=go\\n| name=Santa Barbara Municipal Airport | alt={{IATA|SBA}} | url=http://www.flysba.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat=34.426111 | long=-119.840278 | directions=near the neighboring town of [[Goleta]]\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikipedia=Santa Barbara Municipal Airport | image=Santa Barbara Airport Terminal.jpg | wikidata=Q515748\\n|lastedit=2020-04-17| content=The local airport for the area, {{mi|7}} west of downtown.

From the 101, coming from the south, downtown Santa Barbara can be accessed via the Garden St. exit, while the beaches can be found off the Cabrillo Blvd. off ramp. From the north, get off the 101 at either the Mission or Carrillo St. off ramps. Traffic patterns are the opposite from the famous Los Angeles grid lock, as the southbound 101 can come to a grinding halt on Sunday afternoons.\\n\\nState Route 154 is a secondary road that leads over the mountains to the Santa Ynez Valley, and to towns like [[Los Olivos]] and [[Solvang]]; it is accurately [https://dot.ca.gov/programs/design/lap-landscape-architecture-and-community-livability/lap-liv-i-scenic-highways designated a \\\"Scenic Highway\\\" by the California Department of Transportation].

One confusing wrinkle is the presence of 3 similarly named major streets, Carrillo St, Castillo St, and Cabrillo Blvd. Don't mix them up.

Today, Mission Santa Barbara is both a scenic wonder and a fine anthropological study of original native culture in the surrounding area. Santa Barbara is the only California mission with twin bell towers, owing to its status as a cathedral in the early days of California statehood. It also has had a longer continuous association with the Franciscans than any other mission, and a longer continuous history of choral music than any other mission. The headquarters of the mission system in the 1830s and 40s, it is where many of the archives of the California missions are held. Note the adjacent pottery kiln and tanning vat ruins. The mission also features a small but well-regarded rose garden. The mission continues to be used as an active church, with regular masses on Wednesdays, Sundays, and holy days.

While most trips to the Channel Islands depart from [[Ventura]], Truth Aquatics runs trips from Santa Barbara.\\n* '''[[Goleta]]''' - Neighboring Santa Barbara to the west, Goleta offers similar beaches and resorts to its more famous neighbor. It is also home to a grove of trees that is an overwintering area for monarch butterflies, with the insects gathering in huge numbers each year from mid-November until mid-February.\\n*'''[[Los Olivos]]''' - About {{mi|50}} north of Santa Barbara on Highway 154. This is a cute little one-horse town with about 20 local winery tasting rooms lined up on Grand St. A great place to go wine tasting without having to drive a zillion miles from winery to winery.\\n* '''[[Montecito]]''' - This affluent town is located just east of Santa Barbara along the coast and is home to many rich and famous, including Oprah Winfrey.  Montecito Village is home to some interesting shops and markets, while upscale resorts can be found on the coast.\\n* '''[[Solvang]]''' - Located approximately {{mi|40}} north of Santa Barbara in the Santa Ynez Valley, Solvang is a gingerbread town. What must have started several decade back as a small \\\"Little Denmark\\\" tourist trap has grown into an entire town and surrounding community obsessed with its own overwhelming Danishness. Every sign, roof, light post and pothole is Danish-themed here, and reports of wandering bands of drunken men in plastic Viking helmets are firmly founded in reality. Take Highway 101 north/west to Buellton (the home of the original Pea Soup Anderson's), exit at the Highway 246 offramp and follow the destination signs to Solvang. If you're up for a twisty drive, take Highway 154 (also known as the San Marcos Pass) back to Santa Barbara at sunset and enjoy an unforgettable view.\\n* '''[[Santa Ynez]]''' - {{mi|31}} northwest of Santa Barbara, Santa Ynez sits at the heart of the rural Santa Ynez valley, an area that attracts travelers to its many wineries. The valley was the setting for the 2004 film ''Sideways'', and fans of the film are known to make pilgrimages to the inns and restaurants from the movie.\\n*'''Wine Country'''. North on US 101 or Highway 154; pretty much all of the county north of the mountains.\\n*'''[[Los Angeles]]''' is about {{mi|90}} down the coast, but whether you take the 101 or the Pacific Coast Highway (Route 1), be prepared for a major tie-up somewhere along the route in the best of times. With no traffic, the trip could take you 90 minutes, but actual driving time is often easily twice that and can be more. Both routes have their appeal, though, as after they diverge in Ventura, Route 1 goes past beautiful coastline and the Malibu Cliffs, whereas the 101 climbs over the Conejo Grade into [[Thousand Oaks]] and then the [[San Fernando Valley]].  Also accessible by Amtrak, Flixbus, or Greyhound. Contrary to popular belief, Los Angeles does have decent public transportation and a car-free weekend can be had at places like Hollywood or Santa Monica.\\n\\n{{routebox\\n| image1=US 101.svg\\n| imagesize1=22\\n| image1a=California 1.svg\\n| imagesize1a=22\\n| directionl1=N\\n| majorl1=[[San Luis Obispo]]\\n| minorl1=[[Goleta]]\\n| directionr1=S\\n| majorr1=[[Los Angeles]] [[Image:US 101.svg|18px]] / [[Long Beach]] [[Image:California 1.svg|18px]]\\n| minorr1=[[Montecito]]\\n\\n| image2=California 154.svg\\n| imagesize2=22\\n| directionl2=W\\n| majorl2=[[Los Olivos]]\\n| minorl2=[[Santa Ynez]]\\n| directionr2=E\\n| majorr2=END\\n| minorr2=\\n\\n| image3=Amtrak Pacific Surfliner Icon.png\\n| imagesize3=100\\n| directionl3=N\\n| majorl3=[[San Luis Obispo]]\\n| minorl3=[[Goleta]]\\n| directionr3=S\\n| majorr3=[[Los Angeles]]\\n| minorr3=[[Carpinteria]]\\n}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{isPartOf|Santa Barbara County}}\\n{{usablecity}}\\n{{geo|34.42|-119.71|zoom=13}}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.2541821653526054, "reason": "The actual output correctly identifies U.S. Highway 101 as the major highway to San Luis Obispo, which aligns with the expected output's query.

San Martin. The observatory spans 3000 km\\u00b2 and you can catch a glimpse of its immense size when arriving to Malargue by ruta 40. The surface part of the observatory consists of 1600 \\\"tanks\\\" - plastics barells filled with very pure water, equipped with electronics, solar panels and communication antennae, distributed over the pampa in a triangular grid with 1.5 km spacing. \\n\\nThe first tanks can be seen about halfway between San Rafael and El Sosneado and they extend all the way to Malargue - it takes about an hour to pass through the whole array at the maximum legal speed! There are also 4 fluorescence detector stations with telescopes operating at night, at the edges of the surface array. Two of them can be also seen from ruta 40: Loma Amarilla between San Rafael and El Sosneado (closer to the later, several kilometers north of the road) and Coiuheco (only a few minutes south from El Sosneado, on a prominent hill in the west directly above road, easily seen just before the settlement of Coiuheco), but it is not generally possible to go inside to see the telescopes due to safety concerns. (There are two more stations: Los Morados in the east is unreachable without a 4x4, but Los Leones in the south is only 20 km from Malargue on the unpaved road to General Alvear and it is an easily recognizable landmark of the otherwise flat area).\\n\\nThe best view of the whole array is probably from the plateau near the Cohuieco station (the building is locked, but the hill is publicly accessible, the road is rough but doable in a normal car). There you can see at least several dozen tanks and (when the air is extremely clear) also all the Fluorescence stations at the edges of the field - here you can really get the impression of the extreme scale of the project! If you are genuinely interested in the project, you can ask in the visitors centre to be introduced to some of the physicists - usually there is at least a couple of people from all around the world working on site.\\n\\n==Do==\\nIn the city, there is the '''Molino Rufino Ortega''', an old mill next the Parque de Ayer and the small museum featuring trilobites and other local archeological finds.\\n\\nEven though the surroundings of the city may look deserted in the high summer, but the pampa fills with water after heavy rains and for longer periods in the spring, making the immediate Malargue area a world-class spot for '''birdwatching'''! In such a case, you may see Flamingos and two kind of Ibises in small lagoons only a few kilometers from the city - the easiest way to look for them is the road to General Alvear to the east which is signposted at the clock junction (but you have to search you way a little). Colorful Austral Parakeets are often seen directly in the city and large dark Turkey Vultures (actually a small variant of the Condor) concentrate on high communication towers in all parts of the town. Together, several dozens of easily identified bird species can be seen during several days of stay in the area, making it an excellent choice for bird-watching beginners.\\n\\nTours can be booked to see the caves '''Caverna de las Brujas''' (60 km south by ruta 40, but do not attempt to go there blindly, you must pay your visit in advance in Malargue, in the \\\"Turismo\\\" office in front of the Observatory), a castle-shaped mountain called '''Castillos de Pincheira''' (25 km west, signposted near the YPF station on Av. San Martin), and a lake featuring flamingos, '''Laguna Llancanelo''' (see the La Payuina trip for instructions and note that the chance to see the Flamingos depends on the highly variable water levels in the extremely shallow lake). Other natural features are the '''Pozos de las Animas''', a large pair of sinkholes, the '''Laguna Ni\\u00f1a Encantada''', a small clear pool fed by streams in the foothills of the Andes (both on the road to Las Le\\u0148as). Less accessible is Valle Hermoso, a large picturesque valley to the northwest of Malargue (see details below).\\n\\nNearby are many extinct volcanic cones, the largest being Cerro Diamante to the north. To the south is the Reserva la Payunia containing many volcanoes and lava flows.\\n\\nIf you have your own (or rental) car, you can also visit most of the sights on your own, but most of the local maps are surprisingly unreliable, particularly concerning getting to the volcanic paradise of La Payunia (to add confusion, the local roadsigns are inconsistent). Contrary to what you may be told by the travel agencies, you do not need a 4x4 vehicle for most of the really interesting things during the summer.\\n\\nThere are two passable roads to the heart of '''La Payunia''', one is easier to navigate, while the other is easier to find. It is best to make a round trip. Start early (07:00-08;00), pack a lot of water and food, warm clothes (even in summer) and go preferably at least by two cars - if your car breaks down, you may end up 50 km from the nearest civilization, with no cell phone coverage outside Malargue. Head south on ruta 40 and after about 15 minutes turn left - the road is signed to Llancanelo and La Payunia. After a couple of kilometers, the road becomes unpaved. At the first crossroad, go left (not to Volcan Malacara, which you should visit on other day, it is interesting on its own), at the next one, you have a choice - you may take a short stop at Llancanelo (but remember, the journey is long.) using the left road, or take the right one skipping the Laguna entirely. After passing by Llancanelo, both roads join ways again and shortly after the way passes by a hill with a prominent rocky outcrop. Look out for a small junction posted \\\"Pampa negra\\\" and turn right (south). After about 30 km you enter the land of the Llama (you are bound to see at least on herd of these funny animals) and much later also the land of the oil. Try to avoid the oilfield by driving to the right of it, the oifield is a maze of roads where you can spend three hours trying to get out. Behind the oilfield, turn left (there are new signs \\\"Circuito turistico\\\") and head south for the volcanoes that you now see clearly in front of you. When you reach the base of the lava flow, the road gets much worse, but with care it is still passable in Chevrolet Corsa (the basic rental car). Be careful with the underside of the car and try to keep wheels outside the lowest parts of the road. When you ascent the hill, you have reached Pampa Negra and you will understand the name! Continue about 15 km south to the base of Volcan Payun, where there is a small parking below a lava flow and the road ceases to be passable. On the way back, you can use the same road, or turn left after the oilfield and go over a hill to the valley of Rio Grande. After reaching the valley, try to keep left, the only bridge over the river is on ruta 40, to the southwest from you. If you reach this place, you won't regret the detour as you will see the mighty Rio Grande squeezed into a 5-m ravine. Continue north on ruta 40 and if you have time, you can visit the petrified forest (Bosque Petrificado) just before Bardas Blancas.\\n\\nTo reach '''Valle Hermoso''', by car, you will need to be there between roughly the end of November and March, to avoid snow on the high mountain pass behind Las Le\\u0148as. Observe the same precautions as mentioned earlier, with the addition of an extra layer of clothes as you are going over 3000 m above the sea level this time! Follow ruta 40 north from Malargue and turn left after 30 km to Las Le\\u0148as. If you started early, you will have time to visit Pozos de las Animas and  Laguna Ni\\u00f1a Encantada on the way to Las Le\\u0148as as both sights are directly on the road, which is paved, albeit a little too holey. Pass through Las Le\\u0148as and reach the end of the paved road in a few minutes. Now be extremely cautious about a couple of streams crossing the road - they change all the time and may have edges a little too steep for your wheels! If you manage to cross them, and seemingly endless ascent starts, to about 3200 m a.s.l. If you reach the altitude (that is, no snow-field is there to stop you), you will see a small junction with a road to the left that is probably still closed. You can leave you car here and walk along the road for about a kilometer to reach a beautiful lagoon that may be still frozen in November. Go back to your car and continue on the road, descending shortly to Valle Hermoso proper. Enjoy the colorful rocks, the lagoon and try to look for petroglyphs near the road. If you do not have a 4x4 and lots of offroad experience, do not under any circumstances attempt to cross the river about 1 kilometer after the lagoon. It is deep enough to reliably destroy any standard (non off-road) car by flooding the engine with water. Return using the same path.\\n\\nAnother interesting trip may be '''Termas de Sosneado'''. Arriving from Malargue, turn left at El Sosneado just after the checkpoint (at the petrol station) and turn left again at the next chance, following \\\"Termas de Azurfe\\\" sign, if it is still up. Continue a rough road to the beautiful Laguna Sosneado just below the slopes of Cerro Sosneado, the world's southernmost five-thousander! The place where Cerro Sosneado touches the river is the most dangerous part of the road, be considerate about your ability to return, before you descend from the highest point of the road! After another 20 km, you arrive at a group of fallen stone buildings and there you find a wonderful, natural and completely free thermal bath, almost 2500 m above the sea level. Remember that Argentina is a very religious country and do not attempt to bath naked (it is actually a good idea to have a more decent swimsuit than you would wear to the beaches in the Caribic)! Follow the same road back.\\n\\nFinally the longest, but for many the most rewarding, northbound trip takes you to '''Ca\\u0148on del Atuel''' an amazing, almost a hundred kilometer long canyon, which is unfortunately almost dry at the bottom due to an extensive hydro-energetic use of the river. To enter the canyon from above you need to go almost 200 km from Malargue in the direction of San Rafael, turning left to El Nihuil at the only reasonable junction you will see on the way. From El Nihuil, descent directly to the canyon and continue to be amazed by the views for next 2 to 3 hours. You can return through San Rafael, or using the same road.\\n\\n==Buy==\\nAfter many years of struggle between the tourists and the small kiosks where you have to ask for the right item in Spanish, Malaruge has a supermarket. SuperVea is located some 5 blocks west from the clock tower and is opened daily from 09:00 to 21:00 with a siesta around 13:30 to 17:00. It is by far the most convenient place to buy food, alcohol and even small items from different other areas, within 200 km. Visa cards are accepted (others sometimes as well, but reluctantly), but an ID is required on every purchase. Be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes in the line during rush hours, as the clerks are notoriously slow.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nThere are many restaurants and cafes in Malargue. Most of the big hotels have attached restaurants. Steaks are good value, seen on the menu as bife de lomo or bife de chorizo. Also available are chicken and goat. Vegetarians may have few choices, some of the pasta dishes can be had without meat.\\n\\nOutside of town to the south is a trout hatchery called Cuyam-co which has an attached restaurant. They serve trout cooked in foil with vegetables which is quite good, but you must call in advance to make a reservation (otherwise there will be no fish ready for you!) - call (02627) 15661917.\\n\\nIn most of the restaurants, you can get food from the grill (la parilla) only on Friday and Saturday nights - except maybe in the upscale (in Malargue terms) El quincho de Mar\\u00eda, Av. San Mart\\u00edn 440, (02627) 472525, which specializes on parilla and where you can also try some quite unusual parts of animal). Another good choices in this range are La Cima and Rio Grande, directly across the street from each other, next to the Esso station at the northern entrance to the city.\\n\\nIf you aim for a little lower prices and a very local environment, you may try La Posta, Av. Roca (Este) 174, (02627) 471306, two blocks east from the clock tower - if you don't like the wait (which can extend to one hour), they also deliver within Malargue without a surcharge.\\n\\n==Drink==\\nMost all the restaurants will serve alcohol. The local beer is Andes, with Quilmes and Heineken also available. A drink that is popular throughout Argentina is Fernet Branca and Coca cola.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\nThere are between 10 and 20 hotels in Malarg\\u00fce, as well as a large number of cabins. There is an eco-hostel by Hostelling International, which is out of town. Popular hotels are Microtel (***), Rio Grande (***), El Cisne (**) and Turismo (**).\\n\\n==Go next==\\n* [[Santiago]]\\n* [[Catedral Alta Patagonia]]\\n\\n{{IsPartOf|Mendoza (province)}}\\n{{outlinecity}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{geo|-35.474458333333|-69.585294444444}}\", \"{{pagebanner|WV banner Alavieska church.jpg}}\\n\\n'''[https://www.alavieska.fi/vapaa-aika/matkailu Alavieska]''' is a town and municipality in the [[Southern Oulu region]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n{{mapframe}}\\n{{mapshape}}\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By bus===\\nBuses on the [[Kokkola]]-[[Kalajoki]]-[[Ylivieska]] line stop here.\\n\\n===By car===\\nHighway 27 between Kalajoki and Ylivieska runs parallel to the Kalajoki river.

The whole island forms a municipality, Sado City. The historical gold mines of the island became a cultural {{unesco}} in 2024. \\n\\n==Understand==\\n\\nLong a remote place of exile for political dissidents, including a deposed monarch, '''Emperor Juntoku''', and the Buddhist monk '''Nichiren''', Sado experienced a boom during the Edo era when gold was found at Aikawa.  A major source of revenue for the Tokugawa shogunate that at one time accounted for as much as a fifth of the world's gold production, the mines were worked in horrific conditions by what amounted to slave labor, consisting largely of homeless people rounded up from the mainland.  In 1897, the mines were sold to Mitsubishi, who kept up production and during World War 2 forcibly imported around 2,000 Koreans to work shifts of up to 16 hours per day.  Only in 1989 did the mines finally close their doors.\\n\\nDespite this grim history, today's Sado is a pleasant summer getaway of rocky coasts, green hills and quaint fishing ports, with a permanent population of 50,000 (2022).  Shaped a bit like an anvil, the largest town {{marker|type=city|name=Ry\\u014dtsu|wikidata=Q1042710}} (\\u4e21\\u6d25) is nestled in the eastern gap.  {{marker|type=city|name=Ogi|wikidata=Q11460942}} (\\u5c0f\\u6728) is on the southern coast, while the former gold-mining town of {{marker|type=city|name=Aikawa|wikidata=Q11582006}} (\\u76f8\\u5ddd) lies to the north.\\n\\nAlthough the island has been populated for millennia, a large area of Sado (especially outside the central plain) remains uninhabited. Road access for the Northeastern part of the island can become problematic in the winter after heavy snow. The mountainous geography of the island certainly accounts for this.\\n\\nThe northern half of the island is covered with the '''\\u014c-Sado mountain range''' (\\u5927\\u4f50\\u6e21), the southern with the '''Ko-sado''' (\\u5c0f\\u4f50\\u6e21) mountain range, the Osado range being higher (with peaks over 1000 m). In between, the '''Kuninaka''' (\\u56fd\\u4ef2) plain is covered with rice fields and is more heavily populated.\\n\\nThe '''weather''' is pleasant in the summer, but winters can be harsh. It does not get outrageously cold, but it can get rather windy, and it often snows. Transportation to and on the island can be affected, with canceled ferries and roads closed.\\n\\nOverall, visitors to Sado will enjoy its '''nice rural landscapes''' and its relative \\\"remoteness\\\" from the frenzy of the mainland. It is precisely the kind of old and rural Japan that some travel long distances for.\\n\\n===Tourist information site===\\nThe local tourist association has a [http://www.visitsado.com/en/ multilingual guide site].\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\nSado's airport has no scheduled service.

Prices above are for second class. Renting a blanket costs an extra &yen;100.  The future of the Naoetsu-Ogi line is uncertain, travelers would be wise to check beforehand that it's still running. A third line between Teradomari and Akadomari is still mentioned in some places on the official website, but has been permanently canceled since May 2019.\\n\\nThe jet ferries have only one class. On car ferries almost everyone uses 2nd class with access to the lower two decks. You can lie down on hard carpet floor or sit on plastic chairs on the second deck.  All lines are operated by '''[https://www.sadokisen.co.jp/ Sado Kisen]'''.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n{{mapframe|38.016666666667|138.36666666667|zoom=10}}\\n* '''Hitchhiking''' is a fairly good means of getting around. (There are no bears on Sado Island.)\\n*You might want to consider '''renting a car''' (some rent a car in Ry\\u014dtsu after getting off the ferry). Although the island is not very large, the coastal scenic roads are quite windy. A round-the-island drive following the coastal road would be over 250 km long, and take at least a day.\\n*'''Bicycle''' is an option, but accessing the more remote outer coasts, where some major tourist spots are located, will require you to climb some strenuous passages. Electric bicycle rental is available at the Sagata bus center, at Aikawa Orito, and in other places. Prices start from &yen;500 for the first hour and increase by &yen;200 per hour, capped at &yen;2000 per day.\\n[[File:Sado map updated.png|thumb|Sado Map]]\\n\\n==See==\\n===O-Sado/Aikawa===\\n* {{listing | type=see\\n| name=Sado Gold Mine | alt=\\u4f50\\u6e21\\u91d1\\u5c71 ''Sado Kinzan'' | url=http://sado-kinzan.com/en | email=gsado@sado-kinzan.com\\n| address= | lat=38.04203 | long=138.2591 | directions=3 km from Aikawa\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=Daily 08:00-17:30 (15:00 in winter) | price=Sohdayu Tunnel: \\u00a5900, Dohyu Tunnel: \\u00a5900, both: \\u00a51400\\n| lastedit=2019-05-12\\n| content=A former gold and silver mine, features two courses.\\n}}<br>The first and older tunnel is Sohdayu Tunnel (Edo period).

Particularly well known are the '''Sotokaifu Coast''' (\\u5916\\u6d77\\u5e9c\\u6d77\\u5cb8) and its '''Senkaku Bay''' (\\u5c16\\u95a3\\u6e7e), to the north of Aikawa.\\n* The huge '''\\u014cno-game''' (\\u5927\\u91ce\\u4e80) rock (over 160 m high) is on the northern coast of the island, with a small sand stretch joining it to the mainland. In this area is also located the '''Futatsu-game''' formation (\\u4e8c\\u3064\\u4e80), two islands said to look like two turtles. Between Futatsu-game and Ono-game lies a '''Sainokawara''' (\\u8cfd\\u306e\\u6cb3\\u539f), a limbo for dead children according to Buddhist mythology. This spooky place is located at the entrance of a cave, dotted with small statues and dolls, right on the coastline.\\n* The windy '''\\u014c-Sado Skyline''' road, joining '''Kanai'''(\\u91d1\\u4e95) and '''Aikawa''' (\\u76f8\\u5ddd), climbs through the slopes of '''Mt Kinpoku''' (\\u91d1\\u5317\\u5c71 ''Kinpoku-san'') for some very nice views of the whole of the island, especially around the spot called '''Hakuundai''' (\\u767d\\u96f2\\u53f0). The road is closed during winter (end of November to April). The area around the summit of Mt Kinpoku is a restricted area under the supervision of the Japanese Self-Defense forces. It is possible to treck from the road to the summit, but necessary authorizations should be obtained.\\n\\n===Kuninaka===\\n* There are a number of temples connected with the Nichiren faith on the island, including '''Konponji''' (\\u6839\\u672c\\u5bfa), built on the location of his exile, '''My\\u014dsenji''' (\\u5999\\u5ba3\\u5bfa) and '''My\\u014dsh\\u014dji''' (\\u5999\\u7167\\u5bfa).\\n* Close to Konponji, '''Seisuiji''' (\\u6e05\\u6c34\\u5bfa) is a Sado version of the Kiyomizudera temple in [[Kyoto]].

Take your time and visit the '''Rengebu-ji''' temple (\\u84ee\\u83ef\\u5cf0\\u5bfa) near the town.\\n* On the south coast, close to Ogi, lies the small and picturesque harbour of '''Shukunegi''' (\\u5bbf\\u6839\\u6728) with traditional wooden houses reminiscent of the Edo period. This settlement is close to '''Yajima-Ky\\u014djima''' (\\u77e2\\u5cf6\\u7d4c\\u5cf6), one of the most famous places on the island to try Taraibune (see [[Sado_Island#Do|Do]] section)\\n* West of Ogi and very close to town itself is the '''[https://shukunegi.com/spot/ogiminzokuhakubutsukan/ Sadokoku Ogi Folk Museum]''' (\\u4f50\\u6e21\\u56fd\\u5c0f\\u6728\\u6c11\\u4fd7\\u535a\\u7269\\u9928), housing hundreds of everyday life items from old and less old times. The display is somewhat chaotic, but it is still an interesting place to visit. The museum also houses a full-scale replica of a 19th-century freight vessel, with plenty of explanations about the role of Sado as a major stop on old naval routes.\\n* In Hamochi (\\u7fbd\\u8302) near Ogi, Marudai, a Miso maker offers the possibility to visit a Miso production facility, with a small '''[http://www.e-sadonet.tv/~vivamaru/museum/museum.html Miso museum]'''. Entry is free.\\n\\n==Do==\\n* The '''[http://www.kodo.or.jp/ec/ Earth Celebration]''' is a yearly arts festival run by the ''taiko'' (Japanese drumming) group '''Kod\\u014d''' since 1988.  Performers from around the world join the event, culminating in Kodo's famously physical drumming performances on the bass-laden ''\\u014c-daiko'' (great drum).  The group lives and works out in spartan conditions on the island year-round, and once ran from the finish line of [[Boston]] Marathon onto stage for a performance.  Tickets are pricey (&yen;4000+) but well worth it. Book early as only 1000 are sold &mdash; the concerts are all acoustic and would not support more. The event takes place in the Ogi area, in late August.\\n* For a more tame experience, take a spin (literally) in one of Ogi's ''tarai-bune'', tiny little boats inconveniently shaped like barrels and rented out to tourists by the hour. Close to Ogi '''Yajima-Ky\\u014djima''' is also a famous spot at which to ''tarai-bune''.\\n* There is a (very) small [http://sadoski.net/ ski field] in Kanai, with three lifts.\\n* Sado hosts an International '''[http://www.scsf.jp/triathlon/ Triathlon]''' each year the first Sunday of September, with around 1700 participants from Japan and overseas.\\n* Although Sado is far from being a tropical island, you can bring your bathing suit in the summer and take a short swim at the beach in Sawata or in the northern tip of the island. Diving in Sado is quite popular and there are a few '''diving''' centers, in the Ogi area and Senego.\\n*[https://ogiodc.jimdofree.com/ Ogi Diving Center].\\n* '''Trekking''' is very enjoyable in the O-sado mountain range (Northern range of the island).

It is the capital of [[Miyagi]] prefecture. As everyone here will tell you, \\\"Sendai is not too big and not too small, it's very convenient and it's close to both the sea and the mountains.\\\"\\n\\n[[Sakunami]] hot springs area of the city has a separate article.\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Zuiho-den15s3200.jpg|300px|thumb|Zuihoden]]\\nSendai is divided into five districts: Aoba-ku (\\u9752\\u8449\\u533a), Izumi-ku (\\u6cc9\\u533a), Miyagino-ku (\\u5bae\\u57ce\\u91ce\\u533a), Taihaku-ku (\\u592a\\u767d\\u533a) and Wakabayashi-ku (\\u82e5\\u6797\\u533a).\\n\\nSendai is a comfortable and pleasant city &mdash; it's a nice place to live. It's very green &mdash; in fact they call it \\u675c\\u306e\\u90fd (''Mori no Miyako'', \\\"The City of Trees\\\"). The main avenues around the city are wide and tree-lined, giving the city an almost European feel. The main shopping street, Ch\\u016b\\u014d-d\\u014dri (\\u4e2d\\u592e\\u901a\\u308a), is pedestrian and covered, so it feels like a mall. Several large universities are located in Sendai, attracting young adults from throughout the Tohoku area. In general, the city enjoys a high standard of education, and this is reflected in the quality of English spoken on this street, which is far higher than in other cities in the region.\\n\\n===History===\\nAlthough there is evidence of settlements in the Sendai region dating back over 20,000 years, it was not until the local feudal ruler, Date Masamune, moved his capital here in 1600 that the city began to take on any significance. He established a fine castle on Aobayama (green leaf mountain) and the town that was built below the castle near the Hirose River was built according to the traditional street grid pattern. The original name of the area was also Sendai, but the Chinese characters at the time were different (\\u5343\\u4ee3). They used to refer to a temple on Aobayama that housed a thousand Buddha statues. Later, Date Masamune changed the Chinese characters to mean 'hermit on a platform,' (\\u4ed9\\u53f0) which referred to a mythical palace in the mountains in China. It is this latter name that is used by the present-day city.\\n\\n===Climate===\\nThere are two ways of looking at the weather here. One is the way most Japanese people seem to look at it: it's not too cold in the winter and not too hot in the summer, compared to other Japanese cities to the south. Others find it chilly year round.\\n\\nWinter temperatures rarely dip below zero Celsius, and snow, though frequent in winter, melts quickly. Winter weather is very rainy, yielding to variable weather in spring. There is a long rainy season, marked by consistently cool and cloudy weather, which typically coincides with the month of June, but has been known to set in right after the cherry-blossom blooms in April and to continue through July, and even August.\\n\\nWhen (and if) the rainy season ends, summer weather is warm and humid, (average high in August is 28&nbsp;\\u00b0C (82&nbsp;\\u00b0F) until September, which brings typhoon season. Most of the typhoons do little damage, having dissipated somewhat on their travel north, but fall on Sendai as very heavy rainstorms, following one another in close succession.\\n\\nFor those who prefer dry sunny weather, autumn is the most reliable time for pleasant conditions in Sendai. In October, the weather becomes clear, dry and sunny, though cool, usually throughout the month and sometimes well into November. Daytime temperatures hover around 18&nbsp;\\u00b0C, with cooler nights. Rice harvesting is done at this time, while the fields found just outside the city are golden.\\n\\n===Tourist information site===\\n\\n*[https://discoversendai.travel/ Discover Sendai] is the city's official English tourist site.\\n\\n*[https://www.sentia-sendai.jp/english-guide/ Sendai Tourism, Convention and International Association] helps foreign tourists in various ways.\\n\\n==Get in==\\nSendai is 360&nbsp;km (220 miles) from [[Tokyo]], so it is often viewed as out of the way and difficult to access. However, it is a 90-minute shinkansen (bullet train) ride, or one hour flight then less than a 30-minute transfer to the city center. In fact, Sendai is 100&nbsp;km closer to Tokyo than the very popular [[Kyoto]], and boasts its own unique history, plenty of temples and shrines, and is far less crowded with tourists (with Sendai almost exclusively marketed to domestic and intra-Asian tourism).\\n\\n===  By plane  ===\\n'''[http://www.sendai-airport.co.jp/ Sendai Airport]''' (SDJ) mainly functions as a domestic airport with regular flights from [[Sapporo]], [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Okinawa]] and [[Kanazawa]](komatsu). However, there are also a few international flights from neighboring countries, such as [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[China]].\\n\\nThe airport is linked to the city with the [http://www.senat.co.jp/en/top Sendai Airport Access] railway, which takes 17\\u201325 minutes from JR Sendai Station and costs {{JPY|650}}. \\n\\nJR East also maintains an airport limousine bus between JR Sendai Expressway station (East Exit Stop 71, West Exit Stop 63-1) and Sendai Airport No.2 bus stop. From JR Sendai Station East Exit (add 10 minutes for West Exit), it operates F Sa Su M at 10:20, 13:20 and 16:20, taking about 47 minutes and costs {{JPY|800}} ({{JPY|8400}} for children). It is primarily aimed at travelers carrying significant amounts of luggage. From Sendai Airport, the airport limousine bus operates F Sa Su M at 09:05, 11:45, 15:25, and 18:00, taking about 45 minutes to Sendai Station West Exist and costs {{JPY|1000}} ({{JPY|500}} for children). Additionally, the bus departing from Sendai airport makes a stop at the Sendai Prefecture Office City Hall, whereas the inverse is not true. \\n\\n===By train===\\nSendai is a major station on the Tohoku Shinkansen (bullet train) line, some two hours from Tokyo. The line continues north to [[Morioka]] and [[Aomori]].\\n\\nThe most frequent ride from Tokyo is on the all-reserved ''Hayabusa'' (\\u306f\\u3084\\u3076\\u3055), which makes only a few stops and runs to Sendai in 1\\u00bd hours (\\u00a511,200). The ''Komachi'' (\\u3053\\u307e\\u3061) service bound for [[Akita]] is coupled to the Hayabusa train, but bear in mind that Komachi cars are slightly narrower, and therefore, so is seating.\\n\\nIf you have a little more time on your hands, or if any of the above trains are sold out, the more frequent ''Yamabiko'' (\\u3084\\u307e\\u3073\\u3053) services are a good alternative. The fare is slightly cheaper for reserved seating (\\u00a510,890), but the Yamabiko trains also offer a few cars of unreserved seating which are cheaper still ({{JPY|10370}}). The ''Yamabiko'' serves more stations \\u2014 and in some cases, ''all'' stations \\u2014 so the expected travel time will be about 30\\u201340 minutes longer than the ''Hayabusa'' and ''Komachi''.\\n\\nA few all-reserved ''Hayate'' (\\u306f\\u3084\\u3066) services remain on the route, and these are another alternative. The ''Hayate'' trains are only slightly slower than the ''Hayabusa'' and ''Komachi'', but cost the same as the ''Yamabiko''.\\n\\nThe Japan Rail Pass and JR East Rail Pass is valid for Ordinary and Green Cars on the all of the bullet trains mentioned above. On the other hand, rail passes will only cover the basic fare if you are willing to try out the premium first class seating on the '''Hayabusa''' called \\\"GranClass\\\". To use \\\"GranClass\\\" the limited express and GranClass fare has to be paid (\\u00a513,990 from Tokyo). Without a rail pass, \\\"GranClass\\\" costs \\u00a519,930 between Tokyo and Sendai.\\n\\nThe Joban Line runs between Sendai and Tokyo. Some services of the limited express ''Hitachi'' (\\u3072\\u305f\\u3061) terminates at Sendai, though as a non-high speed service, the entire journey takes about 4\\u00bd hours from Tokyo to Sendai.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nMany highway buses run to Sendai from various locations in the Tohoku region.\\n\\nJR Bus Tohoku and Tohoku Kyuko bus operate highway bus service to Sendai from [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku Station]] in Tokyo. There are five daytime trips and one overnight trip. Each run takes 5\\u00bd hours at a cost of \\u00a56,210.\\n\\nSame companies also run a line to [[Niigata]] across the mountains.

As the most populated urban area in the world, Tokyo is a fascinating and dynamic metropolis that mixes foreign influences, consumer culture and global business along with remnants of the capital of old Japan. From modern electronics and gleaming skyscrapers to cherry blossoms and the Imperial Palace, this city represents the entire sweep of Japanese history and culture. Tokyo truly has something for every traveller.\\n\\n==Districts==\\nThe capital of Japan is not a city, but is actually '''[[Tokyo (prefecture)|Tokyo Metropolis]]''' (\\u6771\\u4eac\\u90fd ''T\\u014dky\\u014d-to''), which apart from the name is indistinguishable from a prefecture: it's equal in status with the other 46 prefectures, and is about as big (containing large suburban and even rural areas to the west, as well as islands as far as {{km|1,000}} south). Even more strangely, there is no such thing as the \\\"city of Tokyo\\\". What most people, both foreigners and Japanese, are thinking of when they hear \\\"Tokyo\\\" is the '''special wards of Tokyo''' (\\u7279\\u5225\\u533a ''tokubetsu-ku''), sometimes just called the '''23 wards''' (23\\u533a ''nij\\u016bsan-ku''). They're somewhat like the boroughs of London or New York, except there's no \\\"city government\\\" banding them together. The wards refer to themselves as \\\"cities\\\" in English (since they behave as such, each having its own mayor and council), but to avoid confusion, most people prefer to call them \\\"wards\\\".\\n\\n'''This article is about the 23 special wards, while the western suburbs and the islands are covered in [[Tokyo (prefecture)|Tokyo Metropolis]].'''\\n\\nThe geography of central Tokyo is defined by the JR Yamanote Line (see [[#Get around|Get around]]). The center of Tokyo \\u2014 the former area reserved for the Shogun and his samurai \\u2014 lies within the loop, while the Edo-era oldtown (\\u4e0b\\u753a ''shitamachi'') is to the north and east. Sprawling around in all directions and blending in seamlessly are [[Yokohama]], [[Kawasaki]] and [[Chiba]], Tokyo's suburbs. Together, the entire metropolitan area has a population of over 40 million, making it the most populated urban area in the world.\\n\\n===Central

The city only truly began to grow when it became the seat of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603, who decided to set up a new seat of power far away from the intrigues of the imperial court in [[Kyoto]]. After the Tokugawa Shogunate collapsed in the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and the imperial family moved here from Kyoto, and the city was renamed to its current name, Tokyo, literally the \\\"Eastern Capital\\\". The metropolitan center of the country, Tokyo is the destination for business, education, modern culture, and government. (That's not to say that rivals such as [[Osaka]] won't dispute those claims.)\\n\\n===Culture===\\n\\n[[Image:Don Quijote in Shinjuku at night.jpg|thumb|[[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] at night]]\\n\\nTokyo is '''vast''': it's best thought of not as a single city, but a constellation of cities that have grown together. Tokyo's districts vary wildly by character, from the electronic blare of [[Tokyo/Akihabara|Akihabara]] to the Imperial gardens and shrines of [[Tokyo/Chiyoda|Chiyoda]], from the hyperactive youth culture hub of [[Tokyo/Shibuya|Shibuya]] to the pottery shops and temple markets of [[Tokyo/Asakusa|Asakusa]]. If you don't like what you see, hop on the train and head to the next station, and you will find something entirely different.\\n\\nThe sheer size and frenetic pace of Tokyo can intimidate the first-time visitor. Much of the city is a jungle of concrete and wires, with a mass of neon and blaring loudspeakers. At rush hour, crowds jostle in packed trains and masses of humanity sweep through enormous and bewilderingly complex stations. Don't get too hung up on ticking tourist sights off your list: for most visitors, the biggest part of the Tokyo experience is just wandering around at random and absorbing the vibe, poking your head into shops selling weird and wonderful things, sampling restaurants where you can't recognize a single thing on the menu (or on your plate), and finding unexpected oases of calm in the tranquil grounds of a neighbourhood Shinto shrine. It's all perfectly safe, and the locals will go to sometimes extraordinary lengths to help you if you just ask.\\n\\n===Expenses===\\n[[Image:Sakura at Tamagawadai-Kouen, Denenchofu, Tokyo.jpg|thumb|Cherry blossom picnic at Tamagawadai Park in [[Tokyo/Ota|Ota ward]]]]\\nThe cost of living in Tokyo is not as astronomical as it once was. Deflation and market pressures have helped to make costs in Tokyo comparable to most other large cities in the developed world. Visitors from [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Sydney]], [[Toronto]] and [[Dublin]] will not find it any more expensive than back home. Rent will be significantly cheaper than big Western cities like NYC, London, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Travelers should budget a similar amount of money for their stay in Tokyo as they would for any other great city in [[Europe]], [[North America]] or [[Australia]]. Locals will know the bargains, but experienced cheapskates from anywhere in the world can get by with a little ingenuity. Tokyo is one of the most popular places to live in Japan. Rent for a single's apartment could range from US$500 to US$1,000 a month. Tokyo is so overwhelmingly crowded that many people live in apartments no bigger than 16 square meters (175 square feet). That being said, with excellent transportation throughout Tokyo and its outskirts, living five minutes further away from central Tokyo could mean hundreds of dollars less for living expenses each month or allow for larger housing. Many parts of Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa, or even Ibaraki prefectures may allow the feeling of \\\"living in Tokyo\\\". Still, nothing compares to Tokyo itself in regards to waking up and stepping outside instantly into metropolitan life.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{Climate\\n|janhigh=9.8|febhigh=10.9|marhigh=14.2|aprhigh=19.4|mayhigh=23.6|junhigh=26.1|julhigh=29.9|aughigh=31.3|sephigh=27.5|octhigh=22.0|novhigh=16.7|dechigh=12.0\\n|janlow=1.2|feblow=2.1|marlow=5.0|aprlow=9.8|maylow=14.6|junlow=18.5|jullow=22.4|auglow=23.5|seplow=20.3|octlow=14.8|novlow=8.8|declow=3.8\\n|janprecip=59.7|febprecip=56.5|marprecip=116.0|aprprecip=133.7|mayprecip=139.7|junprecip=167.8|julprecip=156.2|augprecip=154.7|sepprecip=224.9|octprecip=234.8|novprecip=96.3|decprecip=57.9\\n|units=Metric\\n|description=Source: [https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html Japan Meteorological Agency ]}}\\nTokyo is classified as lying in the humid subtropical climate zone and has five distinct seasons.\\n\\n* '''Spring''' kicks off with plum blossoms in late February, followed by the famous cherry blossoms (''sakura'') in March\\u2013April. Parks, most famously [[Tokyo/Ueno|Ueno]], fill up with blue tarps and sozzled salarymen.\\n* '''Rainy season''' (''baiu'' or ''tsuyu'') in late May to June means a month of overcast skies and drizzle punctuated with downpours, with temperatures in the twenties.\\n* '''Summer''' really kicks off in July, with clear skies and brutal steam bath humidity. Daytime maximums tend to average around {{c|31}} with some days around {{c|34}} or higher, but the humidity can make those temperatures feel like {{c|34}} and {{c|41}}, respectively. Overnight lows average around {{c|25}} with some nights at {{c|27}} or higher, but even those temperatures given the humidity can feel like {{c|26}} and {{c|31}}. A short walk outside will leave you drenched in sweat, so this is probably the worst time of year to visit, and is best avoided if you have a choice. The one bright spot is the plethora of '''fireworks''', most notably the epic pyrotechnic extravaganza of the Sumidagawa Fireworks Festival on the fourth Saturday in July. Sunrises occur before 04:30, and sunset is always before 19:00, save for a week in late June.\\n* '''Fall''' from September onwards means cooler temperatures and fall colors. While southern Japan is regularly battered by typhoons this time of year, they mostly (but not always) veer clear of Tokyo.\\n* '''Winter''' is usually mild, with temperatures generally ranging from 0-10&nbsp;\\u00b0C, though occasional cold spells can send temperatures plummeting below zero at night, and indoor heating can leave much to be desired. Snow is rare, but on those rare occasions once every few years when Tokyo is hit by a snowstorm, much of the train network grinds to a halt. Sunsets occur before 16:30 in December, and sunrise is always before 07:00.\\nTokyo is hotter than surrounding areas due to the urban heat island.\\n\\n=== Visitor information ===\\n[https://www.gotokyo.org/en/index.html GO>TOKYO] is a  well-maintained sightseeing guide site for foreigners by the government. The site includes [https://www.menu-tokyo.jp/ a search page for restaurants with multi-language menus].\\n\\n==Talk==\\nIt's possible for English speakers to navigate their way around Tokyo without speaking any Japanese. Signs at subway and train stations include the station names in ''romaji'' (Romanized characters), and larger stations often have signs in Chinese and Korean as well. Though most people under the age of 40 have learned English in school, proficiency is generally poor, and most locals would not know more than a few basic words and phrases. Some restaurants may have English menus, but it does not necessarily mean that the staff will speak much English. Reading and writing comes much better though; many people can understand a great deal of written English despite not being able to speak it. That being said, staff at the main hotels and tourist attractions generally speak a decent level of English. While it is possible to get by with only English, it will nevertheless make your trip much smoother if you can learn some basic [[Japanese phrasebook|Japanese]].\\n\\n==Get in==\\nIn Japan, all roads, rails, shipping lanes and planes lead to Tokyo.\\n\\n===By plane===\\nTokyo ({{IATA|TYO}} for all airports) and the Kanto Region are served by two major airports. '''Narita International Airport''' ({{IATA|NRT}}) is Tokyo's main airport for international flights, but also serves a handful of domestic flights, particularly on low-cost carriers, and is convenient as a transit airport for those travelling between North America to most major East and Southeast Asian cities. '''Tokyo Haneda Airport''' ({{IATA|HND}}), which is much closer to central Tokyo and thus much more convenient and economical for getting into Tokyo and vicinity, is the main airport for domestic flights, but has also become a major hub for international flights as of the 2020s, particularly on routes that see heavy business traffic. There is also '''Ibaraki Airport''' ({{IATA|IBR}}) for some low-cost carriers, and the '''Ch\\u014dfu Airfield''', serving turboprop flights to the [[Izu Islands]].\\n\\n* {{go\\n| name=[[Narita International Airport]] | alt={{IATA|NRT}}; \\u6210\\u7530\\u56fd\\u969b\\u7a7a\\u6e2f ''Narita Kokusai K\\u016bk\\u014d'' | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=35.7649 | long=140.38845 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| image=3rd floor of Narita Terminal 2 200507.jpg | wikidata=Q36454\\n| content=Near the town of [[Narita]] nearly {{km|70}} east of Tokyo.

High speed ''Shinkansen'' services arrive here in the [[Tokyo/Chiyoda|Chiyoda]] ward.\\n}}\\n\\nFor all trains on the northern route, you can get off at [[Tokyo/Ueno|Ueno]], while trains on the western route call at [[Tokyo/Shinagawa|Shinagawa]]. Most non-Shinkansen services usually stops at [[Tokyo/Shibuya|Shibuya]] and [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] stations as well. Ueno and [[Tokyo/Ikebukuro|Ikebukuro]] stations connect to the northern suburbs and neighboring prefectures.\\n\\nThere are multiple departures every hour from Hakata station in [[Fukuoka]] to Tokyo, passing through [[Kyoto]], [[Osaka]] and [[Nagoya]], with three types of shinkansen trains. The ''Nozomi'' is the fastest, with trains taking just about 5 hours from Fukuoka and 2\\u00bd hours from Osaka. The ''Hikari'' makes more stops and takes 3 hours from Osaka, and the ''Kodama'' is the slowest, making all stops and reaching Tokyo from Osaka in 4 hours. The ''Nozomi'' trains require you to pay a supplement if you are using the [https://japanrailpass.net/en/ Japan Rail Pass].\\n\\nMultiple cities from the north offer direct Shinkansen services to Tokyo, including [[Akita]], [[Aomori]], [[Fukushima]], [[Hakodate]], [[Kanazawa]], [[Morioka]], [[Nagano]], [[Nagoya]], [[Niigata]], [[Sendai]], [[Toyama]], [[Yamagata]] and [[Yuzawa]]. All trains from these cities converge at \\u014cmiya in [[Saitama]], then run south to Ueno and Tokyo stations.\\n\\nAlthough Japan is dominated by fast Shinkansen trains there are still a couple of sleeper trains left: The ''Sunrise Izumo'' (\\u30b5\\u30f3\\u30e9\\u30a4\\u30ba\\u51fa\\u96f2) runs daily to Tokyo from [[Izumo]] while ''Sunrise Seto'' (\\u30b5\\u30f3\\u30e9\\u30a4\\u30ba\\u702c\\u6238) connects with [[Takamatsu]], the second largest city on the [[Shikoku]] island. Both trains run coupled together between Tokyo and [[Okayama]].\\n\\n===By car===\\nWhile you can drive into the city, it is really not recommended as the city can be congested, signs may be confusing and parking fees are astronomical. One option that should be considered is cheaper 24-hour parking lots in cities bordering Tokyo. For example, Yashio city's train station in [[Saitama (prefecture)]] has hundreds of spaces at \\u00a5500 per day, and is just minutes from Kita-Senju or Akihabara. A car of people can travel by highway at a fraction of the price of each person traveling by train, and can take the last leg by the cheapest train ticket into Tokyo.\\n\\nFor groups of 3-5 tourists traveling in Japan, a '''rental car''' to or from Tokyo to be returned at the agency counter in another city may prove to be a major chance for savings compared to train or air travel.\\n\\n===By thumb===\\nHitchhiking into Tokyo is pretty easy, but hitchhiking out is considerably more difficult. It's definitely possible for determined cheapskates though, see [[Hitchhiking in Japan]] for a detailed list of tested escape routes from the city.\\n\\n===By bus===\\nHighway bus services link Tokyo to other cities, resort areas and the surrounding prefectures. There are JR and private bus companies. Bus service may be cheaper, but the train is probably more convenient, especially with the JR pass.\\n\\nLong-distance buses use a number of terminals scattered throughout the city. At Tokyo Station, the main boarding point for buses is at the '''Yaesu Exit''' (\\u516b\\u91cd\\u6d32\\u53e3) on the east side. Some buses lines, including Keisei Bus, have moved to the new '''[https://bt-tokyoyaesu.com/en/top-en/ Bus Terminal Tokyo Yaesu]''' (\\u30d0\\u30b9\\u30bf\\u30fc\\u30df\\u30ca\\u30eb\\u6771\\u4eac\\u516b\\u91cd\\u6d32) which is across the street and can be accessed by underground passage from Tokyo Station.

The JR '''Chuo Line''' (orange {{Routebox entry|n|#ff4500|#ff4500|r=n|b=c|bcolor = black|}}', \\u4e2d\\u592e\\u7dda ''Ch\\u016b\\u014d-sen'') and '''Chuo-Sobu Line''' (yellow {{Routebox entry|n|#FFD700|#FFD700|r=n|b=c|bcolor = black|}}, \\u4e2d\\u592e\\u30fb\\u7dcf\\u6b66\\u7dda ''Ch\\u016b\\u014d-S\\u014dbu-sen'') run side-by-side, bisecting the Yamanote loop from [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] on the west to [[Tokyo (station)|Tokyo Station]] on the east. JR's other commuter lines, the Saikyo and Keihin-Tohoku, run off the rim of the Yamanote loop to the north and south. JR East has a good English information line, 050-2016-1603 or 03-3423-0111.\\n[[File:Tokyo metro map en.png|thumb|350x350px|Subway lines]]\\nTokyo has an extensive '''subway''' network, the oldest one in Asia dating back to 1927, with frequent trains, and these are primarily useful for getting around within the Yamanote loop. The '''[http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/index.html Tokyo Metro]''' runs nine lines: Ginza, Marunouchi, Hibiya, Tozai, Chiyoda, Yurakucho, Hanzomon, Namboku and Fukutoshin lines. '''[https://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/eng/ Toei]''' operates the Asakusa, Mita, Shinjuku, and Oedo lines. While the JR Yamanote Line is not a subway line, due to its importance as a major transportation artery in downtown Tokyo, it is usually featured on subway maps. In addition, there is a largely underground Rinkai Line, a private line which is operated by '''[http://www.twr.co.jp/en/tabid/233/Default.aspx Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit] (TWR)''', that passes through the island of [[Odaiba]].\\n\\nThe eight main '''private commuter railways''' radiate from the Yamanote loop out into the outlying wards and suburbs, and almost all connect through directly to subway lines within the loop (though many services terminate at stations on the Yamanote loop). The private lines are useful for day trips outside the city, and are usually slightly cheaper than JR. In addition, there are number of smaller private and \\\"third-sector\\\" (public-private partnership) lines - among these, the most well-known is arguably the '''[http://www.yurikamome.tokyo/ Yurikamome]''' which offers great views on the way to the island of [[Odaiba]].\\n\\nAnnouncements and signs are usually bilingual in Japanese and English, though in some areas frequented by tourists, signs in Korean and Chinese can also be seen. That said, staff working at the stations rarely speak much, if any English.\\n\\nKeep in mind that it is '''impolite to speak on the phone''' while aboard the train. Instead, you should send text messages while switching it to silent mode. It used to be a rule of etiquette to \\\"stand on the left so people in a hurry can pass you on the right when using the escalator\\\", however the current etiquette is to stand on both sides of the escalator without walking, because walking on the escalator can cause injuries.\\n\\n====Fares and hours====\\n[[Image:Series-E235-0 9.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Yamanote Line train]]\\nMost tickets and passes are sold from automated vending machines. These machines are '''cash only''' but give change. At many JR stations, there are purple-colored reserved seat ticket vending machines where you can purchase tickets for JR lines using a credit card. '''[http://www.japanrailpass.net/ JR trains are free with a Japan Rail Pass]'''.\\n\\n'''Smart cards''', instead of tickets, are convenient and highly recommended, because they allow you to ride trains without having to read the sometimes Japanese-only fare maps to determine your fare. The two smart cards sold in the Tokyo region are '''Suica''', which is sold by JR, and '''PASMO''', which is sold by the subway and private railway operators. Both cards can be used interchangeably, but refunds can only be processed by the respective operators that sell them. Smart cards from Japan's other regions can be used in Tokyo too; see [[Japan#Smart cards|Japan/Get around/Smart cards]] and [[Japan#Smart cards 2|Japan/Money/Smart cards]] for more details.  \\n\\nOtherwise, the following day passes are available:\\n* '''[https://www.tokyometro.jp/en/ticket/travel/index.html Tokyo Subway Ticket]''': 24-hr (\\u00a5800), 48-hr (\\u00a51200), and 72-hr (\\u00a51500) passes are available along with other combos.\\n* The '''[https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/pass/tokunai_pass.html Tokunai Pass]''' (\\u90fd\\u533a\\u5185\\u30d1\\u30b9) is a one-day pass good for travel on JR lines anywhere in the 23 wards of Tokyo (including the entire Yamanote Line and many stations surrounding it). It costs \\u00a5760, making it economical if you plan to make five or more train hops in one day. A variant is the '''Tokunai Free Kippu''' (\\u90fd\\u533a\\u5185\\u30d5\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u304d\\u3063\\u3077), which also includes a round-trip into Tokyo from stations in the surrounding prefectures. The '''Monorail And Tokunai Free Kippu''', which is good for two days and includes a round-trip from Haneda Airport to central Tokyo, costs \\u00a52,000.\\n* The '''[https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/pass/tokyo_free.html Tokyo Free Kippu]''' (\\u6771\\u4eac\\u30d5\\u30ea\\u30fc\\u304d\\u3063\\u3077) covers all JR, subway and city bus lines within the 23 wards. It costs \\u00a51,600 for one day and covers a number of areas that are not served by JR, such as Roppongi and Odaiba.\\n* The '''Holiday Pass''' (\\u4f11\\u65e5\\u304a\\u3067\\u304b\\u3051\\u30d1\\u30b9) covers the entire JR network in the Tokyo metropolitan area, including Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama and west Tokyo. It costs \\u00a52,720 for one day, and is only available on weekends, national holidays and during the Golden Week (Apr 29 to May 5), summer vacation (July 20 through Aug 31) and New Year (Dec 29 to Jan 3). But you will barely ever hit such high daily costs when travelling on Tokyo's public transport \\u2014 you will want to spend you time sightseeing and shopping, not sitting in the train.\\n\\n{{infobox|Who is making announcements in English?|In Tokyo, whichever train you take \\u2013 JR East, Tokyo Metro, Toei Subway, Tobu Railway, Seibu Railway, Odakyu Electric Railway, or Keisei Electric Railway \\u2013 you will hear English announcements in a similar voice. Actually, they are all announced by the same voice actor, Christelle Ciari.\\n\\nIn a Japanese interview she said: \\\"Most railway companies I worked for did not give me any instruction on how to pronounce the station names in English. So, I decided to read them in the original Japanese accent because I personally thought it was more natural and easier to comprehend for non-native speakers of English. The only exception was JR East, which instructed me to announce the station names in an American accent.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, you will hear \\\"Shibuya\\\" on Tokyo Metro while you will hear \\\"Sheebooyah\\\" on JR trains.\\n}}\\n\\nIf you are paying ''\\u00e0 la (smart) carte'', subway and train fares are based on distance, ranging from \\u00a5110 to \\u00a5310 for hops within central Tokyo. As a rule of thumb, Tokyo Metro lines are cheapest, Toei lines are most expensive, and JR lines fall somewhere in the middle (but are usually cheaper than Metro for short trips, i.e. no more than 4 stations). Many of the private lines interoperate with the subways, which can occasionally make a single ride seem unreasonably expensive as you are in essence transferring to another line and fare system, even though you're still on the same train. E.g. changing between Metro subway line and Tokyu private line amounts to paying the sum of each fare: minimum fare Metro \\u00a5160 + minimum fare Tokyu \\u00a5120 = \\u00a5280. In addition, several patterns of transfer are listed as \\\"Transfer Discount\\\", and the most famous one is \\u00a570 discount, that applies to a transfer between Tokyo Metro and Toei subway lines. When using Suica or PASMO, you can get all transfer discounts automatically. At some transfer stations, you may need to pass through a special transfer gate (both for paper tickets and PASMO/Suica) which is coloured orange &ndash; passing through the regular blue gate will not get you your transfer discount and if you have a paper ticket, you won't get it back. At some transfer points (e.g. Asakusa station) you may actually need to transfer on street level as the two stations (Metro Ginza Line and Toei Asakusa Line) are not physically connected and are about one block apart.\\n\\nIt pays to check your route beforehand. The '''[http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/smartphone/ Tokyo Subway Navigation for Tourists]''' by the Tokyo Metro, is a mobile app that allows you to plan subway and train travel from point A to point B, based on time, cost, and transfers. This app provides information for Tokyo only. For other apps or sites which cover the whole country, see the [[Japan#Get around|Japan]] page. <!-- Some major stations have terminals providing similar information. --><!-- uncomment if verified -->\\n\\nIf you can't figure out how much it is to the destination, you can buy the cheapest ticket and pay the difference at the Fare Adjustment Machine (''norikoshi'') at the end. Most vending machines will let you buy a single ticket that covers a transfer between JR, subway and private lines, all the way to your destination, but working out how to do this may be a challenge if you are not familiar with the system. When transferring between systems, whether paying with tickets or smart cards, use the '''orange transfer gates''' to exit. Otherwise, you'll be charged full fare for both separate parts of your trip, instead of the cheaper transfer fare.\\n\\nMost train lines in Tokyo run 05:00\\u201301:00. During peak hours they run about once every three minutes; even during off-peak hours it's less than ten minutes between trains. The only night when regular passenger services run overnight is for the New Year's Holiday on select lines.\\n\\nFor additional information for train travel in Japan generally, refer to the [[Japan#By rail|By rail]] section in the [[Japan]] article.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\n[[Image:Honjo taxi 2007-01.jpg|200px|thumb|A typical Tokyo taxi]]\\nTaxis are very pricey, but may be a value for groups of three or more. Also, if you miss your last train, you may not have another choice.\\n\\nFares were revised in 2022 in an effort to make taxis more attractive for short-distance trips, though longer trips are still very expensive. The fare for the standard taxis starts at \\u00a5500 for up to {{km|1.096}}, and goes up \\u00a5100 every {{convert|255|m|mi}} and for every 95 seconds in stopped or slow traffic. A 20% night surcharge is tacked on from 22:00-05:00, and tolls are added for any trips using the expressway.\\n\\nHere are some daytime fare examples based on Nihon Kotsu's taxi fare estimates (actual fares may vary):\\n* Tokyo Station to Akihabara Station \\u2013 {{km|3.0}}, \\u00a51,600\\n* Tokyo Station to Shinjuku Station (Bus Terminal) \\u2013 {{km|8.1}}, \\u00a54,300\\n* Tokyo Station to Haneda Airport Terminal 1 \\u2013 {{km|19.2}}, \\u00a510,200 including expressway fare\\n\\nTaxi rear left passenger doors are operated by the driver and open and close automatically. Don't open or close them yourself.\\n\\nDo not count on your taxi driver speaking English\\u2014or knowing more than the best-known locations, though most taxis have GPS \\\"car navi\\\" systems installed. The best and easiest thing to do is to prepare a map marked with where you want to go, and point it out on the map to the taxi driver. If you are staying at a hotel, they will provide a map. If possible, get a business card, or print out the address in Japanese of any specific places you wish to go. However, because in Japan streets are often unmarked, if the taxi driver does not have GPS he may not be able to do more than take you to the general vicinity of where you want to go. Also, taxis can get caught in traffic jams. No tips are expected or given.\\n\\n'''[https://www.nihon-kotsu-taxi.jp/en/ Nihon Kotsu]''' has a 24-hr English telephone number, 03-5755-2336, to call for a Nihon Kotsu taxi within Tokyo. There is a booking fee payable to the driver at the end of the trip: \\u00a5410 for an immediate hail or \\u00a5820 for an advance booking. If you already have a destination (or a few) in mind, the receptionist will electronically transmit the information to the driver so that you don't have to tell the driver yourself. If you are hailing a taxi right away, the English receptionist will inform you about your assigned taxi by color, company name and taxi number.\\n\\nA growing number of companies in Tokyo also offer taxi hails and ride requests by mobile apps including GO Taxi, DiDi and Uber. Your hotel's front desk can also call a taxi for you, subject to the same booking fees.\\n\\n===By ride hailing===\\nYou can use '''Uber''' to hail limousines and taxis for a \\u00a5500 surcharge, which may be worth it to bypass both the language barrier and potential payment hassles.\\n\\nStarting in April 2024 the Japanese government is planning to allow limited ride-sharing services under the supervision of taxi companies.\\n\\n===By car===\\nTokyo is a gigantic warren of narrow streets with no names, with slow-moving traffic and extremely limited and expensive parking. In this city with such an excellent mass transit system, you would need a good reason to want to drive around instead. While renting a car can make sense in Japan in some contexts (e.g., visiting a rural onsen resort), in general it is neither convenient nor economical to rent a car to get around metro Tokyo. Taxis are much more convenient if your budget allows it; walking or public transportation is much less expensive and given the difficulties of navigation and finding parking in popular areas, probably easier too.\\n\\nIf you do decide to plunge in and drive around by car, the main expressway serving Tokyo is the Shuto Expressway, abbreviated to '''[https://www.shutoko.co.jp/en/index/ Shutoko]''' (\\u9996\\u90fd\\u9ad8). The C1 Loop Line forms a circle around central Tokyo, similar in fashion to how the Yamanote Line does it by rail. But whereas the Yamanote Line charges \\u00a5140-200 for a single trip, driving a car onto the Shutoko in Tokyo costs '''\\u00a51320''' ''every time'' you enter the system (compact cars slightly cheaper), with additional tolls collected at various other locations. Vehicles equipped with Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) tags pay a cheaper rate based on the distance driven.\\n\\nDriving on the Tokyo Expressway at night can be a pleasant and beautiful experience as you whiz through and around the Tokyo nightlife. When driving at night you should '''exercise caution''' and obey speed limits: '''Street racing''' over the Shutoko at night became popular in the 80s and 90s and still happens today, albeit on a less frequent basis. Street racers often concentrate their driving on the C1 Loop Line and the Bayshore (more popularly known as the Wangan) Line. \\\"Competitors\\\" sometimes hang out at parking and service areas on the Shutoko, especially the large Daikoku Parking Area at the intersection of the Bayshore Line and the K5 Daikoku Line in [[Yokohama]].\\n\\n===By bus===\\n[[Image:Tobus B-K517 RH01temp.jpg|200px|thumb|Toei buses like this operate most of Tokyo's local bus routes.]]\\nThe few areas within Tokyo that aren't easily accessible by train are served by various bus companies. Buses operating within 23 wards of Tokyo have a fixed fare regardless of distance (\\u00a5210 on [https://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/eng/tips/bus_ride.html Toei buses] and \\u00a5220 on other private bus companies), which is paid upon boarding from the front door. The fares are not transferable; however most buses do accept '''Suica''' or '''PASMO''' fare cards (see above). Compared to the trains, the buses run much less frequently, carry fewer passengers, and are much slower. This makes them amenable to the elderly residents of Tokyo, but rather inconvenient for travelers, who will also have to deal with lack of information in English and sometimes very well hidden bus stops. Bus routes can be fairly complicated and are often not listed in detail at the bus stops; signs on the buses themselves often list only two or three main stops in addition to the origin and destination. Inside the bus the next stop is usually announced several times, sometimes by a taped voice and sometimes by a mumbling driver. Taped announcements in English are used on some lines, but are still rare. Nevertheless, north\\u2013south routes are useful in the western side of the city since train lines (Odakyu, Keio, Chuo, and Seibu) tend to run east\\u2013west.\\n\\nIn an attempt to provide some information about their buses to foreign visitors/residents, Toei Bus has a [http://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/bus/routes/index.html web site] that shows some of the main bus routes used to go to certain destinations in Tokyo. This information is provided in English and several other languages. You can download English route maps and apps at [https://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/eng/maps/ this site].\\n\\nIn addition, most private railway companies are accompanied by bus companies with corresponding names. They serve the areas outside of Yamanote Line loop, around their railway lines.\\n\\n====Sky Hop Bus====\\nWiller Express operates a hop-on, hop-off bus service called the '''[https://skyhopbus.com/ Sky Hop Bus]''' , which bills itself as \\\"the first open-top double decker bus in Japan\\\". At a charge of \\u00a51,800 for a 24-hour pass and \\u00a52,500 for a 48-hour pass (children half price), you can ride these buses and hop on and off as often as you wish. There are three bus routes that operate, all from the Marunouchi Building next to Tokyo Station: One route serves [[Tokyo/Asakusa|Asakusa]] and Tokyo SkyTree, the second runs to [[Tokyo/Roppongi|Roppongi]] and Tokyo Tower, and the third runs to [[Tokyo/Odaiba|Odaiba]]. The service only runs hourly, with departures from the Marunouchi Building between 10:20 and 18:30.\\n\\n===By boat===\\n[[Image:Tokyo Cruise Ship Himiko.jpg|250px|thumb|The Leiji Matsumoto-designed ''Himiko'' ferry]]\\nThe Tokyo Cruise Ship Company operates a series of [http://www.suijobus.co.jp/cruise/ '''Water Bus'''] ferries along the Sumida River and in Tokyo Bay, connecting [[Tokyo/Asakusa|Asakusa]], [[Tokyo/Hinode|Hinode]], [[Tokyo/Harumi|Harumi]] and [[Tokyo/Odaiba|Odaiba]].

Parts of Tokyo are surprisingly hilly, and it's a sweaty job pedaling around in the summer heat. Central Tokyo can still be covered fairly comfortably by bike on the weekends.

However, as the city is extremely safe even at night, walking in Tokyo can be a very pleasant experience. In some areas, walking can be much shorter than taking the subway and walking the transit (the whole Akasaka/Nagatacho/Roppongi area in the center is for instance very easily covered on foot).

There are also many language schools to help you work on your Japanese. Several universities in Tokyo cater to international students at the undergraduate or graduate level.\\n\\n===Universities===\\n\\n* '''[http://www.keio.ac.jp Keio University]''' (\\u6176\\u61c9\\u7fa9\\u587e\\u5927\\u5b66 ''Kei\\u014d Gijuku Daigaku'') \\u2014 Japan's top private university (unless you ask a Waseda student).

Certain nationalities are eligible for working holiday visas: for others, work permits can be very hard to come by without a job offer from a Japanese company. Consult your local Japanese consulate/embassy as far in advance as possible.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n[[Image:Souvenir shop, Asakusa, Tokyo, Japan.JPG|thumb|Kitsch-o-rama at the Nakamise arcade, [[Tokyo/Asakusa|Asakusa]]]]\\n\\nTokyo is one of the fashion and cosmetic centers in the Eastern world. Items to look for include electronics, funky fashions, antique furniture and kimono, as well as specialty items like Hello Kitty goods, anime and comics and their associated paraphernalia.\\n\\nCredit cards are widely accepted by major retailers, and there is a major government push to move towards cashless means of payment, including subsidies of 2-5% for doing so. \\\"Cashless\\\" here includes credit cards, transport cards like Suica/PASMO, Google/Apple Pay on your phone and a plethora of local apps. That said, '''cash remains king''' and many smaller shops and street stalls are still cash only. ATMs usually give out only \\u00a510,000 notes, but retailers are generally happy to make change. Most major bank ATMs now allow withdrawals from overseas banks with your usual ATM card.  Japan Post ATMs are bilingual and will allow you to withdraw money at the day's exchange rate without charging you any special fees.\\n\\nThe crime rate is very low, so don't be afraid of carrying around wads of cash as the Japanese do. The average Japanese citizen will carry a month's worth of expenses on them (around \\u00a540,000 give or take). See ''Buy'' under [[Japan#Buy|Japan]] for general caveats regarding electronics and media compatibility.\\n\\nThere are numerous convenience stores throughout Tokyo (such as Seven-Eleven, Lawson, and Family-Mart), which are open around the clock and sell not only food and magazines, but also daily necessities such as underwear and toiletries. Supermarkets are usually open until 22:00, while drugstores and department stores usually close at 21:00.\\n\\n===Anime and manga===\\n[[Tokyo/Akihabara|Akihabara]], Tokyo's Electric Town, is now also the unquestioned center of its ''otaku'' community, and the stores along Chuo-dori are packed to the rafters with ''anime'' (animation) and ''manga'' (comics).\\nAnother popular district for all things manga/anime is the [[Tokyo/Nakano|Nakano]] ward and its Broadway Shopping arcade. Check out the Mandarake shop for loads of used and rare mangas.\\n\\nThere has been an \\\"otaku boom\\\" in Akihabara. A lot of attention in particular was paid to the town thanks to the popular Japanese drama \\\"Densha Otoko\\\", a (true) love story about an otaku who saves a woman from a molester on a train and their subsequent courtship.\\n\\nAkihabara was previously known for its many live performances and ''cosplayers'', some of which had drawn negative attention due to extremist performers. These have become increasingly scarce following the ''Akihabara massacre'' in 2008, although girls in various maid costumes can still be seen standing along the streets handing out advertisement fliers to passers by for ''maid cafes''.\\n\\nIf you like a specific anime or character, Tokyo has no shortages of official stores dedicated to a specific character or anime series.\\n\\n===Antiques===\\nSerious collectors should head for the '''Antique Mall''' in [[Tokyo/Ginza|Ginza]] or the '''Antique Market''' in [[Tokyo/Omotesando|Omotesando]], which are collections of small very specialist shops (samurai armor, ''ukiyo-e'' prints, etc). However, the prices tend to be very high.\\n\\nLess wealthy shoppers can venture over to [[Tokyo/Suginami|Nishi-Ogikubo]], which sells scrolls of calligraphy (and some other similar items) for a few thousand yen.\\n\\nThe '''[http://www.kottouichi.jp/heiwajima.htm Antique Festival]''' (\\u5168\\u56fd\\u53e4\\u6c11\\u5177\\u9aa8\\u8463\\u796d\\u308a) is held over the weekend about 5-6 times a year at the Tokyo Ryutsu Center, on the Tokyo Monorail line, and is well worth a visit.\\n\\n===Books===\\nJinbocho is to used books what Akihabara is to electronics. It's clustered around the Jinbocho subway stop.\\nThe Blue Parrot is another shop at Takadanobaba on the Yamanote line, just two stops north of Shinjuku.\\n\\n===Cameras and electronics===\\nEver since Sony and Nikon became synonymous with high-tech quality, Tokyo has been a favored place for buying electronics and cameras. Though the lines have blurred since the PC revolution, each has its traditional territory and stores: [[Tokyo/Akihabara#Buy|Akihabara]] has the electronics stores, including a large number of duty-free shops specializing in export models, and [[Tokyo/Shinjuku#Buy|Shinjuku]] has the camera stores. Unfortunately, local model electronics are not cheap, but the export models are similar to what you'll pay back home. You can sometimes find cheap local models if you avoid big shops and check smaller retailers. It's also surprisingly difficult to find certain things e.g. games machines.\\n\\n===Fashion===\\n[[Tokyo/Shibuya|Shibuya]] and neighboring [[Tokyo/Harajuku|Harajuku]] are the best-known shopping areas for funky, youthful clothes and accessories. Almost without exception, clothes are sized for the petite Japanese frame.\\n\\nDepartment stores and exclusive boutiques stock every fashion label imaginable, but for global labels prices in Tokyo are typically higher than anywhere else in the world. The famous [[Tokyo/Ginza|Ginza]] and [[Tokyo/Ikebukuro|Ikebukuro]]'s giant '''Seibu''' and '''Tobu''' department stores are good hunting grounds. '''[[Tokyo/Roppongi|Roppongi Hills]]''' and the adjacent '''Tokyo Midtown''' have emerged as popular shopping malls for high-end shopping, with many major global and local Japanese brands. Other department stores in Tokyo are '''Isetan''', '''Mitsukoshi''', '''Marui''' (OIOI), '''Matsuzakaya''', '''Matsuya''' and '''Takashimaya'''. Mitsukoshi/Isetan group is Japan's biggest department store chain. Mitsukoshi's anchor store is in Nihonbashi, and is particularly known for its premier kimono department. '''Marui Men''' store in [[Shinjuku]] has eight floors of mid to high-end fashion for men only.\\n\\n===Kitchenware===\\nThe district for this is '''Kappabashi Street''' near [[Tokyo/Asakusa#Buy|Asakusa]], also known as \\u201cKitchen Town.\\u201d The street is lined with stores selling all kinds of kitchen wares \\u2014 this is where the restaurants of Tokyo get their supplies. It's also a great place to find '''cheap Japanese ceramics''', not to mention plastic food!\\n\\n===Music===\\nOchanomizu is to the guitar what Jinbocho is to used books. There, you'll find what must be the world's densest collection of guitar shops. Plenty of other musical instruments (though not traditional Japanese ones) are also available.\\n\\n===Souvenirs===\\nFor touristy Japanese knickknacks, the best places to shop are '''Nakamise''' in [[Tokyo/Asakusa|Asakusa]] and the '''Oriental Bazaar''' in [[Tokyo/Omotesando|Omotesando]], which stock all the kitschy things like ''kanji''-emblazoned T-shirts, foreigner-sized kimono, ninja outfits for kids and ersatz samurai swords that can be surprisingly difficult to find elsewhere. Both also have a selection of serious antiques for the connoisseur, but see also [[#Antiques|Antiques]] above.\\n\\nTokyo has more than 50 '''satellite shops''' (called \\\"antenna shops\\\" in Japan) for other prefectures and smaller municipalities around Japan - you can buy foods and souvenirs of rural areas without actually going there. Some of these shops have local cuisine restaurants too. They have an [https://www.jcrd.jp/antennashop/en/ official multilingual site] searchable by region and shop location in Tokyo.\\n\\n===Street markets===\\nBustling open-air bazaars in the Asian style are rare in Tokyo, except for [[Tokyo/Ueno|Ueno]]'s '''Ameyoko''', a legacy of the postwar occupation. '''Yanaka Ginza''' in the Shitamachi [[Tokyo/Taito|Taito]] district, a very nice example of a neighborhood shopping street, makes for an interesting afternoon browse.\\n\\nThere are often small flea and antique markets in operation on the weekend at major (and minor) shrines in and around Tokyo.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n[[Image:JP-13 Tsukishima monja street.jpg|thumb|Red lanterns beckoning customers in [[Tokyo/Chuo|Tsukishima]]]]\\nVisitors from Western countries may be surprised to find that despite its justified reputation for being an expensive city, eating out in Tokyo can be surprisingly affordable. While fine dining establishments in Tokyo can be some of the most expensive in the world, at the budget end of the spectrum, it is fairly easy to find a basic rice or noodle joint serving up meals starting from \\u00a5400; a price that is unmatched even by McDonald's or other fast food chains in the West.\\n\\nTokyo has a large quantity and variety of food. Department stores have food halls, typically in the basement, with food which is comparable to top delicatessans in other world cities (though mostly Japanese and Japanized foreign food). Some basements of train stations have supermarkets with free taste testers. It's a great way to sample some of the strange dishes they have for free.\\nTokyo has a large number of restaurants, so see the main [[Japan#Eat|Japan]] guide for the types of food you will encounter and some popular chains. Menus are often posted outside, so you can check the prices. Some shops have the famous plastic food in their front windows. Don't hesitate to drag the waiting staff out to the front to point at what you want. Always carry cash. Many restaurants will not accept credit cards.\\n\\nTokyo has tens of thousands of restaurants representing many cuisines in the world, though sometimes adjusted for local tastes, but it also offers a few unique local specialties. Within Japan, Tokyo cuisine is best known for 3 dishes: sushi, tempura, and unagi (freshwater eel). ''Nigirizushi'' (fish pressed onto rice), known around the world simply as \\\"sushi,\\\" in fact originates from Tokyo, and within Japan is known as ''Edo-mae zushi'' (Edo-style sushi). Another is ''monjayaki'' (\\u3082\\u3093\\u3058\\u3083\\u713c\\u304d), a gooey, cabbage-filled version of ''okonomiyaki'' that uses a very thin batter to achieve a sticky, caramelized consistency. It is originally from the Tsukishima area of [[Tokyo/Chuo|Chuo]] and today there are many restaurants near Asakusa offering monjayaki.\\n\\n===Budget===\\n[[Image:Tachigui 3012371228 534b1b8a46 o.jpg|thumb|Stand-and-eat (''tachigui'') noodle shop with ticket vending machine]]\\n\\nGo to a '''convenience store''' (''konbini''), there is one on every second corner. Really, the options may surprise you. You can get rice balls (''onigiri''), bread-rolls, salads, prepared foods (like ''nikuman'' and ''oden''), and drinks (both hot and cold) for \\u00a5100-150, ''bent\\u014d'' lunch boxes for around \\u00a5500 and sandwiches for \\u00a5250-350. At most convenience stores, microwaves are available to heat up your food for no additional cost. '''Supermarkets''' (''s\\u016bp\\u0101'') are usually cheaper and offer a wider choice, but are more difficult to find. (Try Asakusa and the sidestreets of Ueno's Ameyoko market for local\\u2014not big chain\\u2014supermarkets.). Supermarkets are a good place to buy discount food after 20:00. Also, '''\\u00a5100 shops''' (''hyaku-en shoppu'') have become very common, and most have a selection of convenient, ready to eat items. There are \\u00a5100 shops near most minor train stations, and usually tucked away somewhere within two or three blocks of the big stations. In particular, look for the green and red \\\"Lawson 100\\\" signs; these chains are essentially small grocery stores.\\n\\nAlso, look for ''bent\\u014d'' shops like Hotto-Motto (\\u307b\\u3063\\u3068\\u3082\\u3063\\u3068) and Kitchen Origin (\\u30ad\\u30c3\\u30c1\\u30f3\\u30aa\\u30ea\\u30b8\\u30f3) which sell take-out lunch boxes. They range in quality and cost, but most offer good, basic food at a reasonable price. This is what students and office workers often eat. In addition, COVID-19 forced many restaurants to sell takeaway lunchboxes to survive and the custom has stuck, adding more options to choose from.\\n\\nNoodle shops, curry shops, and bakeries are often the best option for people eating on the cheap. They are everywhere. The '''noodle bars''' on every corner are great for filling up and are very cheap at \\u00a5300\\u20131000. You buy your meal ticket from a vending machine at the door with pictures of the dishes and hand it to the serving staff. The one question you will typically have to answer for the counterman is whether you want '''soba''' (\\u305d\\u3070) (thin brown buckwheat) or '''udon''' (\\u3046\\u3069\\u3093) (thick white wheat) noodles. Some offer standing room only with a counter to place your bowl, while others have limited counter seating. During peak times, you need to be quick as others will be waiting. Pseudo Chinese-style '''ramen''' (\\u30e9\\u30fc\\u30e1\\u30f3) (yellow wheat and egg noodles) are a little more expensive and typically sold in specialist shops, with prices starting from \\u00a5400, but are typically served in very flavourful pork or chicken broth that has been boiled overnight. Tokyo is generally known among the Japanese for '''shoyu ramen''', in which soy sauce is used to add flavour to the pork broth.\\n\\nFast food is available just about everywhere, including many American chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Subway and KFC. But if you are visiting Japan from overseas, and wish to sample Japanese fast food, why not try MOS Burger, Freshness Burger, Lotteria, or First Kitchen? If you're looking for something more Japanese, try one of the local fast food giants, '''Matsuya''', '''Yoshinoya''', and '''Sukiya''', which specialize in donburi: a giant bowl of meat, rice, and vegetables, sometimes with egg thrown in for good measure, starting around \\u00a5450 for the flagship ''gy\\u016bdon'' (beef bowl). Another good option is ''oyako don'' (chicken and egg bowl, literally \\u201cmother and child bowl\\u201d), which the somewhat smaller chain ''Nakau'' specializes in. Drinking water or hot '''ocha''' (Japanese green tea) is usually available at no extra cost. There are also a number of tempura chains, with some budget options. More upscale but still affordable and rather more interesting, is '''Ootoya''', which serves up a larger variety of home-style cooking for under \\u00a51000. '''Yayoi-ken''' is a chain of eateries serving ''teishoku'', complete set meals: buy a ticket from the machine, and you'll get miso soup, main course (fish or meat, often with vegetables), rice (bottomless, just ask for refills), a small hunk of fresh tofu, pickles and tea, and still be left with some change from your \\u00a51000.\\n\\nRaw fish enthusiasts are urged to try ''kaitenzushi'' (conveyor belt sushi), where the prices can be very reasonable. Prices do depend on the color of the plate, however, and some items are very expensive, so be sure to check before they start to pile up.\\n\\nA great option for a quick bite or for groups is ''yakitori'' (grilled chicken) \\u2013 individual skewers are often below \\u00a5150.\\n\\nMany of the larger train and subway stations have fast, cheap eateries. Around most stations, there will be ample choices of places to eat, including chain coffeeshops (which often serve sandwiches, baked goods, and pasta dishes), yakitori places, and even Italian restaurants.\\n\\n===Mid-range===\\nThere are a great many excellent and affordable lunch choices in busier neighborhoods like Shibuya and Shinjuku, especially during the week \\u2013 expect to spend about \\u00a51000 (without drinks) for a meal.\\n\\nBy tradition the basement of almost any department store, including Mitsukoshi, Matsuzakaya, or Isetan, is devoted to the ''depachika'' (\\u30c7\\u30d1\\u5730\\u4e0b), a huge array of small shops selling all kinds of prepared take-out food. You can assemble a delicious if slightly pricey picnic here \\u2013 or, if you're feeling really cheap, just go around eating free samples! The very largest department stores are Tobu and Seibu in [[Tokyo/Ikebukuro|Ikebukuro]], but [[Tokyo/Shibuya|Shibuya]], [[Tokyo/Ginza|Ginza]] and in fact any major Tokyo district will have their fair share. [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] Station is home to several famous department stores, such as the Keio and Odakyu department stores. Many stores begin discounting their selections at about 19:00 each night. Look for signs and stickers indicating specific yen value or percentage discounts. You will often see half-price stickers which read \\u534a\\u5024 (''hanne''). This discounting is also common at supermarkets at the smaller stations, although the quality may be a notch or two down from the department stores, it's still perfectly edible.\\n\\nThe ubiquitous ''izakaya'', a cross between a pub and a casual restaurant, invariably serve a good range of Japanese dishes and can be good places to fill up without breaking the bank: in most, an evening of eating and drinking won't cost more than around \\u00a53000 per person. See [[#Drink|Drink]] for details.\\n\\nThere is a great variety of restaurants serving Tokyo's world-famous sushi at every price point, with fish fresh from [[Tokyo/East|Toyosu]], the world's largest fish market. It is possible to get sushi for as little as \\u00a5100/piece or less (at chain stores), or spend upwards of \\u00a510,000 (at elegant Ginza restaurants), but a typical spend is \\u00a53000\\u20134000, depending on selection (drinks extra). Usually ''omakase'' (chef's choice) gives a good deal and selection, to which you can add a piece or two a la carte if desired. A popular choice with tourists is a sushi breakfast at Tsukiji, former home of the fish market, particularly for one's jet-lagged first morning, or after a night out partying. Most sushi shops in the outer market of Tsukiji open at 8 or 9AM, though there are some 24-hour shops, and particularly popular are two small stores in the inner market that open before 6AM and feature market ambience and very long queues; see [[Tokyo/Chuo#Mid-range|Chuo: Mid-range dining]].\\n\\nThe best-known tempura chain is Tsunahachi, where depending on the store you can pay from below \\u00a51000 for lunch to over \\u00a56000 for dinner.\\n\\nA classic modern Japanese dish is ''tonkatsu'' (\\u201cpork cutlet\\u201d), and there are good Tokyo options; the fattier loin (\\u30ed\\u30fc\\u30b9 \\u201croast\\u201d) is generally considered tastier than the leaner fillet (''hire'' \\u30d2\\u30ec). The most famous restaurant is Tonki, right by Meguro station (1-1-2 Shimo-Meguro, Meguro-ku, Tokyo), serving a standard meal at about \\u00a51600, dinner only (from 16:00). While it is an institution with a loyal clientele (and frequent lines), and decidedly has atmosphere (similar to an established New York deli), the food gets mixed reviews, and is less succulent than other options \\u2013 an interesting experience, however. Next most famous is the chain [http://mai-sen.com/ Maisen] (\\u307e\\u3044\\u6cc9), which serves delicious if somewhat expensive tonkatsu (various varieties and seasonal options) at [http://mai-sen.com/shop/tokyo/ many locations in Tokyo], most notably at their flagship shop in Aoyama by Omotesand\\u014d station (Jingumae 4-8-5, closing at 19:00). The top-end dish is Okita Kurobuta (Berkshire pork by Mr. Okita), at \\u00a53,800 for a meal, though they have cheaper options. A modern option is [http://www.butagumi.com/ Butagumi], at Nishi-Azabu 2-24-9 (west of Roppongi station), serving a variety of premium pork brands expertly prepared.\\n\\nTokyo also has a large number of Korean restaurants, generally midrange, and many ''yakiniku'' (grilled meat) restaurants are Korean-influenced.\\n\\n===Splurge===\\nTokyo has the world's highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants, with prices to match. For upmarket Japanese eats, [[Tokyo/Ginza|Ginza]] is guaranteed to burn a hole in your wallet, with [[Tokyo/Akasaka|Akasaka]] and [[Tokyo/Roppongi|Roppongi Hills]] close behind. Top-end restaurants are primarily Japanese, with a few French. Tokyo is widely regarded as the spiritual home of a fine style of sushi known as ''edomae-zushi'' (\\u6c5f\\u6238\\u524d\\u5bff\\u53f8). Besides sushi, Tokyo's fine dining scene also includes Japanese contemporary, tempura and ''kaiseki''. You can limit the damage considerably by eating fixed lunch sets instead of dinner, as this is when restaurants cater to people paying their own meals instead of using the company expense account. However, Tokyo's fine dining scene is notoriously inaccessible to foreign visitors, as most establishments do not accept reservations from new customers; you will need to be introduced by one of their regular diners in order to dine there. That said, it is possible to book a spot at some of these establishments through your hotel concierge if you do so many months in advance, though only the most expensive luxury hotels will have the necessary clout to do this. Also keep in mind that many fine dining establishments do not accept credit cards, and you will be expected to pay for your meal ''in cash''.\\n\\nThere are four 3-star sushi restaurants in Tokyo, of which the most famous internationally is [https://www.sushi-jiro.jp/english/ Sukiyabashi Jiro]{{Dead link|date=December 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}, due to the movie ''Jiro Dreams of Sushi;'' reservations must be made on the 1st day of the preceding month, as they book up that day, and dinner is from \\u00a530,000. The cheapest of these top sushi restaurants is Sait\\u014d Sushi (+81 3 3589 4412), where a small lunch can be had for as little as \\u00a55,000.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n[[Image:Roppongi night.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Tokyo/Roppongi|Roppongi]] at night, with Tokyo Tower in the distance]]\\n\\nThe party never stops in Tokyo (at least in the karaoke bars), and you will find good little bars and restaurants everywhere.\\n\\nThe most Japanese way to spend a night out as an individual or in a small group would be at Japanese-style watering holes called ''izakaya'' (\\u5c45\\u9152\\u5c4b), which offer food and drink in a convivial, pub-like atmosphere (see [[Japan#Drink|Japan]] for details). Cheaper chain ''izakaya'' like '''Tsubohachi''' (\\u3064\\u307c\\u516b) and '''Shirokiya''' (\\u767d\\u6728\\u5c4b) usually have picture menus, so ordering is simple, even if you don't know Japanese &ndash; but don't be surprised if some places have Japanese only touchscreen ordering systems.\\n\\nAnother common option, which is often unbelievable to non-Japanese ears, is \\u201call you can drink\\u201d (''nomih\\u014ddai,'' \\u98f2\\u307f\\u653e\\u984c), where you can drink all you want from a fixed menu for 90 minutes or 120 minutes. This is aimed at group parties, and is generally paired with a meal, often \\u201call you can eat\\u201d (''tabeh\\u014ddai,'' \\u98df\\u3079\\u653e\\u984c), often in a private room. Receiving the items ordered will depend on how often your servers decide to bring out these items, which means you may be \\\"throttled\\\" to an extent, and may feel less than a true \\\"all you can drink/eat\\\" experience. This depends on the establishment. There are also a number of cheap bars where you can get a drink for \\u00a5300 or even cheaper.\\n\\nTokyo's most distinctive drink is [[w:Hoppy (beverage)|Hoppy]] (''hoppi,'' \\u30db\\u30c3\\u30d4\\u30fc), a virtually non-alcoholic beer-flavored drink (0.8% alcohol), which is drunk by mixing with sh\\u014dch\\u016b (at 25%) at a 5:1 ratio, yielding an about 5% alcohol drink, essentially a substitute beer. This is available in older izakaya and has experienced a retro revival of late, though it is not particularly tasty. Another distinctively Tokyo drink is Denki Bran (\\u96fb\\u6c17\\u30d6\\u30e9\\u30f3, \\u201celectric brandy\\u201d), a herb-flavored brandy available (to drink in or in bottles) at the Kamiya bar (\\u795e\\u8c37\\u30d0\\u30fc) in [[Tokyo/Asakusa|Asakusa]], right at the main intersection by the metro station.\\n\\nThe major brands of beer are widely available, typically \\u00a5500\\u2013800 per glass or bottle, but microbrews and foreign beer are only rarely available and often very expensive. You're generally better off getting bottles of microbrews at speciality stores. [https://www.70beersontap.com/ Popeye] in Ry\\u014dgoku is a rare exception, with 70 beers on tap! Another popular choice is Beer Station at Ebisu, serving a variety of Yebisu beers and matching German food.\\n\\nFor a splurge on a beverage or two, Western Shinjuku's Park Hyatt Tokyo houses the New York Bar on level 52. Providing stunning views day and night across Tokyo, it was also the setting for the movie ''Lost in Translation''. Cocktails here start around \\u00a51400 \\u2013 single malt whiskies are upwards of \\u00a52000. Amazing cocktails, served in \\u201ctasting flights\\u201d of 4 or 6 drinks, are made by [http://www.genyamamoto.jp/ Gen Yamamoto] at his bar in Azabu-J\\u016bban, at about \\u00a56000 for 6 drinks (a la carte cocktails are available in larger pours for \\u00a51600\\u20131800).\\n\\nVisiting clubs and western-style night spots can get expensive, with clubs and live houses enforcing weekend cover charges in the \\u00a52000\\u20135000 bracket (usually including a drink coupon or two).\\n\\nIf you're new in town, [[Tokyo/Roppongi|Roppongi]] has establishments which specialize in serving foreigners &ndash; but it's also overflowing with foreigners, hostesses, and 'patrons' who will continually hassle you to visit their gentlemen's clubs, where drinks cost \\u00a55000 and up. Many Japanese and foreigners avoid this area, preferring the clubs and bars in [[Tokyo/Shibuya|Shibuya]] instead, or trendy [[Tokyo/Ginza|Ginza]], [[Tokyo/Ebisu|Ebisu]], [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] or [[Tokyo/Toshima|Ikebukuro]].\\n\\n'''[http://pub-hub.com/ HUB and 82 Ale House]''', a chain of British-style cash-on-delivery pubs, has branches near most major stations and is reasonably priced and popular among foreigners and Japanese alike. Other British/Irish pubs can be found in Roppongi, Shinjuku and Shibuya. Expect to pay around \\u00a51000 a pint, although happy hours can reduce this by a few hundred yen.\\n\\nIn [[Tokyo/Shibuya|Shibuya]], the bar area behind 109 and next to Dogenzaka (\\\"Love Hotel Hill\\\") has a large number of clubs. Unlike those in Roppongi, these clubs have entrance fees, but clubs without entrance fees often hassle you all night to buy drinks which ends up just as expensive and without people who are actually there to enjoy the music. [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] is home to Kabukich\\u014d, Japan's largest red-light district. Also in Shinjuku is the gay bar district of Shinjuku-nichome. A little further from the city center are [[Tokyo/Shimokitazawa|Shimokitazawa]], [[Tokyo/Koenji|Koenji]] and [[Tokyo/Nakano|Nakano]], full of good bars, restaurants and \\\"live houses\\\" offering underground/indie music popular with students and 20/30-somethings.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n<!-- Please add individual lodgings to district pages, not here -->\\nThere are thousands of hotels in the Tokyo area, ranging from cheap to very expensive. They are distributed throughout the city, with some of the high end and the low end almost everywhere. Many Western-style hotels, especially those affiliated with American hotel chains, have English-speaking staff.\\n\\nFor long-term accommodation, be prepared to splurge as Tokyo's real estate prices are among the highest in the world, and apartments in the area are typically very cramped. Many locals actually live in the neighbouring cities and commute to Tokyo for work every day due to the astronomical rents in Tokyo, and one-way commuting times can often last more than 2 hours.\\n\\n===Budget===\\nMuch of Tokyo's budget accommodation can be found in the [[Tokyo/Taito|Taito]] area, especially [[Tokyo/Asakusa|Asakusa]] and [[Tokyo/Ueno|Ueno]]. But if you are not afraid of being a little bit off-center, you may have a look to the surroundings: [[Yokohama]], etc.\\n\\nMost of the cheap accommodation in the Taito area (near JR Minami-senjuu) has curfew times around 22:00 to 23:00, so be sure to check that in advance if it bothers you. One hotel that does not have a curfew is [http://www.kangaroohotel.jp/ Kangaroo Hotel], rooms starting at \\u00a53200. There's also [http://www.spocom.net/pc/hoteiya_e.shtml Economy Hotel Hoteiya], rooms starting at \\u00a52700.\\n\\nCapsule hotels are generally the cheapest option. They may be reluctant to play host to foreigners as there are quite a few rules of behavior which may be difficult to explain; see the [[Japan#Sleep|Japan]] article for the full scoop. Most capsule hotels are men-only. '''[http://www.capsuleinn.com Akihabara Capsule Inn]''' is among the very few to have women-only floors.\\n\\n24-hour comic book library/internet cafes known as manga kissa, are common in Tokyo. This is one of the cheapest ways to crash if you miss your last train and need to wait for the early morning transit service to get started. No bed, but you have a comfy chair and a PC and/or DVDs if you can't sleep. Later in the evening, karaoke boxes often offer discounted prices for the whole night, they usually have a couch you can sleep on. Most of these cyber cafes charge \\u00a51500\\u20132500 for 8 hours.\\n\\nOne of the cheapest ways to stay can be also a youth hostel, prices start at \\u00a51200, e.g. in the [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] area.\\n\\nIf you are ''truly'' on a budget, it is possible to go homeless and [[Urban camping in Japan|camp]] in public parks, for free. You can do this with a tent, if you want to carry one, and you can also sleep on benches, as exhausted salarymen and students do. It's also possible to do this all over Japan, It's called ''nojuku'' in Japanese.\\n\\n===Mid-range===\\nThere is a wide range of choices in hotels while at Tokyo, most of the hotels are rated 3 stars or more. Tokyo is among most of the other cities when it comes to hotels because their services and hotel locations are the best of the best.\\n\\nKeep an eye out for what is called a '''business hotel'''. The rooms are usually tiny, but they are near stations and rates start from around \\u00a56000. Staff may speak minimal English, but it's not too hard to figure out. These are the best options for solo travelers. Affordable chains found throughout Tokyo include '''[https://www.tokyustay.co.jp/e/ Tokyu Stay]''', which offers free internet access and breakfast, '''[https://www.toyoko-inn.com/eng/index Toyoko Inn]''', '''[https://www.solarehotels.com/brand/chisun/ Chisun]''' and '''[https://sotetsu-hotels.com/sunroute/ Sunroute]'''.\\n\\nTokyo has some self-proclaimed ''ryokan'' (Japanese inns) that cater largely to foreign tourists, mostly concentrated around [[Tokyo/Ueno|Ueno]] and [[Tokyo/Asakusa|Asakusa]]. While not as opulent as the real thing, they offer a sample of Japanese home life at affordable rates.\\n\\nJapan's infamous '''love hotels''' can be a reasonable (and interesting) option in Tokyo. Shibuya's [[Tokyo/Shibuya#Sleep|Dogenzaka]] (\\\"Love Hotel Hill\\\") offers the widest selection in the city. If you're really going to spend the night, be sure to check in for a \\\"stay\\\" rather than a \\\"rest\\\". Be warned that some love hotels (at least around Shinjuku) have a 'No Japanese, no stay' policy, presumably to avoid confusion over billing; others lock you into your room until you pay into a slot by the door to leave.\\n\\n===Splurge===\\n{{infobox|The Three Great Houses|Most large cities have a [[grand old hotel]], but Tokyo has three: the Imperial ([[Tokyo/Chiyoda#Sleep|Chiyoda]]), the Okura ([[Tokyo/Minato#Sleep|Minato]]) and the New Otani ([[Tokyo/Chiyoda#Sleep|Chiyoda]]).  In Japanese, they're known as the Three Great Houses (\\u5fa1\\u4e09\\u5bb6 ''gosanke'') after the three houses of the Tokugawa clan that founded Edo, today's Tokyo, and ruled Japan for centuries.}}\\n\\nYou can spend a fortune on accommodation in Tokyo. Most of the high-end international chains are well represented. Particular concentrations of luxury hotels can be found in western [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] (including the Park Hyatt Tokyo, featured in ''Lost in Translation''), near [[Tokyo/Chiyoda|Tokyo Station and Marunouchi]] (including the legendary Imperial Hotel) and in [[Tokyo/Akasaka|Akasaka]].\\n\\nBeware of hotels marketing themselves as being at \\\"Tokyo Bay\\\". At best, this means you'll be in or near the [[Tokyo/Odaiba|Odaiba]] district, built on reclaimed land half an hour away from the city center; at worst, you'll end up somewhere on the coast of the adjacent prefecture of [[Chiba]], which is handy for visiting [[Tokyo Disneyland]] but quite inconvenient for touring Tokyo itself.\\n\\n==Connect==\\n\\n===Free Wifi===\\n\\n*'''[http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/tips/connectivity/freewifi/ Tokyo Metro]''' About 100 metro (not JR) stations have free Wi-Fi, with SSID \\\"Metro_Free_Wi-Fi\\\" or \\\"Toei_Subway_Free_Wi-Fi\\\", email registration necessary.\\n*'''[http://freespot.com/ FreeSpot]''' FreeSpot offering free wireless Internet access, check out their maps of service areas\\n*'''[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nttbp.jw2&hl=en_US Japan Wi-Fi auto-connect]''' app for free Wi-Fi spots all over Japan.\\n\\n===Internet cafe===\\nGood connections are available at Internet cafes everywhere. Expect to pay \\u00a5400\\u2013500 per hour. \\\"Gera Gera\\\" is a popular chain. Paid WiFi service is also taking off in Tokyo with reasonable coverage &ndash; at a price. WiFi services are probably not convenient for those just visiting.\\n\\nIt is possible to find wireless connections in fast food outlets like McDonald's or Mos Burger. You also have a good chance to find a connection in one of the numerous coffee shops. Just look for a wireless connection sign in the front window or computers within the shop. Free wireless is not nearly as prevalent in Japan as it is in the West.\\n\\n===Mobile phones===\\nForeigners are forbidden from buying disposable \\\"burner\\\" mobile phones and SIM cards, but it is possible to rent mobile phones, SIM Cards, and portable wifi hotspots.\\n\\n*'''[http://www.rentafonejapan.com/ Rentafone Japan]''' Rents basic mobile phones with texting, calling, and mobile internet service.\\n*'''[https://www.econnectjapan.com eConnect]''' Rents \\\"WiFi-To-Go\\\" mobile hot spots, for \\u00a5 432 - 1,080 / day and prepaid data-only SIM Cards lasting as long as 30 days.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\nTokyo is probably one of the safest cities you will ever visit, and Japan in general is one of the safest countries in the world. Most people, including female travellers, would not encounter any problems walking along the streets alone at night. Street crime is extremely rare, even late at night. However, '''\\\"little crime\\\" does not mean \\\"no crime\\\"''', and common sense should still be applied as anywhere in the world. Often the biggest risk is travellers taking Japan's visibly apparent lack of crime too close to heart and doing things they would never do back home.\\n\\nThe most common crime is sexual harassment on crowded trains, pressed up against each other, hands wander. This is more of a local problem as westerners are considered more aggressive and would stick up for themselves. The best way to deal with any wandering hands is to yell \\\"''Chikan!''\\\" which is the Japanese term for \\\"pervert\\\". There are railway police offices inside major railway stations in Tokyo, and their locations can be found [https://www.keishicho.metro.tokyo.jp/sodan/madoguchi/chikan.html here]. You may alternatively dial the police at {{phone|+81-03-3581-4321}} to report sexual harassment.\\n\\nTokyo's main slum area is the San'ya (\\u5c71\\u8c37) area, near Minami-Senju station, with large numbers of mostly male homeless people. It is well off the main tourist trail, but has been gaining popularity among backpackers for its cheap accommodation. However, as many of these hostels are designed for homeless day labourers, the hygiene conditions are often less than satisfactory. While violent crime is still rare, sexual harassment of women is more common than elsewhere in Tokyo, so women might want to avoid travelling there alone.\\n\\nSmall police stations, or '''''k\\u014dban''''' (\\u4ea4\\u756a), can be found every few blocks, and provide community policing. If you get lost or need assistance, by all means go to them; it's their job to help you! They have great maps of the surrounding area, and are happy to give directions. They may, however, have difficulties with English, so some knowledge of the Japanese language helps. Staffing of k\\u014dbans is usually limited, and should you need to report a crime, you should lodge them at your nearest police station (\\u8b66\\u5bdf\\u7f72), which are marked with a circle with a cross on maps and signs.\\n\\nTake usual precautions against pickpockets in crowded areas and trains. Also, theft is more likely to occur in hangouts and bars popular with travellers and non-residents.\\n\\nThe red-light and nightlife districts can be a bit seedy, but are rarely dangerous. Some small, back-street drinking establishments in red-light districts have been known to charge extortionate prices. Similar problems exist in the seedier clubs in Roppongi, where it may be wise to check cover charges and drink prices in advance. Never follow touts, as they are likely to lead you to dodgy establishments that charge extortionate prices. Touting is illegal in Japan, so you can call the police if they get persistent.\\n\\nStill in a jam? Call '''[http://www.telljp.com/ Tokyo English Life Line]''', tel. 03-5774-0992, daily 09:00-23:00.\\n\\nIf you make it as far out as the [[Izu Islands]], visitors to [[Miyakejima|Miyakejima Island]] are required to carry a gas mask, due to volcanic gases. Those in poor health are advised against travelling to the island. In addition, Tokyo, like the rest of Japan is at risk for [[earthquakes]].\\n\\n==Cope==\\n===Addresses===\\nIn Tokyo, like other Japanese cities, a place's address is nearly useless for actually getting there. Most roads have no name. Addresses are written in order from largest to smallest; an example address written as \\u4e38\\u30ce\\u51851\\u4e01\\u76ee5-6 or \\u4e38\\u30ce\\u51851-5-6 would be the neighborhood of Marunouchi (\\u4e38\\u30ce\\u5185), district (''ch\\u014dme'') 1, block 5, house 6. (Addresses are usually written in English as \\\"Marunouchi 1-5-6\\\", or \\\"1-5-6 Marunouchi\\\".) Additional numbers may be appended for the floor or room number.\\n\\nNumbering for districts, blocks, and houses is often not sequential; numbers are usually assigned as buildings are built, chronologically, or based on distance from the city center. Small signs near street corners display the ward/neighborhood and district in Japanese (such as \\u4e38\\u30ce\\u51851\\u4e01\\u76ee, Marunouchi 1-ch\\u014dme); they often include the block number, but sometimes not, in which case the signs are very unhelpful since a district could be a dozen or more blocks. A building's entrance will usually show the block and house number (such as 5\\u20136, sometimes written 5\\u756a6\\u53f7), but not the district.\\n\\nTo find your address, make your way to the ward, then start looking for the signs near street corners. The ''ch\\u014dme''s may be numbered in a logical way \\u2014 ''ch\\u014dme'' 4 next to ''ch\\u014dme'' 3, or they may not be. Once you locate the correct ''ch\\u014dme'', start looking for your block. Again, block 5 may be close to block 4. Then walk around the block looking for building 6. ''Ganbatte''! (Do your best and good luck.)\\n\\n===Healthcare centres===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Tokyo Metropolitan Health and Medical Information Center | alt= | url=https://www.hokeniryo.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/iryo/iryo_hoken/gaikokujin/interpreter/himawari.html | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+81 3-5285-8181 | tollfree=\\n| hours=09:00-20:00 | price=\\n| content=Information about medical institutions as well as about the medical and health insurance system in Japan.

In [[Helsinki]], aurorae occur about once a month, and are usually masked by light pollution or clouds. Aurorae seen further outside of the auroral belts may also be much less vivid, with fewer colours.\\n\\n=== Cruise ships ===\\nA luxurious way to see the lights is to take a [[cruise ship]] along the coast of [[Norway]] or [[Alaska]], or toward [[Antarctica]] for the Southern Lights, in the appropriate season. Cruises tend to be expensive, but the costs may be quite reasonable compared to flying to a good site on land and paying for accommodation and tours there. Viewing the Lights by just strolling on deck after dinner is much more convenient than being driven somewhere to stand in the snow, and the chance of encounters with dangerous wildlife is lower. \\n\\nThere may be problems with this; not all cruise lines run in winter and it is ''extremely'' difficult to get good photos from a moving ship when the subject requires long exposures, as the lights generally do. If the cruise is not specially for aurora viewing, chances are that light pollution from the ship itself is an issue.\\n\\n=== In flight ===\\n\", \"\\nIn particular, [[Tasmania]] and the [[South Island]] of New Zealand are places where the Lights can be observed several times a year.

Because of the skew towards the Eastern Hemisphere, it is not reasonable to expect any viewing from [[Patagonia]], and it's not that likely you'll see them even from the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The best place to view them would be Antarctica's [[Ross Sea]] via [[Macquarie Island]] (Australia) or the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]]. The best viewing would be from the boat itself. The closest island to the auroral belt that has a good range of tourist accommodation is [[Stewart Island]]. \\n\\nThere is day trip flight from [[Sydney]] to see the Southern Lights (A$1,295+).\\n\\nAll of the considerations about maximizing your chances of seeing the Northern Lights apply equally to seeing the Southern Lights, except that the Southern Hemisphere seasons should be taken into account in regards to maximizing the hours of darkness.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Astronomy]]\\n\", \"\\nThe Lights are generally fairly dim, but sometimes bright enough that reading a newspaper on a moonless night is possible. Both brightness and how far from the poles they are visible vary according to three factors: time of year, an 11-year cycle in solar activity, and solar storms. These are discussed in more detail later.\\n\\nLight pollution around cities can mask a dim aurora display. Therefore, areas at least 30 km from cities are preferred for viewing. The trick is to get far enough from cities for good viewing (generally easy, since most northern areas are not heavily populated) ''without'' taking undue risks in a climate that can easily kill you.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Map auroral oval mostly canada.png|thumb|200px|Northern Lights oval, 2007]]\\n\\nContrary to intuition, seeing the Northern Lights isn't just a matter of heading north.

In the east, the road connects Muang Khua to the northernmost border crossing with [[Vietnam]], near the Vietnamese city of [[Dien Bien Phu]]. Buses leave daily from Dien Bien Phu's bus station early in the morning. Travel time is around 5 hours, including customs.\\n\\nBuses from [[Muang Xay]] stop 2&nbsp;km away on the west side (35,000 kip for the bus and 5,000 kip for a collective tuk-tuk to the town centre).\\n\\n===By boat===\\nMuang Khua is about halfway between [[Phongsali]] in the north and the backpacker-popular village of [[Muang Ngoi Neua]], with connections further south to [[Luang Prabang]].\\n\\nTickets can be bought from the boat dock, half an hour before the boat leaves. From the visitors centre, with the market in front of you, turn left and take the first street right. It is at the end of this road (you will have walked past three guesthouses and be on a downward slope). The boat to [[Muang Ngoi Neua]] and [[Nong Khiaw]] leaves at 09:30. Tickets to [[Muang Ngoi Neua]] (written Muang Ngoy on the boat dock sign) are 100,000 kip. Tickets to [[Nong Khiaw]] (an hour south of Muang Ngoy) are 120,000 kip. Boats may not leave if there are not enough people (~12 people per boat) (Oct 2013) unless they are chartered. Do not expect the boats to operate more often than once in a few days.\\n\\nDue to the Ou River 3 Hydro Power Station you have to change the boats and go with a songthaew around the dam/power plant.

Schematically, those to the west of Paris ([[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], [[Saint Cloud (France)|Saint Cloud]], [[Levallois]], [[Versailles]], Poissy, Rueil-Malmaison) are wealthy residential communities, even if some more middle class suburbs can be found. Those to the north are poorer communities, and very ethnically diverse. Those to the south are a mix of rough and poor neighbourhoods alongside very affluent communities. Finally, those to the east are usually lower-middle class mingled with a few upper-middle class communities.\\n\\n==Understand==\\nParis sits on the River Seine, in north-central France. Around 2.2&nbsp;million people live in the city of Paris, but this only represents the urban core within the ''Boulevard P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique''. There are some 10 million in the wider ''M\\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris'' (814 km<sup>2</sup>) and almost 13&nbsp;million people living in the metropolitan area, making this one of Europe's largest.\\n\\nDue to high expectations, a tight schedule, language barriers and large crowds and long lines at certain attractions during high season, the city might disappoint some visitors. Foreign visitors who have an idealized view of Paris might be shocked by the typical challenges of visiting any large city; crime, traffic noise, pollution, garbage, and relatively high costs. In the worst case, visitors might experience the ''Paris syndrome''; a psychological state of delusion.\\n\\nTo enjoy the wonders of Paris, make realistic plans. The amounts of attractions and landmarks is overwhelming; visiting only the most famous ones (which can be overcrowded during major holidays) takes more than a week. The city also has more to offer for people who take time for a calm stroll along the backstreets. If your time in the city is short, be selective, and save some attractions for your next visit.\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Paris je t'aime | alt= | url=https://parisjetaime.com/eng/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2024-01-30\\n| content=The website of the tourist office.\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=SPOT24 | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=101 quai Jacques Chirac, Paris 15th | lat= | long= | directions=Metro: Bir-Hakeim (line 6); RER: Champ-de-Mars\\u2014Tour Eiffel (line C); V\\u00e9lib': station 7023\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=Daily 10:00-18:00 | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=2024-01-30\\n| content=The City of Paris welcome centre also has an exhibition and shop.\\n}}\\n\\n===History===\\nParis started life as the Celto-Roman settlement of ''Lutetia'' on the \\u00cele de la Cit\\u00e9, the island in the Seine now occupied by the ''Cath\\u00e9drale de Notre Dame''. It takes its present name from the name of the dominant [[Celts|Gallo-Celtic tribe]] in the region, the ''Parisii''. At least that's what [[Roman Empire|the Romans]] called them, when they showed up in 52 BCE and established their city ''Lutetia'' on the left bank of the Seine, in what is now called the \\\"Latin Quarter\\\" in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe Romans held out here for as long as anywhere else in the Western Empire, but by 508 CE they were gone, replaced by '''Clovis of the [[Franks]]''', who is considered by the French to have been their first king. Clovis' descendants, aka the Carolingians, held onto the expanded Lutetian state for nearly 500 years through Viking raids and other calamities, which finally resulted in a forced move by most of the population back to the islands which had been the centre of the original Celtic village. The Capetian Duke of Paris was voted to succeed the last of the Carolingians as [[Kingdom of France|King of France]], ensuring the city a premier position in the medieval world. Over the next several centuries Paris expanded onto the right bank into what was and is still called ''le Marais'' (The Marsh). Quite a few buildings from this time can be seen in the [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe medieval period also witnessed the founding of the Sorbonne. As the \\\"University of Paris\\\", it became one of the most important centres for learning in Europe\\u2014if not the whole world, for several hundred years. Most of the institutions that still constitute the University are found in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]], and [[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th arrondissements]].\\n\\nIn the late 18th century, there was a period of political and social upheaval in France and Europe, during which the French governmental structure, previously a monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy, underwent radical change to forms based on Enlightenment principles of nationalism, citizenship, and inalienable rights. Notable events during and following the revolution were the storming of the Bastille (in what is now the [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissement]]), and the rise and fall of Napoleonic France. Out of the violent turmoil that was the French Revolution, sparked by the still known ''Passion des Fran\\u00e7ais'', emerged the enlightened modern day France.\\n\\nThe Paris of today was built long after the Capetian and later the Bourbon Kings of France made their mark on Paris with the ''Louvre'' and the ''Palais Royal'', both in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]. In the 19th century, Baron von Hausmann set about reconstructing the city, by adding the long straight avenues and replacing many of the then existing medieval houses, with grander and more uniform buildings.\\n[[File:Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|210px|The Eiffel Tower]]\\n\\nNew wonders arrived during ''La Belle \\u00c9poque'', as the Parisian golden age of the late 19th century is known. Gustave Eiffel's famous tower, the first metro lines, most of the parks, and the streetlights (which are partly believed to have given the city its epithet \\\"the city of light\\\") all come from this period. Another source of the epithet comes from ''Ville Lumi\\u00e8re'', a reference not only to the revolutionary electrical lighting system implemented in the streets of Paris, but also to the prominence and aura of ''Enlightenment'' the city gained in that era.\\n\\nThe twentieth century was hard on Paris, but thankfully not as hard as it could have been. Both world wars took a heavy toll on the city's inhabitants, but at least Hitler's order to burn the city was ignored by the German General von Choltitz, who was quite possibly convinced by a Swedish diplomat that it would be better to surrender and be remembered as the saviour of Paris, rather than its destroyer. Following the war, the city recovered quickly at first, but slowed in the 1970s and 1980s when Paris began to experience some of the problems faced by big cities everywhere: pollution, housing shortages, and occasionally failed experiments in urban renewal.\\n\\nHowever, post-war Paris enjoyed considerable growth as a multi-cultural city, with new immigrants from all corners of the world, especially ''La Francophonie'', including most of [[North Africa|northern]] and [[West Africa|western Africa]] as well as [[Indochina]]. These immigrants brought their foods and music, both of which are of prime interest for many travellers. Immigration and multi-culturalism continues in the 21st century with a marked increase in the arrival of people from Latin America, especially [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], and [[Brazil]]. In the late 1990s, it was hard to find good Mexican food in Paris, whereas today there are dozens of possibilities from lowly ''taquerias'' in the outer ''arrondissements'' to nice sit-down restaurants on the boulevards. \\n\\nNevertheless, Paris remains a French city; bistros, baguettes, high-end fashion, art, accordions, Hausmann architecture, and all the stereotypes (whether good or bad) of France are alive and well in Paris. People from all over France flock to Paris for work, study, partying, and everything in between. After all, this IS the capital of France, so anything pertaining to France can be found here.\\n\\nThe 21st century has also seen vast improvements in the general livability of Paris, with the mayor's office concentrating on reducing pollution and improving facilities for soft forms of transportation including a huge network of cycle paths, larger pedestrian districts and new metro lines. Visitors who normally arrive car-less are the beneficiaries of these policies as much as the Parisians themselves, although tensions and doubts have emerged over the actual benefits of those measures.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Metric\\n| janhigh =   7\\n| febhigh =   9\\n| marhigh =   12\\n| aprhigh =   16\\n| mayhigh =   20\\n| junhigh =   23\\n| julhigh =   25\\n| aughigh =   25\\n| sephigh =   22\\n| octhigh =   16\\n| novhigh =   11\\n| dechigh =   7\\n| janlow =   3\\n| feblow =   3\\n| marlow =   5\\n| aprlow =   8\\n| maylow =   11\\n| junlow =   14\\n| jullow =   16\\n| auglow =   17\\n| seplow =   14\\n| octlow =   9\\n| novlow =   6\\n| declow =   4\\n| janprecip = 54\\n| febprecip = 44\\n| marprecip = 49\\n| aprprecip = 53\\n| mayprecip = 65\\n| junprecip = 55\\n| julprecip = 63\\n| augprecip = 43\\n| sepprecip = 55\\n| octprecip = 60\\n| novprecip = 52\\n| decprecip = 59\\n}}\\n\\nParis has an oceanic climate with moderately cold winters and warm summers.

TER are sometimes slower, stopping at almost all stations. TER tickets bought at the train station are valid two months from the date indicated on the ticket, as long as you travel in the right fare period (\\\"p\\u00e9riode bleue\\\", the cheapest, \\\"p\\u00e9riode blanche\\\", for high-demand hours). There is no seat reservation, so arrive early enough or you may have to travel without a seat.\\n* '''Intercit\\u00e9s''': A bundling of the former ''Intercit\\u00e9s'', ''T\\u00e9oz'', and ''Lun\\u00e9a'' train categories. There are two kinds: the regular trains, which are priced the same as the TER and the trains you'll find yourself on if you have a [[Eurail]] or [[InterRail]] pass and don't want to pay extra for reservations, and the ''trains \\u00e0 r\\u00e9servation obligatoire'', which require a reservation and are priced differently from the regular ''Intercit\\u00e9s'' trains.\\n* '''Intercit\\u00e9s de nuit''': Overnight trains from destinations to and from south of France, including [[Latour-de-Carol]], [[Lourdes]] and [[Cerb\\u00e8re]] via [[Toulouse]].\\n* '''TGV''': The world-famous French high-speed trains (''Trains \\u00e0 Grande Vitesse'') run very frequently to the southeast [[Nice]] (5-6 hr), Marseille (3 hr) and [[Avignon]] (2.5 hr), the east [[Geneva]] (3hr) or [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], [[Dijon]] (1 hr 15 min) and [[Strasbourg]] (1 hr 45 min), the southwest [[Bordeaux]] (3 hr), the west [[Rennes]] (2 hr) and the north [[Lille]] (1 hr).

Reservations are obligatory.\\n* '''ICE''': German [[high-speed train]]s, operating most services between Paris and [[Frankfurt]].\\n* '''Thalys''': A high-speed train service running daily to/from the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]. Though it can be a bit expensive compared to normal trains, tickets can be cheap enough if you buy in advance. On-board service is usually very good.\\n* '''Eurostar''': The Eurostar service connects Paris with [[London]] St. Pancras directly and [[Brussels]] indirectly, as well as many other destinations indirectly through the various west European rail services.

Not surprisingly, traffic jams are significantly worse during French school holidays.\\n\\nThe multi-lane highway around Paris, called the ''P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'' (BP), is probably preferable to driving through the center. Another beltway nearing completion; ''L'A86'' (also {{European road|FR|A|186}} and A286) loops around Paris about 10&nbsp;km further out from the ''P\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique''. A third, incomplete beltway is much further out and called ''La Francilienne'' (N104).\\n\\nIt is advised not to drive within Paris and to be wary in the metropolitan area. It is better to drive to a suburban train station with a parking lot and then use the train to continue your trip throughout Paris. Most of Paris' roads were created long before the invention of automobiles. Traffic inside the city tends to be heavy, especially at rush hour; driving, however, may be rather easy and efficient in the evening. Parking is also difficult. Furthermore, the medieval nature of parts of the city's street system makes it very confusing, and traffic will almost never allow one to stop or slow down to get one's bearings. If you are unfamiliar with the streets and still insist on driving in the city, make sure you have a navigator in the passenger seat with you. However, Paris does have several iconic boulevards that have multiple lanes, form the backbone of the city\\u2019s road network, and are useful if you do choose to bring a car \\u2014 and are tourist attractions onto themselves.\\n\\nIn Paris, there are many car rental agencies offering a large number and wide range of vehicles for rental. Additionally, there are numerous car rental agencies located off-site which provide free airport transfers from their location and may offer lower prices well.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\n=== By public transport ===\\n[[File:Navigo Easy.jpg|thumb|\\n\\nNavigo Easy Travel Card\\n\\n]]Paris has an excellent public transport system that spans every inch of the city. It is well-known for its ''M\\u00e9tro'' (short for ''Chemin de fer m\\u00e9tropolitain'', \\\"Metropolitan Railway\\\"), ''RER'' (short for ''R\\u00e9seau Express R\\u00e9gional'', \\\"Regional Express Network,\\\"), and ''Transilien'' rail networks. The M\\u00e9tro, RER and  Transilien are complemented by a large network of trams and buses.\\n\\n[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en \\u00cele-de-France Mobilit\\u00e9s] is the authority that controls and coordinates the different transport companies operating in the \\u00cele-de-France region, including Paris. The website and app can be used to plan journeys, track services, and purchase tickets.\\n\\n[https://www.ratp.fr/en RATP] operates the M\\u00e9tro, trams, buses, and about half of the RER A and B. [https://www.transilien.com/en SNCF] operates the rest of the RER, as well as the Transilien. Both companies take the same tickets, so the difference is of little interest for most people except in case of strikes. For example, RATP may strike without SNCF doing so or the other way around.\\n\\nThe M\\u00e9tro and RER move staggering numbers of people into, out of, and around Paris (6.75 million people per day on average), and most of the time in reasonable comfort. However, certain lines are operating at or near capacity, sometimes being so full that you'll have to let one or two trains pass before being able to board. If you can help it, avoid M\\u00e9tro lines 1, 4, and 13 and RER line A and B during rush hours as these are the most congested lines in the system.\\n\\nStrikes, breakdown and construction are regular occurrences on the Paris public transit system. Generally during a strike, the M\\u00e9tro operates with reduced service and some RER lines may stop operating altogether. Visit the [https://www.ratp.fr/en RATP] or [https://www.transilien.com/en SNCF] websites for information on which routes are affected. Beware that real-time traffic information and construction announcements are often available only on the French-language version.\\n\\n==== By M\\u00e9tro ====\\n[[File:Carte M\\u00e9tro de Paris.svg|thumb|250x250px|M\\u00e9tro Map]]\\nLook for the M\\u00e9tro stations, marked with a large \\\"M\\\" sign or with an old-styled sign saying \\\"M\\u00e9tropolitain\\\".\\n\\nThere are 16 M\\u00e9tro lines (''lignes'') (''1''-''14'', ''3bis'', and ''7bis'') on which trains travel all day at intervals of a few minutes. Trains usually come 2\\u20133 minutes apart during rush hour and 5\\u201310 minutes apart during other times, depending on the line. The service starts on each end of every line at 05:30, and the last metro arrives on each end at 01:15 (service ends an hour later on Friday and Saturday nights, and the day before a holiday), stopping at all stations on the line. Some lines have rare trains that terminate at an intermediate station; if that happens, get off the train with the rest of the crowd and board the next train on the same track or on the other side of the platform (the driver will usually make an announcement in French). Lines 7 and 13 have a fork, so if you take line 13 north of ''La Fourche'' or line 7 south of ''Maison Blanche'', make sure to board the train for the correct destination which is indicated by a lit arrow on the sign in the middle of the platform and on colour-coded binders in each carriage. Times for trains can be seen on an electronic scroll board above the platform. Scheduled times for first and last trains are posted in each station on the centre sign. Generally, except for early and late hours, travellers should not worry about specific Metro train times; just get to your station and take the next train.\\n\\nThe lines are named according to the names of their terminal stations (the end of the line). If you ask the locals about directions, they will answer something like: take line number ''n'' towards \\\"end station _\\\", change at \\\"station _\\\", take the line ''nn'' towards \\\"end station _\\\" etc. The lines are also colour-coded.\\n\\nChanging metro lines might be difficult at times for visitors travelling to or from the airport or train stations with heavy luggage or those with impaired mobility, especially at major metro intersections. Moving from one platform to another generally involves walking up and down multiple flights of stairs. Very few stations have elevators (only the newest line 14 is wheelchair-accessible at all stations). Only the busiest ones have escalators. It might be a good idea to check out the bus routes and timings and see if one can find a convenient bus connection.\\n\\nEach station displays a detailed map of the surrounding area with a street list and the location of buildings (monuments, schools, places of worship, etc.,) as well as exits for that particular metro. Maps are located on the platform if the station has several exits or near the exit if there is only one exit.\\n\\nExcept for M\\u00e9tro 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, and 14, the doors will not open automatically. In such a case, there are handles or buttons located both inside and outside the train that you have to push or unlatch in order to open the door. Many locals may try to squeeze into the trains after the alarm has sounded to signal the closing of the doors. While one can occasionally pass through on lines with a driver, the automatic doors on M\\u00e9tro 1 and 14 will continue to close despite the presence of a limb or article of clothing. It is strongly advised to wait for the second train than to chance being caught between the doors.\\n\\nSome larger stations have secondary entrances, where there is no ticket booth. These are labelled ''voyageurs munis de billets'' (passengers with tickets).\\n\\n==== By RER ====\\n[[File:RER A - Gare Noisiel.JPG|thumb|Information on service OKRE, last stop Torcy]]There are five commuter train lines that cross Paris: RER A, B, C, D, and E. RER trains run at intervals varying from about 3 minutes (RER A) to 6 minutes (RER D), and stop at every station '''within''' Paris. Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend.\\n\\nRER trains will stop at every station within Paris (zone 1), but may skip stations outside Paris, so if you're going to the suburbs make sure your RER stops where you need! Information about the stops to be made by the next incoming train is presented on a separate board also hanging from the ceiling.\\n\\nRER trains do not have publicly announced numbers unlike the rest of SNCF network; the four letter codes (COHI, ELAO, QYAN, VICK, etc.) take the role of the train numbers instead; the first letter indicates the station where the train terminates, and the other three indicate the route and stops. Each line has its own nomenclature. You can look up what these codes mean on information panels in the station, but the easiest and fastest way is often to check the information screens along the platforms.\\n\\n==== By Transilien ====\\nThe rest of the regional train network, called \\\"Transilien\\\", departs from the main train stations (Lyon for line R, Est for line P, Nord for lines H and K, St-Lazare for lines J and L, Montparnasse for line N) and La D\\u00e9fense (line U). Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend. The Transilien is marginally less crowded than the RER and the Metro.\\n\\n==== By tram ====\\nMost tourists will not encounter the trams as they run only on the outskirts of the city. Trams T3a & T3b go nearly three quarters of the way round the city at the edge. Tram line 7 connects Orly Airport with RER line C; it is cheap but not fast.\\n\\n==== By bus ====\\nA bus ride is interesting if you want to see more of the city. All stops have a name and are clearly marked on the street. At complex intersections, stops usually have a map that lets you know where other lines stop and if applicable where to find a M\\u00e9tro entrance. If more than one line stops, wave to the driver to let them know you want to board. All buses have a schematic map of the line on display with all stop names, bus connections and major street names. Electronic displays inside each bus tell riders its current position and what stops remain, but don't overly rely on them as they don't always work.\\n\\nSince the M\\u00e9tro is primarily structured around a hub-and-spoke model, there are some journeys for which it can be quite inefficient. In these cases it is worth seeing if a direct bus route exists, despite the complexity of the bus network.\\n\\n''Noctilien'' night buses run regularly through the central hub at Chatelet to outlying areas of greater Paris. There is also a circle line connecting the main train stations. It pays to know one's Noctilien route ahead of time in case one misses the last M\\u00e9tro home. Women travellers should probably avoid taking the Noctilien on their own to destinations outside Paris.\\n\\n==== Fares ====\\n\\nA Navigo Travel Card is required to use public transport in Paris city and the wider \\u00cele-de-France region. The card can be loaded with a variety of fares (e.g. 10 M\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Tickets). It cannot be loaded with credit like other cards around the world (e.g. \\u20ac50). The card needs to be validated at the start of a journey and when transferring to a new tram or bus. It does not need to be validated at the end of a journey unless required to exit a fare gate.\\n\\nThe following cards are available to obtain:\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\"\\n|+Navigo Travel Cards\\n!Navigo in English\\n!Navigo in French\\n!Price\\n!Locations to obtain/load\\n!Fares available to load\\n|-\\n|[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/smartphone '''Navigo on Smartphone''']\\n|''Navigo sur Smartphone''\\n|Free\\n|\\n\\u00cele-de-France Mobilit\\u00e9s app,<br>\\nBonjour RATP app,<br>\\nSNCF Connect app,<br>\\nApple Wallet app,<br>\\nSamsung Wallet app\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Ticket,<br>\\nBus-Tram Ticket,<br>\\nAirports Ticket,<br>\\nRoissyBus Ticket,<br>\\nDay Ticket,<br>\\nWeek Ticket,<br>\\nMonth Ticket,<br>\\nParis Visite Ticket\\n|-\\n|[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/navigo-easy-travel-card '''Navigo Easy Travel Card''']\\n|''Passe Navigo Easy''\\n|\\u20ac2\\n|\\nTicket Windows,<br>\\nTicket Machines\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Ticket,<br>\\nBus-Tram Ticket,<br>\\nAirports Ticket,<br>\\nRoissyBus Ticket,<br>\\nDay Ticket,<br>\\nParis Visite Ticket\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/navigo-decouverte-travel-card Navigo D\\u00e9couverte Travel Card]'''\\n|''Passe Navigo D\\u00e9couverte''\\n|\\u20ac5\\n|\\nTicket Windows,<br>\\nTicket Machines\\n|\\nDay Ticket,<br>\\nWeek Ticket,<br>\\nMonth Ticket\\n|}\\nThe following fares are available to load:\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\"\\n|+Fares in Paris and \\u00cele-de-France\\n!Fare in English\\n!Fare in French\\n!Price\\n!Validity\\n!Rules\\n|-\\n|[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/metro-train-rer-ticket '''M\\u00e9tro-Train-RER Ticket''']\\n|''Billet M\\u00e9tro-Train-RER''\\n|\\u20ac2.50\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular\\n|\\nValid for 120 minutes,<br>\\nNot valid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nIncludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/bus-tram-ticket Bus-Tram Ticket]'''\\n|''Billet Bus-Tram''\\n|\\u20ac2\\n|\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable\\n|\\nValid for 90 minutes,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nIncludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/paris-region-airports-ticket Airports Ticket]'''\\n|''Billet A\\u00e9roports''\\n|\\u20ac13\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nOrlyval\\n|\\nValid for 120 minutes,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nIncludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/orlybus-and-roissybus-tickets RoissyBus Ticket]'''\\n|''Billet RoissyBus''\\n|\\u20ac13\\n|\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid for 90 minutes,<br>\\nValid to/from Charles de Gaulle airport,<br>\\nExcludes transfers\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-day-ticket Day Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Jour''\\n|\\u20ac12\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable\\n|\\nValid any day,<br>\\nNot valid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable up to 6 days in advance\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-weekly-ticket Week Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Semaine''\\n|\\u20ac31.60\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable,<br>\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid from Monday to Sunday,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable from Friday to Thursday\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-monthly-ticket Month Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Mois''\\n|\\u20ac88.80\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable,<br>\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid from 1st to 31st,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable from 20th to 19th\\n|-\\n|'''[https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/paris-visite-ticket Paris Visite Ticket]'''\\n|''Forfait Paris Visite''\\n|\\u20ac29.90\\n|\\nM\\u00e9tro,<br>\\nRER,<br>\\nTransilien,<br>\\nFunicular,<br>\\nTram,<br>\\nBus,<br>\\nCable,<br>\\nOrlyval,<br>\\nRoissyBus\\n|\\nValid any day,<br>\\nValid to/from/between airports,<br>\\nObtainable in advance\\n|}\\nPaper tickets were completely discontinued in 2025.\\n\\nTicket inspectors roam the network and show no mercy to tourists pleading ignorance.

As well as providing easy, cheap transport to much of central Paris, excellent photo opportunities abound. You can buy a day or 3 day ticket and hop on and off the boat as needed. The boats take a circular route from the Eiffel Tower, down past the Louvre, Notre Dame, botanical gardens then back up the other bank past Mus\\u00e9e d'Orsay.  [http://www.batobus.com/ Batobus] offers a regular shuttle service between the main tourist sights (closed Jan); other companies such as the famous [http://www.bateaux-mouches.fr Bateaux Mouches] offer sightseeing cruises.\\n\\n===By taxi===\\n\\n{{Infobox|To stop a taxi|If the sign is green, the cab is available, if it is red, the cab is busy, if it is off, the cab is off}}\\n\\nTaxis are comparatively cheap especially at night when there are no traffic jams to be expected. There are not as many as one would expect, and sometimes finding a taxi can be challenging. In the daytime, it is not always a good idea to take a taxi, as walking or taking the metro (''See: M\\u00e9tro'') will often be faster. If you know you will need one to get to the airport, or to a meeting, it is wise to book ahead by phone.\\n\\nThe initial fare is \\u20ac2.40 and the meter increases by around \\u20ac1.10 each kilometer and around 50 cents each minute spent at red lights or in traffic jams. Fares are fixed by the city law and every driver complies with them. Fares vary according to the day of the week, the hour of the day and the area you're crossing. If you call a taxi, the meter starts when you call and not when you get in. You should expect a \\u20ac5 to \\u20ac10 fare on the meter when the taxi arrives after you call it.\\n\\n'''Remember''' if a taxi is near a 'taxi station', they're not supposed to pick you up ''except'' at the station where there may be people waiting for a taxi. Taxi stations are usually near train stations, big hotels, hospitals, and large crossings.\\n\\nThere are a number of services by which you can call for taxis or make a reservation in advance. The two largest fleet are Taxis G7 and Taxis Bleus:\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis G7 | url=http://www.taxisg7.fr | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 47 39 47 39 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis Bleus | url=http://www.taxis-bleus.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 891 70 10 10 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\nAs in many other cities a taxi can be difficult to stop; you may have to try several times. When you do get a taxi to stop, the driver will usually roll down his window to ask you where you want to go. If the driver can't (or doesn't want to) go where you want, he might tell you that he's near the end of his work day & can't possibly get you where you want before he has to go off-duty.\\n\\nThere is a \\u20ac6.40 minimum (2012) on all taxi rides, mandated by city law, but the meter does not show this amount, which can result in being asked to pay more than the metered amount on short rides. In Paris taxis are required by law to charge for the trip with a meter, charging a flat rate is illegal, except from/to Charles de Gaulle airport (\\u20ac50 from the right bank of the Seine, \\u20ac55 from the left bank) and Orly airport (\\u20ac35 from the right bank, \\u20ac30 from the left bank). Frequently the taxi driver will not want to drive you all the way to the doorstep, but will prefer to let you out a block or so away if there are one or more one-way streets to contend with. Try to look at this as a cost-savings rather than an inconvenience. You should pay while still seated in the cab as in New York and ''not'' through the front window London style. A tip is included in the fare price; If you're especially satisfied with the service, you can give something (basically 10%), but you don't ''have'' to. There is an extra charge for baggage handling.\\n\\nThe driver will not let you sit in the front seat (unless there are 3 or 4 of you, which is a rare case usually expedited by more money). Taxi-drivers come in all types, some nice, some rude, some wanting to chat, some not. Smoking in taxis is generally not allowed, however it might be that the taxi driver himself wants a cigarette in which case the rule might become flexible. Many drivers prefer that you avoid using your cellphone during the ride; if you ''do have'' to, make an apologizing gesture & sound, and do make a '''short''' call.\\n\\nIf for any reason you wish to file a complaint about a Paris taxi, take note of the taxi's number on the sticker on the left hand backseat window. Beware of illegal taxis (see the 'Stay Safe' section).\\n\\n===By car===\\n\\nIn a word: '''don't'''. It is generally a very bad idea to rent a car to visit Paris. Traffic is very dense during the day, and parking is, on average, exceedingly difficult and expensive. This is especially true in areas surrounding points of interest, since many of these are in areas designed long before automobiles existed. A majority of Parisian households do not own cars, and many people who move to the city find themselves selling their cars within a month or two.\\n\\nThat said, driving may be an option for going to some sights in the suburbs such as Vaux-le-Vicomte castle or the castle and city at [[Fontainebleau]], or for starting to other places in France. You may prefer to rent from a location outside Paris proper.\\n\\nTraffic rules in Paris are basically the same as elsewhere in France, with the exception of having to yield to incoming traffic on roundabouts. However, driving in dense traffic in Paris and suburbs during commute times, can be especially strenuous. Be prepared for traffic jams, cars changing lanes at short notice, and so on. Another issue is pedestrians, who tend to fearlessly jaywalk more in Paris than in other French cities. Be prepared for pedestrians crossing the street on red, and expect similar adventurous behaviour from cyclists. Remember that even if a pedestrian or cyclist crossed on red, if you hit him, you (in fact, your insurance) will have to bear civil responsibility for the damages, and possibly prosecution for failing to control your vehicle. Note that the speed limit in Paris is 30 km/h in almost every street, besides a few large avenues clearly marked as such. There are no stop signs in the city center.\\n\\nParis has several orbital roads. There is a series of boulevards named after Napoleonic-era generals (''Boulevard Mass\\u00e9na'', ''Boulevard Ney'', and so forth), and collectively referred to as ''boulevards des Mar\\u00e9chaux''. These are normal wide avenues, with traffic lights. Somewhat outside of these is the ''boulevard p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'', a controlled-access road with grade separation. The ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique int\\u00e9rieur'' is the inner lanes (going clockwise), the ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique ext\\u00e9rieur'' the outer lanes (going anti-clockwise). Despite the looks, the ''p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique'' is not an ''autoroute'': the speed limit is 70 km/h and, very unusually, incoming traffic has the right of way, at least theoretically (presumably because, otherwise, nobody would be able to enter during rush hour).\\n\\n=== By chauffeur ===\\nKnown as car services or livery cabs, these cars are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares. You need to book them before they can pick you up. They are flat rate rather than metered (''ask for the fare before getting in''), and there are two types of licence: the \\\"Grande Remise\\\" that allows the car & driver to pick-up & drop-off passengers anywhere in France, and the \\\"carte verte\\\" that allows pick-up & drop-off in the department or region where the company is based. The Grande Remise cars have a GR on their front plate. They provide more service than a normal cab.\\n* Shared shuttle: You have to share the shuttle with other customers. They can be delayed since the shuttle needs to pick up other customers and perhaps drop them off before you, but they are cheaper than a private shuttle.\\n* Private shuttle: Will pick you up on-time and drop you off directly to the address specified in the booking.\\n\\n=== By motorcycle ===\\nParis is an incredibly open city, with its many \\\"Grands Boulevards\\\" and monuments with large open spaces around make it a city perfect to be explored and viewed by scooter or motorbike. Be warned that scooter/motorbike is by far the mode of transportation with the most casualties in Paris: half of victims of a collision were riding one, although they only account for about 2% of the traffic. When you're riding a scooter or motorbike in Paris, even if you see others doing so, it is not allowed to \\\"lane-split\\\" between the rows of cars waiting in traffic. At the red lights, even though a lot of scooter and motorbike drivers do not respect it, don't forget to pay attention to the bike designated area: you are not allowed to use them, and doing so is equivalent to failing to respect the red light (\\u20ac135 fine). Parking-wise there are plenty of ''deux roues'' (two wheel) parking spots all over the city. Again, even though you may see plenty of scooters or motorbikes parked on the sidewalk, it is forbidden to do so. The city of Paris has dramatically increased the number of vehicles fined every day (\\u20ac35), some of them even being towed away (at your own expenses).\\n\\n*{{do\\n| name=Paris By Scooter | url=http://parisbyscooter.com/ | email=paris@parisbyscooter.com\\n| address=(Scooter always delivered to your hotel) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 6 28 35 39 30 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=08:00-21:00 | price=From \\u20ac60\\n| content=All Vespa scooter rentals and Paris guided City tours include the collect and picked up from, your hotel in Paris.\\n}}\\n*{{listing\\n| name=Left Bank Scooters | url=http://www.leftbankscooters.com | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=Scooter delivered to your hotel\\n| phone=+33 6 78 12 04 24 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=08:00-20:00 | price=From \\u20ac60\\n| content=Scooter rental that is delivered to, and picked up from, your hotel in Paris.

Most speak English well. A simple \\\"''Bonjour Monsieur / Madame, parlez-vous anglais?''\\\" should suffice.}}\\n\\nRenting a bike is a very good alternative over driving or using public transport and an excellent way to see the sights. Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than almost any town or city in the United States. The French are very cognizant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. Paris hasn't always been the easiest place to get around by bike, but that is no longer the case. The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well, in establishing some separated bike lanes, creating a bikesharing system, and allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riverside paths which are perfect for cycling. The Paris bike network now counts over 150&nbsp;km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist. In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-hours of the day when traffic is lighter. Do remember to bring a good map, since there is no grid plan to speak of and almost all of the smaller streets are one-way.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Paris Walking 101|To get a great orientation of the city on foot while seeing many of Paris' major sights, you can do a West to East walk along the [[Axe Historique]] from the Arc de Triomphe to \\u00cele de la Cit\\u00e9 (Notre Dame). This walk takes about 1-2 hours without any stops. Start at the top of the Champs Elys\\u00e9es (at the Arc de Triomphe) and begin walking down the Champs Elys\\u00e9es towards Place ('square') de la Concorde.\\n*On the way towards the obelisk on the square, you'll see the major stores and restaurants of Paris' most famous avenue.\\n*Once you've passed the main shopping area, you'll see the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais to your right.\\n*At Place de la Concorde, you'll be able to see many of Paris' major monuments around you. In front of you is the Tuileries, behind you is the Champs-Elysees and Arc de Triomphe, behind you to your right is the Tour Eiffel and Musee d'Orsay, and finally, to your left is the Madeleine.\\n*Continue straight ahead and enter the Tuileries Gardens passing by fountains, flowers, and lovers in the park.\\n*As you continue straight ahead, and out of the garden, you'll see the pyramid entrance to the Louvre directly in front of you.\\n*With the pyramid directly in front of you, and the Tuileries directly behind you, turn to your right and walk towards the Seine.\\n*Now you can walk along the Seine (eastwards) until you reach Pont Neuf. Cross Pont Neuf and walk through the Latin Quarter, cross the river again to reach Notre Dame cathedral on Ile de la Cit\\u00e9.}}\\n\\nWhile the streets of Paris are generally fairly easy on novice cyclists, there are some streets in the city that should be avoided by those who do not have sufficient urban cycling experience. Rue de Rivoli, Place de la Bastille, and Place de la Nation are particularly hairy, especially during weekdays and the Saturday evening rush, and should not be navigated by anyone not confident in their ability to cycle in heavy traffic. Avenue des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, Place de l'\\u00c9toile, and voie Georges Pompidou (the lower-level express lanes along the banks of the Seine) should be avoided at all times.\\n\\nParis has a bike share system known as{{listing\\n| name=V\\u00e9lib' | alt= | url=https://www.velib-metropole.fr/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 76 49 12 34 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\u20ac5 per day, first half hour free\\n|wikidata=|image=| lastedit=2019-02-10\\n| content=In January 2018, the original V\\u00e9lib' was replaced by a new system called V\\u00e9lib' M\\u00e9tropole, that encompasses an ever larger area than the previous one. At first there were some technical issues, but by the end of 2018 it seems like they were mostly resolved. Bikes include a screen showing eg. how long a bike has been rented. Some electric bikes are also available (for an extra fee).\\n}} You can purchase the V\\u00e9lib pass online. An app helps finding stations and available parking slots. Green V\\u00e9lib bikes are normal bikes, blue V\\u00e9libs are ebikes.\\n\\n===By foot===\\n\\nWalking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous caf\\u00e9s and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the ''Metro'' may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.\\n\\nThe smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you'll be able to see more of the city. That said, pay attention to the M\\u00e9tro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the M\\u00e9tro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by walking along a major boulevard until you find a M\\u00e9tro station.\\n\\nYou may have heard of the hazard of walking into dog droppings in Paris. The problem is now virtually nonexistent due to fines as high as \\u20ac180 and extensive street cleaning operations.\\n\\nIt's always fun to experience the city by foot, and there are numerous walking tours around Paris, whether self-guided (with the help of a guidebook or online guide) or with a touring guide (booked through your travel agency or hotel). The city is best explored by foot, and some of the most marvelous memories you will have of Paris is walking through secret found places.\\n\\nPedestrian call buttons at crosswalks are activated by pressing the button underneath the call button box.\\n\\n==Talk==\\n\\n[[French]] (''fran\\u00e7ais'') is of course the country's official language. Any native French person will speak French and it helps if you can speak a bit of it. In the parts of the city that tourists frequent the most, the shopkeepers, information booth attendants, and other workers are likely to answer you in English, even if your French is advanced. These workers tend to deal with thousands of foreign-speaking tourists, and responding in English is often faster than repeating themselves in French. This is not the case for the rest of the city.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Reading up|Before you leave you may want to read a book like ''French or Foe'' by Polly Platt or ''Almost French'' by Sarah Turnbull \\u2014 interesting, well-written records from English-speaking people who live in France.}}\\n\\nFor most Parisians, English is something they had to study in school, and thus seems a bit of a chore. People helping you out in English are making an extra effort, sometimes a considerable one. Parisians younger than 40 are much more likely to be fluent in English. Immigrants, often working in service jobs, are less likely to speak English. If it's your first time in France you will have some problems understanding what people are saying, even with prior education in French. Unlike most language education tapes, real Parisians tend to speak fast, use slang, and swallow some letters.\\n\\nWhen attempting to speak French, do not be offended if people ask you to repeat, or seem not to understand you, as they are not acting out of snobbery. Keep your sense of humour, and if necessary, write down phrases or place names. And remember to speak slowly and clearly. Unless you have an advanced level and can at least sort of understand French movies, you should also assume that it will be difficult for people to understand what you are saying (imagine someone speaking English to you in an indiscernible accent).\\n\\nWhen in need of directions what you should do is this: find a younger person, or a person reading some book or magazine in English, who is obviously not in a hurry; say \\\"hello\\\" or \\\"''bonjour''\\\" (bon-zhor); start by asking if the person speaks English, \\\"Parlez-vous anglais?\\\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay?) even if the person can read something in English, speak slowly and clearly; write down place names if necessary. Smile a lot. Also, carry a map (preferably ''Paris par Arrondissement''); given the complexity of Paris streets it is difficult to explain how to find any particular address in any language, no matter how well you speak it. If anything, the person may have an idea as to the place you are looking for, but may not know exactly where it may be, so the map always helps.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you will probably get the cold shoulder if you stop a random person in the m\\u00e9tro, fail to greet them and say \\\"where is place X or street Y\\\".\\n\\nNow, if you speak French, remember two '''magic phrases''': \\\"Excusez-moi de vous d\\u00e9ranger\\\" [ex-kuh-zay mwuh duh voo day-rawn-ZHAY] (\\\"Sorry to bother you\\\") and \\\"Pourriez-vous m'aider?\\\" [por-EE-AY voo may-DAY] (\\\"Could you help me?\\\") especially in shops; politeness will work wonders.\\n\\nIt is considered polite to always say \\\"bonjour\\\" (during the day) or \\\"bonsoir\\\" (at night) to employees when entering any type of shop even if you have no intention of buying anything. Upon leaving you should say \\\"merci\\\" to thank the shopkeeper for allowing you to browse and say \\\"bonne journ\\u00e9e\\\" (bun zhur-nay) or \\\"bonne soir\\u00e9e\\\" (bun swa-ray) to wish them a good day or evening. \\\"Bonne nuit\\\" is only used when telling someone \\\"goodnight\\\" when going to bed.\\n\\nFinally, if you speak a language other than English or French, and your French is limited or non-existent, offer to speak your second language with the phrase \\\"Parlez-vous anglais ou XXXX?\\\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay oo XXXX?) as this shows that you are making an effort to speak somebody else's language as well as your own.\\n\\n[[File:Pont des Arts, Paris.jpg|thumb|750px|center|The Pont des Arts (Bridge of the Arts) and just behind, the pont Neuf (\\\"New Bridge\\\", but actually the oldest in Paris) and the \\u00eele de la Cit\\u00e9.]]\\n\\n==See==\\n{{Mapframe|48.86473|2.33362|width=600|zoom=12||show=mask,see,do}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q50716}}\\n{{Mapshapes|Q216125}}\\n\\nThe listings below are just some '''highlights''' of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Paris.

These include: The Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle, and the catacombs<!-- and the steps to climb to the top of the Notre Dame Cathedral-->. To avoid lines, you should start your day by arriving at one of these sites at least 30 minutes before opening time. Otherwise, expect a wait of at least an hour. Most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday. Examples: the Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while the Orsay Museum is closed on Mondays. Be sure to check museum closing dates to avoid disappointment! Also, most ticket counters close 30-45 min before final closing.\\n\\nAll national museums are open free of charge on the first Sunday of the month. However, this may mean long lines and crowded exhibits. Keep away from Paris during Easter week due to crowding. People have to queue up at the Eiffel Tower for several hours even early in the morning. However, this wait can be greatly reduced, if fit, by walking the first two levels, then buying an elevator ticket to the top. Entry to the permanent exhibitions at city-run museums is free at all times (admission is charged for temporary exhibitions).\\n\\n===Sightseeing passes===\\nOne of the best value and most convenient ways to see the sights of Paris is with the [http://www.parismuseumpass.com/en/home.php ''Paris Museum Pass'']{{Dead link|date=March 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}, a pre-paid entry card that allows entry into over 70 museums and monuments around Paris (and the Palace of Versailles) and comes in 2-day (\\u20ac62), 4-day (\\u20ac77) and 6-day (\\u20ac92) denominations (August 2024). These are ''consecutive'' days. The card allows you to jump lengthy queues, a big plus during tourist season when lines can be extensive, and is available from participating museums, tourist offices, FNAC branches and all the main M\\u00e9tro and RER train stations. You will still need to pay to enter most special exhibitions. To avoid waiting in the first long queue to purchase the museum pass, stop to purchase your pass a day or more in advance after mid-day. The pass does not become active until your first museum or site visit when you write your start date. After that, the days covered are consecutive. Do not write your start date until you are certain you will use the pass that day and be careful to use the European date style as indicated on the card: day-month-year.\\n\\nAlso consider the [http://www.parispass.com/ ''ParisPass''], a pre-paid entry card + queue jumping to 60 attractions including the Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, as well as a river cruise which allows free metro & public transport travel.\\n\\n==Do==\\n===Sports===\\n* {{do\\n| name=[[Paris/16th arrondissement#Q43605|French Open]] | alt=Roland Garros | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat=48.84716 | long=2.24924 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| image=Roland Garros Stadium in 2007.jpg\\n| content=One of the 4 Tennis Grand Slam tournaments.

Particularly recommended are the food stalls from the overseas territories where you can try regional specialities that are hard to come by even in Metropolitan France, and they will often also have performances from folk musicians/dancers.

Paris hosts several spectacular events that day of which the best known is the '''Bastille Parade''' which is held on the Champs-\\u00c9lys\\u00e9es at 10:00 and broadcast to pretty much the rest of Europe by television. The entire street will be crowded with spectators so arrive early. The '''Bastille Day Fireworks''' is an exceptional treat for travellers lucky enough to be in town on Bastille Day.

There is no user-friendly online version of these guides.\\n\\n===Photography===\\n\\nParis is considered by many as the birthplace of photography, and while one may debate the correctness of this claim, there is no debate that Paris is today a photographer's dream. The French capital offers a spectacular array of photographic expositions and opportunities to the beginner and the pro alike. It has photogenic monuments (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, the obelisk at Concorde, and countless others); architecture (e.g., the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Museum of the Arab World) and urban street scenes (e.g., in the Marais, Montmartre and Belleville). When you tire of taking your own photos, visit one of the many institutions dedicated to photography. At these and other institutions, you can learn the about the rich history of Paris as the place of important developments in photography (e.g., the Daguerrotype) and as the home of many of the trade's great artists (e.g., Robert Doisneau, Andr\\u00e9 Kert\\u00e9sz, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson).\\n\\n* {{listing | type=do\\n| name=Maison Europ\\u00e9ene de la Photographie | alt=La MEP | url=https://www.mep-fr.org/english/ | email=\\n| address=5/7 Rue de Fourcy | lat=48.8551395| long=2.3567364| directions=Metro Saint-Paul, Pont Marie\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours=W-Su 11:00-20:00 | price=Admission \\u20ac9\\n| wikipedia=/Maison_europ\\u00e9enne_de_la_photographie\\n| lastedit=2019-09-29\\n| content=Important center for contemporary photography with a large exposition area having three or four major expositions per year dedicated to contemporary photography.

Unless you possess one of a number of in-demand skills, it will almost certainly be necessary to obtain a job offer from an employer before arriving. Your employer, for their part, will have to have the offer approved by the relevant governmental authorities, as well. If you opt for unreported work, such as babysitting, you need not fret about going through the process to obtain a ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'', i.e., a formal visitor's identity card. However, if you do choose a change in location, it is advisable to obtain a ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'' prior to finding any job whatsoever, as the process can be longer than expected. A ''Carte de s\\u00e9jour'' is often necessary to open a bank account and the like, and by extension for accomplishing any number of other tasks involved in modern life, so unless you're very comfortable transacting everything in cash you should probably bite the bullet and keep things on the up-and-up.\\n\\nIf you go to Paris for a conference, there's a very good chance you'll end up in a meeting or exhibiting at CNIT (Centre of New Industries and Technology). This conference and convention space is one of the oldest buildings in the La Defense area of Paris and still looks modern even though it's been eclipsed in height by surrounding buildings and hotels near the CNIT are mainly catered to those staying in the area on business.\\n\\nRemember, the city of Paris has a huge network of immigrants coming and going, and it is always great to tap into that network. The city holds a great abundance of work ready to be found, even if the search feels nerve-wracking at first.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n\\nParis is one of the great '''fashion''' centres of the Western world, up there with [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], and [[Milan]], making it a shopper's delight. While the Paris fashion scene is constantly evolving, the major shopping centres tend to be the same. High end couture can be found in the 8th arrondissement. In summer, there is nothing better than browsing the boutiques along Canal St-Martin, or strolling along the impressive arcades of the historic Palais-Royal, with beautifully wrapped purchases swinging on each arm.\\n\\n'''Le Marais''' is a mostly Jewish neighbourhood, most of the shops in Le Marais are open on Sundays. The stores in this area are intimate, boutique, \\\"Parisian\\\" style clothing stores. You will no doubt find something along each street, and it is always well worth the look.\\n\\nOther great areas to shop around in are around the area '''S\\u00e8vres Babylone''' (M\\u00e9tro Line 10 and Line 12). It is in this area you will find the Le Bon March\\u00e9 [[Paris/7th arrondissement|7th]], particularly ''rue de Cherche Midi'' [[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]. The area boasts some of the major fashion houses (Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, etc.) and also has smaller private boutiques with handmade clothing.\\n\\nIn the '''Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pr\\u00e9s''', you can find a handful of vintage clothing shops, carrying anything from couture early 20th century dresses, to 70s Chanel sunglasses. Walking along ''Boulevard Saint-Germain'', you will find major brands. However, if in search of eclectic finds, opt to walk the northern side of the Boulevard, especially along '''rue Saint Andr\\u00e9 des Arts''', where you can always find a nice caf\\u00e9 to stop in. The area south of Saint-Germain is just as nice, and comes with a price tag to match.\\n\\nIn the artsy quarters of 1 and 4, there are many bargains to be had, once again, if you are prepared to look. Souvenirs are easily found and can be fairly inexpensive as long as you don't buy from the tourist sites. For cheap books of French connection, try the University/Latin quarter as they sell books in all languages starting from half a euro each.\\n\\n===Flea markets===\\nParis has 3 main flea markets, all on the outskirts of the central city. The most famous of these is the '''March\\u00e9 aux Puces de St-Ouen (Porte de Clignancourt)''' (Clignancourt Flea Market), ''M\\u00e9tro: Porte de Clignancourt'', in the [[Paris/18th arrondissement#Buy|18th]], a haven for lovers of antiques, second-hand goods, and retro fashion. The best days to go are Saturday and Sunday. There are particular times of the week when only antique collectors are allowed into the stalls, and there are also times of the day when the stall owners take their ''Parisian siesta'', and enjoy a leisurely cappuccino for an hour or so. The best times to visit the flea markets are in the spring and summertime, when the area is more vibrant. In and around the metro station, you may find the area a little wild, but still safe.\\n\\nThe [https://www.salutfromparis.com/vanves-flea-market/ '''March\\u00e9 aux Puce de Vanves'''] in the 14th arrondissement is open on Saturday and Sunday from 7h-14h. The closes metro station is Porte de Vanves.\\n\\n===Musical instruments===\\nRue de Rome, situated near Gare St. Lazare, is crowded with luthiers, brass and woodwind makers, piano sellers, and sheet music stores. Subway station Europe. The area south of the metro station Pigalle is also packed with music shops (more oriented towards guitars and drums).\\n\\n===Artwork===\\nFor art lovers, be sure to check out ''Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pr\\u00e9s'', which is renowned for its galleries, and it is impossible to turn a street without finding a gallery to cast your glance in. On Fridays, most open until late. Most even have the benefit of bottles of wine so you can wander in with your glass of wine and feel very ''artistique''. Great roads to walk along are ''rue de Seine'', ''rue Jacob'', ''rue des Beaux Arts'', ''Rue Bonaparte'', and ''Rue Mazarine''.\\nAlso, be sure to visit the historical district of ''Montparnasse'' and ''quartier Vavin'' where artists like Modigliani, Gauguin and Zadkine used to work.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n\\nParis is one of Europe's culinary centres, where the ''haute cuisine'' has flourished since at least the French revolution. It may however come as a surprise that Paris isn't considered the culinary capital of [[French cuisine]]; many people prefer the French cooking found in small rural restaurants, outside of the city, closer to the farms and with their focus on freshness and regional specialities. Even among French cities, Paris has long been considered by the French as second to [[Lyon]] for fine dining.\\n\\nThere have been other challenges in the last 20 years or so as restaurateurs in places like [[San Francisco]] and [[Sydney]] briefly surpassed their Parisian fore bearers, again with an emphasis on freshness of ingredients but also borrowings from other cuisines. Parisian cooks didn't just rest on their laurels during this time, rather they travelled, taught, and studied, and together with Paris's own immigrant communities, have revitalized the restaurant trade. Today you can find hundreds of beautiful restaurants with thoughtful (or just trendy) interior design and well-planned and executed ''cartes'' and ''menus'' offering a creative ''m\\u00e9lange'' of French and exotic foreign cuisines. It's safe to say that Paris is once again catching up with or edging ahead of its ''Anglophone'' rivals.\\n\\nOf course there are also some traditional offerings, and for the budget conscious there are hundreds of traditional bistros, with their sidewalk ''terraces'' offering a choice of fairly simple (usually meat centred) meals for reasonable prices.\\n\\nIt is unfortunately possible to have a uniformly poor dining experience during a stay in Paris, probably because mass tourism attracts price gougers. It is frequent to hear people complaining of very high Parisian prices for very poor food and service. Since so many of the restaurants are sub-par, the best approach is to rely on a restaurant guide and personal recommendations. Do your research in advance if possible and be prepared to travel some distance. Don't just walk down the street expecting to find good food; you probably won't.\\n\\nMany restaurants are tiny and have tables close together - square metres are at a premium and understandably restaurateurs need to make the most of limited space. In some cases when the restaurant is crowded, you may have to sit beside strangers at the same table. If that does not appeal to you, go to a more upscale place where you will pay for the extra space.\\n\\nTrendy restaurants often require reservations weeks, if not months in advance. If you haven't planned far enough ahead, try to get a reservation for lunch which is generally easier and less expensive.\\n\\nFor an easy-to-manage eating budget while in Paris, consider: breakfast or \\\"petit d\\u00e9jeuner\\\" at a restaurant, possibly in your hotel, consisting of some croissants, coffee, and maybe a piece of fruit. Get a 'walking lunch' from one of Paris' many food stands\\u2014a ''panino'' in the centre of the city, a crepe from a crepe stand, a felafel pita or take-out Chinese in the Marais. ''Traiteurs'' serving Chinese and/or Vietnamese food are ubiquitous in the city and good for a cheap lunch and many ''p\\u00e2tisseries'' sell inexpensive coffee and sandwiches. All these are cheap (about the same as breakfast), easy, and allow you to maximize your sightseeing and walking time while enjoying delicious local or ethnic food. For dinner, stroll the streets at dusk and consider a \\u20ac20-40 prix-fixe menu. This will get you 3 or 4 courses, possibly with wine, and an unhurried, candlelit, magical evening. If you alternate days like this with low-budget, self-guided eating (picnicking, snacking, street food) you will be satisfied without breaking the bank.\\n\\nIf one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch. Virtually all restaurants offer a good prix-fixe deal. By complementing this with a bakery breakfast and a light self-catered dinner, you will be able to experience the best of Parisian food and still stick to a budget.\\n\\n===Self-catering===\\nBudget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the [[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]] or in any other arrondissement). If your accommodation has cooking facilities you're set, especially for wine and cheese, a decent bottle of French wine will set you back all of about \\u20ac3-5, while the ''fairly good'' stuff starts at around \\u20ac7. Bottles for less than \\u20ac3 are not recommended.\\n\\nThe small ''\\u00e9piceries'' which open until late are more expensive than the ''supermarch\\u00e9s'' (Casino, Monoprix, Franprix, etc.) For wine, the price difference can be up to \\u20ac2.\\n\\nBuy a baguette, some cheese and a good bottle of wine and join the Parisian youth for a ''pique-nique'' along the Seine (especially on the \\u00cele Saint-Louis) or along the Canal Saint-Martin. The finest food stores are Lafayette Gourmet in the Galeries Lafayette or La Grande Epicerie in the luxury department store Le Bon March\\u00e9. They are worth discovering. You will find a large variety of wines there, otherwise try wine stores (cavistes) that are present everywhere in the city, and sell all kind of good French wine that you won't find in a supermarket. The owners usually know their wines and will be happy to help you choose among their huge selection. Some also sell good food. You can search for one online or ask a local. There are also some \\\"wine supermarkets\\\" such as Nicolas or Le Relais de Bacchus (all over the city) that sell more common wines.\\n\\n===Some specialities===\\n\\nFor '''seafood''' lovers, Paris is a great place to try ''moules frites'' (steamed mussels and French fries) (better in fall and winter), oysters, sea snails, and other delicacies. '''Meat''' specialties include venison (deer), boar, and other game (especially in the fall and winter hunting season), as well as French favourites such as lamb, veal, beef, and pork.\\n\\n===Prices===\\nEating out in Paris can be expensive. However don't believe people when they say you can't do Paris on the cheap - you can! The key is to stay away from the beaten tracks and the obviously expensive Champs Elys\\u00e9es. Around the lesser visited quarters especially, there are many cheap and yummy restaurants to be found. The area around Fontaine Saint-Michel, the fountain facing Notre Dame is crowded by particularly tasty places to eat, with good ambiance, cheap prices and excellent service, with the advantage of being very centric of many places of interest. The key is to order from the prix-fixe menu, and ''not'' off the A la Carte menu unless you want to pay an arm and a leg. In many places a three course meal can be found for about \\u20ac15. This way you can sample the food cheaply and is usually more \\\"French\\\". Ask for \\\"une carafe d'eau\\\" (oon karaaf doe) to get free tap water.\\n\\n===Kosher dining===\\nParis has the largest number of Kosher restaurants in any European city. Walk up and down Rue des Rosiers to see the variety and choices available from Israeli, Sushi, Italian and others. You will also find a wide assortment of Kosher restaurants in the 9th arrondissement of Paris near the rue Richer and rue Cadet areas. See the district guides for examples. Kosher restaurants and snacks usually display a big orange rectangle on their front, which ensure clients that they are Beth din certified.\\n\\n===Vegetarian dining===\\n<!-- please put individual restaurant listings in the appropriate arrondissement page -->\\n\\nFor '''vegetarians''', eating traditional French food will require some improvisation, as it is heavily meat-based. That being said, it is far easier to be vegetarian in Paris than it is elsewhere in France. Paris has several excellent vegetarian restaurants, and many non-vegetarian restaurants will provide vegetarian dishes. \\n\\nWhen eating in a traditional restaurant, be careful before ordering dishes labelled as \\\"vegetarian\\\". Many French people presume that ''fish'' and ''seafood'' are vegetarian dishes. This is a widely spread misunderstanding all around the country. Additionally, French people tend to confuse \\\"real\\\" vegetarians with vegans. When explaining that you're a vegetarian that won't eat fish, people will often presume that you don't eat milk or egg-based products.\\n\\nLook for spots such as Le Grenier de Notre-Dame in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]'''. The '''[[Paris/10th arrondissement|10th]]''' arrondissement also has quite a large variety of vegetarian restaurants, especially of Indian and East/South-East Asian fare. See the arrondissement pages for more listings. For fast food and snacks, you can always find a vegetarian sandwich or pizza, or indeed French tacos. Even a kebab shop can make you something with just cheese and salad, or perhaps falafel. And for healthier fare, it's not usually hard nowadays to find hipstery places that sell vegan poke bowls.\\n\\nThere are also lots of Italian, Thai, Indian, and Mezo-American places where you will have little problem. The famous South Indian chain Saravana Bhavan have their branch near Gare Du Nord. In Rue des Rosiers (4th arrondissement) you can get delicious falafel in the many Jewish restaurants. Another place to look for falafel is on Rue Oberkampf (11th arrondissement). Take away falafel usually goes for \\u20ac5 or less.\\n\\nMoroccan and Algerian cooking is common in Paris - vegetarian couscous is lovely. Another good option for vegetarians - are traiteurs, particularly around Ledru Rollin (down the road from Bastille) take away food where you can combine a range of different options such as pomme dauphinoise, dolmas, salads, vegetables, nice breads and cheeses and so on.\\n\\nLebanese restaurants and snack shops abound as well, offering a number of vegetarian ''mezze'', or small plates. The stand-bys of course are hummas, falafel, and baba-ganouche (''caviar d'aubergine''). A good place to look for Lebanese is in the pedestrian zone around Les Halles and Beaubourg in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]] and [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]].\\n\\nAlso look out for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) places, especially around Rue Mouffetard in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]''', where you can often get a tofu banh mi for less than a fiver.\\n\\n===Tourists and locals===\\n\\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually geared towards tourists. It does make a difference in the staff's service and behaviour whether they expect you to return or not.\\n\\nSometimes the advertised fixed price tourist menus (\\u20ac10-15) are a good deal. If you're interested in the really good and more authentic stuff (and if you have learned some words of French) try one of the small bistros where the French go during lunch time.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n\\nThe bars scene in Paris really does have something for everyone. From bars which serve drinks in baby bottles, to ultra luxe clubs that require some name dropping, or card (black Amex) showing, and clubs where you can dance like no one's watching, (although they will be). To start your night out right, grab a drink or two in a ubiquitous dive bar, before burning up the dance floor and spreading some cash, at one of the trendy clubs.\\n\\n*'''Canal St Martin'''. Many cozy caf\\u00e9s and other drinking establishments abound around the ''Canal St Martin'' in the '''[[Paris/10th arrondissement|10th]]'''.\\n*'''The Marais'''. The Marais has a large number of trendier new bars mostly in the '''[[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]]''' and to a lesser extent the '''[[Paris/3rd arrondissement|3rd]]''' with a few old charmers tossed into the mix. A number of bars and restaurants in the Marais have a decidedly gay crowd, but are usually perfectly friendly to straights as well. Some seem to be more specifically aimed at up-and-coming hetero singles.\\n*'''Bastille'''. There is a very active nightlife zone just to the northeast of Place de Bastille centered around ''rue de Lappe'', ''rue de la Roquette'', ''rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine'' (especially the amazing Club Barrio Latino) and ''rue de Charonne'' in the '''[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]'''. Many of the bars closest to Bastille have either a North, Central, or South American theme, with a couple of Aussie places mixed in for good measure, and as you continue up ''rue de Charonne'' the caf\\u00e9s have more of a traditionally French but grungy feeling.\\n*'''Quartier Latin - Odeon'''. If you're looking for the ''nouvelle vague'' (new wave) style, student and intellectual atmosphere of Paris in the 1960s and 70s, you'll find a lot of that (and more hip and chic) places in the quartier Latin and between place Odeon and the Seine. The neighbourhood is also home of many small artsy cinemas showing non-mainstream films and classics (check 'Pariscope' or 'l'officiel du spectacle' at any newspaper stand for the weekly programme).\\n*'''Rue Mouffetard and environs'''. The area in the '''[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]''' on the south side of the hill topped by the Panth\\u00e9on has a little bit of everything for the nighthawk, from the classy caf\\u00e9s of Place de la Contrescarpe to an Irish-American dive bar just down the way to a hip, nearly hidden jazz caf\\u00e9 at the bottom of the hill.\\n*'''Ch\\u00e2telet'''. In some ways the ''Marais'' starts here in the '''[[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]''' between ''Les Halles'' and ''H\\u00f4tel de Ville'' but with between all of the tourists and the '''venerable Jazz clubs''' on ''rue des Lombards'' the area deserves some special attention.\\n*'''Montmartre'''. You'll find any number of cozy caf\\u00e9s and other drinking establishments all around the ''Butte Montmartre'' in the '''[[Paris/18th arrondissement|18th]]''', especially check out ''rue des Abbesses'' near the ''M\\u00e9tro'' station of the same name.\\n*'''Oberkampf-M\\u00e9nilmontant'''. If you are wondering where to find the hipsters (''bobos'' for bohemian-bourgeois), then this is where to look. There are ''several'' clusters of grungy-hip bars all along ''rue Oberkampf'' in the '''[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]''', and stretching well into the '''[[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]]''' up the hill on ''rue de M\\u00e9nilmontant''. It's almost like being in [[San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco/Haight-Fillmore District|Haight-Fillmore]] district.\\n*'''Bagnolet'''. There are a cluster of bar/restaurant/nightclubs along the southern end of the P\\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in the [[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]] including probably the best place in Paris for nightly local and touring punk rock.\\n*'''Rues des Dames-Batignolles'''. Another good place to find the grungy-chic crowd is the northern end of the '''[[Paris/17th arrondissement|17th]]''' around ''rue des Dames'' and ''rue des Batignolles'', and if you decide you want something a little different Montmartre is just around the corner.\\n*'''Port de Tolbiac'''. This previously deserted stretch of the river Seine in the '''[[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th]]''' was reborn as a center for nightlife (and Sunday-afternoon-life) a few years ago when an electronic music cooperative opened the '''Batofar'''. Nowadays there are a number of boats moored along the same ''quai'', including a boat with a Caribbean theme, and one with an Indian restaurant.\\n*'''Saint Germain des Pr\\u00e9s'''. This area has two of the most famous caf\\u00e9s in the world: Caf\\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots, both catering to the tourists and the snobs who can afford their high prices. This part of the '''[[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]''' is where the Parisian caf\\u00e9 scene really started, and there still are hundreds of places to pull up to a table, order a glass, and discuss Sartre deep into the evening.\\n\\nFor individual bar listings see the various Arrondissement pages under '''Drink'''.\\n\\nOf course there are lots of interesting places which are sort of off on their own outside of these clusters, including a few like the '''Hemingway Bar at the Ritz''' which are not to be missed in a serious roundup of Parisian drinking, so check out the listings even in those arrondissements we haven't mentioned above.\\n\\nSome nightclubs in Paris that are worth it: Folies Pigalle (pl. Pigalle, 18th, very trashy, \\u20ac20), Rex Club (near one of the oldest cinemas on earth, the Grand Rex, house/electro, about \\u20ac15). You might also want to try Cabaret (Palais Royal), Maison Blanche, le Baron (M Alma-Marceau). Remember when going out to dress to impress, you are in Paris! Torn clothing and sneakers are not accepted. The better you look, the more likely you will get past the random decisions of club bouncers. Also important to remember if male (or in a group of guys) that it will be more difficult to enter clubs; try to always have an equal male/female ratio.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n=== Hotels ===\\nBeing often declared the most popular travel destination in the world, Paris has far over a thousand hotels to choose from, and even more in the surrounding [[Ile-de-France]] region. The choice may be overwhelming, but should be made carefully. There are huge differences in standards and location is key to make your stay in Paris enjoyable and time used well. Be prepared to pay the price for Paris' popularity - even the cheap hotels are relatively expensive.\\n\\nDespite the popularity with tourists, global hotel chains have relatively low penetration of the Parisian market. A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered. There is a fair amount of Best Westerns as well, but most international chains limit their presence to very few exclusive (and expensive) hotels in key locations. Travellers loyal to a particular brand may find their loyalty challenged, be forced to pay for it (rather than be rewarded) or unable to find their hotel brand of choice in Paris.\\n\\nHotels in the central arrondissements tend to be expensive, although very cheap ones can also be found. With few exceptions, they tend to offer small rooms - be aware of the fact that the difference in price between hotels can translate into difference in service, facility and appointment levels, but not necessarily room size. Rooms of 12-16 square metres (which is roughly half of standard hotels rooms e.g. in the USA) are the norm in central Paris, regardless of hotel standards.\\n\\nCheaper hotels in popular arrondissements tend to be older, less attractive properties, whose facilities and appointments may be very worn and outdated, far behind standards one would expect from the capital of all things pretty and fine. Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.\\n\\nHotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the ''Peripherique'' and Paris itself, can be far cheaper and better value for money than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, you should check thoroughly how far from the metro / RER station the given hotel is, and whether the connection to the POIs you want to visit is direct, quick and easy. Do also factor in the added cost of transportation to outer zones, as well as the time spent to travel to and from the city and obviously resulting limitations.\\n\\nBecause of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called \\\"''douche italienne''\\\" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.\\n\\nParis hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low seasons. These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around the Christmas season.\\n\\nFor individual hotel listings see the various [[#Districts|Arrondissement]] pages. <!-- please add individual hotel listings on the various Arrondissement pages -->\\n\\n=== Apartment rentals ===\\nFor those staying for a week or more, renting a furnished apartment might be a more comfortable and money-saving option, especially for 3 or more adults. Furnished apartments can differ considerably in location and quality, offer different accommodations and selections of appliances and kitchen features, or may be well-above street level with no elevator. Expect apartment sizes to be modest. Access to local public transport can also vary widely. So choose carefully only after getting a full description of an interesting property.\\n\\nMany websites will help you find rentals. Some do a more disciplined job of locating and describing properties and their locale. Most charge a commission of 10% or more; some offer insurance covering some risks. Some may offer a few apartments for shorter stays, usually at somewhat higher cost per day.\\n\\nIn late-spring and summer months, desirable properties may be in short supply. If your plans are fairly firm for those periods, you would be wise to \\\"reserve\\\" a unit well in-advance. Owners will often ask for a non-refundable deposit of up to 50% of the total cost of your stay. Means of payment can range from money order to PayPal or (occasionally) charge card. (Take great care of how and with whom you share any charge card account number.) You should send no payment to any post office box or similarly anonymous place or account...even after exchanging e-mails with a purported owner; most are no more than \\\"blind\\\" scams to take your money.\\n\\nThe city government has passed ordinances that require owners renting properties for short periods to collect a tax previously collected only by hotels. This substantial tax may not be collected by some owners, or may be demanded by them but not mentioned in their rates until you arrive. Tax enforcement and collection remain in a state of flux.\\n\\nSome agencies, rental brokers or web sites, that seem amicable, attractive or claim reputations, do not abide by French law to carefully vet and select landlords and apartments they offer for rent. There are a certain number of guarantees, which are required in France before renting an apartment, and an insurance policy, which aims at protecting the tenants during their stay.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Crime===\\nDespite what many naysayers might say or believe, Paris is still a relatively safe city. This does not stop it from being plagued by petty [[crime]], especially [[pickpocketing]], and muggings. Scams, of which there are many, are also prevalent, though the police are slowly cracking down on them. While not common, purse snatchings do happen. Violent crime is rare. However, watch yourself at ATMs and other places where your cash may be visible. Keep your money and your wallet in your front pockets, and avoid ATMs that are open to the outside, especially at night.\\n\\nAs a densely populated city with equally dense neighbourhoods, one would be remiss to generalise the safety of entire 'arrondissements' based on a few specific areas. Several arrondissements have their share of crime, however. The 18th, 19th, and 20th arrondissements are widely seen as the least safe areas of Paris, but safety levels vary dramatically from street to street. During the day, they're usually fine; you might have to watch out for pickpockets and scammers, but not much more. However, be on your guard at night. The 10th arrondissement (namely the areas bordering the 18th and 19th arrondissements) and the southeastern portion of the \\\"p\\u00e9riph\\u00e9rique\\\" have also gained a reputation for being sketchy.\\n\\nSeveral of the inner suburbs of the metropolitan area (commonly referred to as the ''banlieues'') such as La Courneuve, [[Saint-Denis (\\u00cele-de-France)|Saint-Denis]], Sarcelles, and Pantin are notoriously 'rough' by European standards, and you should be cautious when visiting these places. Unrest in those areas has made global headline news (as did the somewhat heavy-handed reactions of various French governments).\\n\\nThe police can be reached by phone by dialling 17. Not all police officers speak English, but those found around touristy areas almost always will. They are usually friendly and perfectly approachable should you have to.\\n\\n==== Theft in public transit ====\\nThe m\\u00e9tro and RER are also a popular place for pickpockets. '''Hold things tightly and be aware of your surroundings.''' While trains are usually crowded, if someone is insisting and hovers over you, they are probably going through your pockets. It is important to know that a majority of these belong to a gang. These gangs usually use young children as young as seven, with groups of them going around the metro stations pickpocketing tourists and locals alike. If there is a group of three or more suspicious looking people, be careful of your belongings. This is a notable occurrence on M\\u00e9tro line 13, tramways, and the RER B.\\n\\nCommon tactics are two of them blocking you as you try to board the subway, with two behind you quickly going through your bag. Seconds before the doors close, the two jump off, leaving you on the metro without even realizing what has happened. Take note of what locals do. If someone warns you to be careful, there are probably some suspicious types hoping to steal from you. Also be aware that phone-snatching is the most reported crime, and avoid using your cellphone on metro platforms and in the metro itself.\\n\\nPickpockets are active on the rail link (RER B) from Charles de Gaulle airport to downtown Paris, which passes through the poor suburbs of Seine-Saint Denis. Try to take the trains which are nonstop between the airport and Paris proper (Gare du Nord) - EKLI/EKIL from Paris to CDG and KRIN/KROL from CDG to Paris. These are faster and are less crowded than the alternative.\\n\\nThere have also been problems with thieves physically fighting people in order to steal their belongings. The most common targets are those with suitcases and backpacks, i.e. tourists. Thieves usually coin their acts with the closing of the doors. Newer trains have cameras everywhere, and thieves are much less likely to use them. Otherwise, stow luggage on the racks above the seat (which is not possible in newer trains) and hold on to your bags so no one can grab them and then run out. You are much less likely of being a victim if the train is crowded with locals headed to work, usually at rush hour.\\n\\nThe train conductors are widely aware of these crimes and will usually wait a few seconds to leave the station after the doors have closed, just in case thieves have quickly jumped off with belongings. There are also emergency cords that one can pull if willing to chase after the attackers. People will usually be helpful and gladly call the police if you do not have a cell phone.\\n\\n==== Theft in tourist hotspots ====\\nPickpockets are most likely to be found working at crowded tourists hotspots, so keep your wallet and phone in your front pockets and hold your backpack tightly when in a crowd.\\n\\nA common place for phone/camera/wallet snatching is in tourist friendly dining areas scattered all over Paris where exposed outdoor tables are commonly right on busy sidewalks. Common practice by many Western tourists is to leave an aforementioned item of value on the table (most commonly a smartphone) in front of them. Some of the criminals, working in groups of three to five people, approach your table and shove what appears to be a survey directly under your nose thus blocking your view of your valuable. While the gang members are yelling in a foreign language another one will slip a hand below your view and take your item of value from the table. This occurs very quickly (less than five seconds) and the perpetrators disappear around the corner just as quick as they arrived.\\n\\nKey landmarks like the Louvre or the Eiffel tower have been plagued with gangs of pickpockets, which typically operate in groups of about five. As many as half a dozen of these gangs may be active at a particularly famous, crowded venue at any one time; occasionally there are fights between rival gangs of thieves. Asian visitors are often targeted due to a presumption that they are visiting from affluent nations. Venue staff have complained of being spat at, threatened, abused or assaulted by pickpocketing gangs; the Louvre closed briefly in 2013 (as did the Eiffel tower in 2015) due to worker protests of unsafe conditions due to criminal activity. Token attempts to deploy more police have not solved the problems.<!-- http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32844573 -->\\n\\n==== Scams ====\\n[[File:People at Montmartre \\\"selling\\\" trinkets.JPG|right|thumb|The men who will try to tie strings on your fingers]]\\nAt Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur, there are many men who will try to tie strings or bracelets on your finger (often called \\\"string muggers\\\"). Not only will they demand an obscene fee for the cheap trinkets (usually over \\u20ac15), they will also try to pickpocket you or threaten you with force if you do not give them money. They are usually only at the base of the monument and can be avoided by taking the Funicular of Montmartre. Otherwise, you can quickly walk past them and ignore them, though they will readily grab people's arms and have even been known to target children of tourists. Yelling at them may cause unwanted attention and cause them to back off, but be careful. Sacr\\u00e9-C\\u0153ur appears to be the only area where they congregate, but they have been sighted also near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nBesides them, you will notice many people walking around with cheap trinkets at touristy areas, especially the Trocad\\u00e9ro, Eiffel Tower, and Louvre Museum. They are generally not rude, but buying things from them is illegal and hurts small businesses. Of course, they bolt at the sight of the police, and you may end up in the middle of a stampede!\\n\\nBe careful around Barb\\u00e8s-Rochechouart and the bars near Moulin Rouge. A very common [[clip joint]] trick is played here which might cost you up to \\u20ac500. The agents standing outside will force you to enter a bar and just have a look for 5 minutes. The moment you order a drink (about \\u20ac5), a girl will approach you and start talking generally, and leave in 10\\u201315 minutes. After a harmless conversation with the girls when you request a bill, you will encounter a charge of say \\u20ac200-500 as 'service fees' for the services rendered by the girl! In case you resist paying, the bouncers will start intimidating you to try to extract money from your wallet. In such cases, threaten them that you are calling the police and informing the local embassy. Try to buy some time and start creating a ruckus. However, do not try to start a fight with the bouncers. This trick is common to many European big cities.\\n\\nOne scam involves a \\\"helpful\\\" local buying a ticket for you. Normally, tourists buy 1-day, 3-day or longer Paris Visite passes. They would tell you that your single trip ticket has expired and bring you to the ticketing machine to purchase day passes. Then they would select the 3 day pass for adults (even though you may be a student) and deliberately show you the price on the screen. Everything else is in French so you would not understand a thing. They would proceed to purchase with a credit card and while entering the PIN code, get you to turn your back on them. They then sneakily change the ticket to a single trip ticket and ask for payment for a 3-day ticket from you. Unsuspecting tourists would pay the full sum thinking it is a 1-day or 3-day pass when it is only a useless ticket. Buy the tickets yourself to avoid situations like these, as machines are available in English and other languages. If you feel threatened, call the police and don't physically handle the ticket if they forcibly purchase without your agreement.\\n\\nAnother common scam is found along the banks of the Seine river and involves a ring. This involves thieves \\\"finding\\\" a ring which they give to you. They then ask you if you own it. When you say no, they insist you keep it, saying it goes against their religion or they cannot wear rings. A few moments later, they ask you for money to buy something to eat, eventually following you and becoming more annoying. You can either yell at them or steer them towards an area where there are likely to be police present, at which point they will quickly run away.\\n\\nThe most common scam (besides pickpocketing) that has taken over Paris by storm since June 2011 involves women coming up to tourists with pledge sheets. They pretend to be deaf people collecting money for one charity or another. Once you are distracted with the petition, an accomplice pickpockets you and takes your belongings. In addition, once you sign, they point to a thing that reads \\\"minimum ten euro donation.\\\" While they may at first insist on this, shaking your head and walking away will usually make them pester someone else. Otherwise, simply waving them off and a loud no should make them give up. If they are in a large group, as is common, be careful of your belongings! This is a ploy to pickpocket you as you are surrounded by them. At this point, yelling for the police will make them disperse quickly. This is most commonly found around major tourist sites, but has also been a problem at Gare du Nord, though this has gotten much better.\\n\\nNever bet money on a 3-card game as you will always lose. This trick is played by con artists on some of the bridges on River Seine near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nA more modern scam takes place on ride-sharing apps such as Bolt. The \\\"driver\\\" will send you a message, saying you need to provide your mobile number in order to \\\"confirm\\\" the booking (this is not true; no such rule exists). Once you have done so, they will then attempt to use your number to sign into an account on another app (such as Uber), and send you another message on the first app requesting your confirmation code (which you will have received in a text message from the second app after you gave out your number). They will use another made-up excuse (\\\"Uber now runs Bolt operations in Paris\\\") to talk you into doing this. If the scam is a success, they will have access your account, and can run up massive bills by booking rides in your name. As such, if you receive such a message, do not engage, just cancel the ride and report the driver as a scammer. The app should then refund your cancellation fee. \\n\\nIt is a good idea to steer clear of the suburb of Seine Saint-Denis, as this suburb is known for its gangs and poverty, though there is little of interest to tourists anyway (except the Basilique de Saint-Denis, but that is located near a m\\u00e9tro station). You may want to avoid walking alone at night in the 18th and 19th arrondissements as well, as these can be a little shady at night. There is a large problem with youths from the depressed suburbs causing trouble with the police. If locals are moving away, it is most likely from a confrontation. While these groups rarely target people besides the police, be careful. Walk away from a situation that could lead to fights or worse.\\n\\nIn general, remember to be aware of pickpockets, as they act by trying to distract you. Avoid showing off expensive phones or a lot of money in public transportation or in open areas. Put your things in a money belt or your front pockets, but never in the back pockets.\\n\\n====Danger for identifiably Jewish people====\\nParis has the largest Jewish community in Europe and the 6th largest in the world. However, antisemitic acts have increased in France since the early 2000s, culminating with the January 2015 \\u00cele-de-France attacks targeting a local kosher supermarket. Attacks on Jews have since decreased and as of 2023, there have been no recent reports of attacks against tourists of Jewish faith. After 2015, the French government assigned thousands of soldiers to guard synagogues and Jewish schools. Still, fearing harassment or attacks, many of the local Jews no longer wear a kippa/yarmulke in the street or public transportation. So consider taking the advice of local Jews regarding your behavior. For example, if you wear a kippa, consider wearing it under a hat that is not identifiably Jewish.\\n\\n==Respect==\\n\\nParisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant. While this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris still is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is \\\"''bien \\u00e9lev\\u00e9''\\\" (well brought up). It will make getting about considerably easier.\\n\\nParisians' abrupt exteriors will rapidly evaporate if you display some basic courtesies. A simple \\\"''Bonjour, Madame''\\\" when entering a shop, for example, or \\\"''Excusez-moi''\\\" when trying to get someone's attention, are very important; say \\\"''Pardon''\\\" or better \\\"''je suis d\\u00e9sol\\u00e9''\\\" if you bump into someone accidentally or make other mistakes. If you speak French or are using a phrasebook remember to always use the vous form when addressing someone you don't know; this may transform the surliest shop assistant into a smiling helper or the grumpiest inhabitant to a helpful citizen. Courtesy is extremely important in France (where the worst insult is to call someone \\\"''mal \\u00e9lev\\u00e9''\\\", or \\\"badly brought up\\\").\\n\\nIf you only learn one long phrase in French a good one would be \\\"''Excusez-moi de vous d\\u00e9ranger, monsieur/madame, auriez-vous la gentillesse de m'aider?''\\\" (pardon me for bothering you, sir/madam, would you have the kindness to help me?) - this level of extreme politeness is about the closest one can come to a magic wand for unlocking Parisian hospitality. If you know some French, try it! But remember, too, that Parisians have places to go and things to do, so if they have no time and don't answer you, don't take it personally. Many Parisians, given time, will go out of their way to help, especially if you make an effort to speak their language and act polite to them.\\n\\nMost foreigners tend to ignore two basic rules of courtesy in metro and train transport in Paris. If the carriage is full and you're sitting on a folding seat, you should consider standing up. If you stand next to the door, you are expected to get down to the platform at a stop so that people inside can find their way out.  Once they have got out, you can go back. However, don't always expect that others will do the same for you and, if the train is full, get ready to get down with enough time in advance. In a corridor, when pushing a door, you are expected to hold it for the next person, so that it won't close abruptly. This rule is strictly observed in the metro, and quite commonly everywhere else.\\n\\nIn addition, if you are traveling to or from the airport or train station and have luggage with you, make certain that you are not blocking the aisles in the train by leaving your bags on the floor. The RER B (which links both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports to the city) has luggage racks above the seats (on the newer trains, there are no such racks above the seats, but racks dedicated to luggage in between some seats); it is best to use them so you do not block the path of a local who is getting off the train before the airport stop. On the m\\u00e9tro and especially in the RER, don't take up extra seats with your luggage. There are luggage racks and spaces between the seats.\\n\\nThere are hefty fines for littering in Paris, especially with dog droppings (often you'll find free plastic bag dispensers around parks or playgrounds).\\n\\n==Connect==\\nAs of Sept 2021, Paris has 5G from all French carriers. Wifi is widely available in public places, transport, cafes and so on.\\n\\nOne helpful thing about having official and numbered districts in Paris is that you can easily tell which arrondissement an address is in by its postal code, and can easily come up with the postal code for a Paris address if you know its arrondissement. The rule is just pre-pend 750 or 7500 to the front of the arrondissement number, with 75001 being the postal code for the 1st and 75011 being the postal code for the 11th, and so on. The 16th has two postal codes, 75016 for the portion south of Rue de Passy and 75116 to the north; all other arrondissements only have one postal code.\\n\\nPhone cards are available from most \\\"tabacs\\\" but make sure you know where you can use them when you buy them, as some places still sell the ''cartes cabines'' which are hard to use as ''cabines'' are rare.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\nFamous for its status as \\\"fashion capital\\\", Paris isn't as conservative in dress as one might think. Parisians will tolerate all kinds of clothes as long as they're worn \\\"avec style\\\" (with style). That's why men do not usually wear shorts shorter than above the knee outside of sporting events: it is not considered indecent but may stand out from the locals; shorts are for \\\"schoolboys and football players\\\" only.\\n\\n===Airlines===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Adria Airways | url=http://www.adria.si | email=\\n| address=94 r Saint Lazare 75009 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= |

Built by Gustave Eiffel in 1887-1889, the tower was almost torn down in 1909 and only saved due to its use as a telegraphy antenna. The queues can be very long. The tower allows online reservations at its website. You can select a date and time frame. If you miss the time on your ticket, you have lost your money. The north, west, and east pillars have elevators that go to the first and second floors; the south pillar has stairs that can be climbed to the second floor. To reach the top floor, an additional elevator ride is required, and the wait for this can be very long as well. Disabled visitors are not allowed beyond the second floor due to safety concerns. Taking the M\\u00e9tro as far as Ecole Militiare and then strolling up the Champ de Mars is a lovely way to arrive at the tower. Another phenomenal approach is to exit the Metro at Trocadero and see the Eiffel Tower from the other side of the Ecole Militaire.\\n}}\\n* {{see\\n| name=l'Assembl\\u00e9e Nationale | alt= | url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/ | email=\\n| address=33, quai d'Orsay | lat=48.862192 | long=2.318716 | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 40 63 60 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=M F Sa 08:40-11:40 and 14:00-17:00 | price=\\n| wikipedia=National Assembly (France) | image=Paris Assemblee Nationale DSC00074.jpg | wikidata=Q193582\\n| content=Guided tours conducted all day, ID required.

In the east, the road connects Muang Khua to the northernmost border crossing with [[Vietnam]], near the Vietnamese city of [[Dien Bien Phu]]. Buses leave daily from Dien Bien Phu's bus station early in the morning. Travel time is around 5 hours, including customs.\\n\\nBuses from [[Muang Xay]] stop 2&nbsp;km away on the west side (35,000 kip for the bus and 5,000 kip for a collective tuk-tuk to the town centre).\\n\\n===By boat===\\nMuang Khua is about halfway between [[Phongsali]] in the north and the backpacker-popular village of [[Muang Ngoi Neua]], with connections further south to [[Luang Prabang]].\\n\\nTickets can be bought from the boat dock, half an hour before the boat leaves. From the visitors centre, with the market in front of you, turn left and take the first street right.

Tickets to [[Muang Ngoi Neua]] (written Muang Ngoy on the boat dock sign) are 100,000 kip. Tickets to [[Nong Khiaw]] (an hour south of Muang Ngoy) are 120,000 kip. Boats may not leave if there are not enough people (~12 people per boat) (Oct 2013) unless they are chartered. Do not expect the boats to operate more often than once in a few days.\\n\\nDue to the Ou River 3 Hydro Power Station you have to change the boats and go with a songthaew around the dam/power plant.

These are discussed in more detail later.\\n\\nLight pollution around cities can mask a dim aurora display. Therefore, areas at least 30 km from cities are preferred for viewing.
