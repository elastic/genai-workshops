It has the highest number of bikes per capita, and essentially everyone cycles here, especially in cities like [[Amsterdam]] and [[Groningen]]. In fact, cycling is the main form of transportation in the country.\\n{{CyclingTopics}}\\n==Choosing a bike==\\nSince the Netherlands are pretty much flat when it comes to terrain, you can do with any ordinary city bike. Having a few gears to choose from when having to cycle with your face first into the wind is recommended but not mandatory. Typically, your choice should go between a ''stadsfiets'' (city bike), often defined by model; a ''herenfiets'' (gentlemen's bike) will have the additional bar between the bike seat and the handlebar, whereas a ''damesfiets'' (lady's bike) does not. To get on a ''herenfiets'', you would have to swing your leg over the backside of the bike, which wouldn't be the case with a ''damesfiets''. If the bike does not have multiple gears, then the Dutch language counts it as outdated, which makes a ''herenfiets'' an ''opafiets'' (grandpa's bike) and a ''damesfiets'' an ''omafiets'' (grandma's bike). The latter usually set you back around \\u20ac8 per day per bike, while stadsfietsen can cost around \\u20ac2 more per day per bike.\\n\\nE-bikes are often also available. These are more expensive, but are motorized to help you get up to speed. They can be rented for \\u20ac15 to \\u20ac20, but prices may vary depending on the rental service you're using as well as the region you're in.\\n\\nTandems are often an option in more tourist-y retreats, such as the [[West Frisian Islands]], but can often be found at most major rental services. They can be obtained for just \\u20ac16, or the price of two regular bikes. Tandems can fit two people at the same time.\\n\\nChild seats (''kinderzitjes''), transport crates and bags (''fietskratten'' and ''fietstassen'') can often be obtained for an additional \\u20ac2. Bikelocks are most often not necessary outside of the large cities. Most every bike is equipped with a simple lock underneath the bike seat, but chain locks may be provided by default in the larger cities.\\n\\n==Travelling with a bike==\\n[[File:Merwedelingelijn Fietsvervoer.JPG|thumb|Bikes often have a dedicated carriage in trains.

Usage of the white bicycles that are available is included in the entry fee. On some busy summer days, those typical white bicycles might already be taken, and you would have to rent a bike elsewhere.\\n\\nThe area known as the [[Groene Hart]] is a nice nature getaway within the busy [[Randstad]], it's easier and more beautiful to cycle there than in cities. The villages and nature around Braassemermeer and Langeraarseplassen are an amazing location for cycling.\\n\\nIf you want more than the flat landscapes the Netherlands is known for, [[South Limburg]] offers a hilly landscape that's great for cycling.\\n\\n==Maps==\\nA very detailed and free online cycling map is the [https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/52.269/4.219&layers=C bicycle layer of openstreetmap.org].\\n\\nThe same map can be viewed on [https://cycling.waymarkedtrails.org/#search?map=8.0/52.3309/6.0569 cycling.waymarkedtrails.org] where you can see easily the cycling routes on the map.\\n\\nThis OpenStreetMap, including the bcicycle view, can be viewed on smartphones using the free map app OsmAnd, and used also for basic navigation. Experienced bicycle tourists can find more advanced tools for navigation with the OpenStreetMap cycling map.\\n\\nGoogle Maps has detailed information in the Netherlands, but you'll need a compass, because Google Maps often uses directions like north, south, east and west, which are often not clear in reality.\\n\\n== Routes ==\\n[[File:Groningen provincial bicycle routes cross point (2017).jpg|thumb|A node marker, showing the directions for the nodes around it.]]\\nThe Netherlands is littered with routes made specifically for cyclists. \\n\\n===LF-routes===\\nFor the most enthusiastic cyclists, there are the '''LF-icoonroutes'''. These are multiple-day routes crossing the country from one extreme to the other.\\n\\nLF-icoonroutes can be found in the Netherlands and [[Flanders]]:\\n* '''LF Kustroute''' ([[EuroVelo cycling routes|EuroVelo]] 12) crossing through the natural dunes and beaches, their man-made counterparts, and the [[Wadden Sea]] coast;\\n* '''LF Maasroute''' (EuroVelo 19), following the course of the river Meuse from [[Maastricht]] to [[Rotterdam]] and its immense port;\\n* '''LF Waterlinieroute''', roughly following the [[Randstad]]'s eastern limits, crossing by many of the former fortifications that once made up the Waterlinie, a defence network that was protected the economic heartland of the country in case of a hostile invasion;\\n* '''LF Zuiderzeeroute''', following the former Zuiderzee and the many fishing communities around the modern-day lakes that replaced the former Sea after the construction of the [[Afsluitdijk]] and [[Flevoland]].\\n\\nThese LF-routes were preceded by a different, numbered system that was maintained until 2020. Much of the signage of those routes is still in place, mostly in the east of the country where the LF-icoonroutes aren't present.\\n\\nMany of the shorter routes that can be completed in one or occasionally two days are listed at [https://www.hollandcyclingroutes.com/ HollandCyclingRoutes]{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}, the website of the organisation behind the LF-icoonroutes.\\n\\n===Fietsknooppunten===\\nMost domestic recreational cyclists will use ''fietsknooppunten'' (Cycling nodes) to stitch their own route together by linking several nodes or to navigate pre-made routes that use the nodes for navigation reference. All of these nodes as well as the roads connecting them give a near-infinite variety of routes and are all surprisingly well documented through roadside signage.\\n\\n[https://www.hollandcyclingroutes.com/cycling-daytrips Fietsknooppunten]{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} (Cycling nodes) are a lot of nodes on a map that you can cycle between. These points and the road to get there are well-signposted. You may sometimes see signs with \\u201c U nadert knooppunt\\u201d which mean that you are approaching a node. Maps can be obtained from ANWB-stores, but are also found on a signpost at most cycling nodes. You can also download the ''Fietsknoop'' app available for [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.vv.fietsknoop Andriod], [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fietsknoop/id351409471?mt=8 iOS] and [https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/p/fietsknoop/9nblggh09kfp#activetab=pivot:overviewtab Windows Phone]. To use the network, simply find a node close to your starting location, and plan out a route from there, following signage to get from node to node. A lot of routes are also pre-loaded on the app.\\n\\n== Stay safe ==\\nUnfortunately, bike theft is a common occurrence in the Netherlands, especially in bigger cities like Amsterdam. It would be best to invest in a bike lock when buying a bike. Rented bikes on the other hand often come with a perfectly capable lock included.\\n\\nIf bicycling in an area with canals, avoid falling into them. As silly as it sounds, thousands of bicycles fall into canals in Amsterdam every year, and the same caution should go for any other city that has canals.\\n\\nIn Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, and any other city that has them, be wary of tram rails, and always be sure to cross them at an angle. Large gaps between bike lane tiles should be treated the same way. \\n\\nAlthough most cyclists in the Netherlands don\\u2019t usually wear knee-pads, helmets or any other safety measures, don't feel afraid to use them if you're not too sure about your own abilities when it comes to cycling. Cycling, including urban cycling, takes a bit to get used to, especially if you've only used a bike a few times in your life.\\n\\n== See also ==\\n* [[Cycling in the Achterhoek]]\\n\\n* [[Cycling in Germany]]\\n{{PartOfTopic|Cycling in Europe|Benelux}}\\n\\n{{outlinetopic}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Devils Tower banner.jpg|pgname=Devils Tower National Monument}}\\n'''Devils Tower National Monument''' (''Mato Tipila'' in Lakota) is a [[United States National Monument|national monument]] in Crook County, [[Northeast Wyoming]]. The monument is the core of an ancient volcano; the surrounding softer rock has over time been eroded to reveal cooled magma hardened into igneous rock, appearing as fluted shafts and columns rising over 500 feet (150 m) in the air. The monolithic tower rises above the Belle Fourche River at the edge of the Black Hills region, known in this section as the Bear Lodge Mountains.  The monument was established as the first national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906.\\n[[File:Flaganddevilstower.jpg|thumb|270px|Devils Tower National Monument.]]\\nThis landmark is traditionally sacred to several Native American tribes including Lakota, Arapaho, Shoshone, Cheyenne, and Crow tribes. It is managed as a U.S. National Park and is open to the public, but travel here for non-Indigenous tourists requires awareness and respect for these sacred grounds. \\n\\n==Understand==\\n\\n===History===\\n\\nDevils Tower was known as \\\"Mateo Tipi\\\" by Native Americans of the region, and is considered sacred. \\\"Mateo Tipi\\\" translates as \\\"Bear Lodge\\\", as the Indian legend revolves around the creation of the tower as a refuge for a group of Indian youths being pursued by a giant bear. Imploring the great spirit to save them, a rock they were standing on began to rise into the air. The bear tried to reach them, with its claws carving the fluted columns into the rock. The youths then were taken up and became what is known as the seven sisters constellation. A U.S. cavalry scouting party reached the tower in 1876 and incorrectly translated the name to mean \\\"Bad God's Tower\\\", and thus its present name remains.\\n\\nDevils Tower is a popular place for rock climbing, hiking, and as a tourist waypoint between popular destinations such as [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]], [[Badlands National Park]], [[Yellowstone National Park]] and [[Grand Teton National Park]].  \\n\\nIt is probably best known as the location of the alien-human rendezvous point in Steven Spielberg's 1977 science fiction film, ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''.  Production designer Joe Alves traveled the west looking for a proper landmark and stumbled across the obscure park finding it a perfect fit for use in the film. Devils Tower National Monument is administered by the National Park Service, a part of the Department of Interior.\\n\\n===Landscape===\\n\\nThe one obvious contrast in landscape here is jarringly weird, and indeed the main attraction! Devils Tower is one of the world's most striking natural monoliths in no small part for its sheer, vertical form, and its dramatic contrast with the rolling prairie extending in all directions for seemingly endless distances (the rolling prairie being essentially a lower extension of the nearby [[Badlands and Black Hills|Black Hills]] in [[South Dakota]]).\\n\\nThe tower is the eroded remnant of a giant laccolith\\u2014an igneous intrusion produced by rising molten magma exploiting a weak point in the existing sedimentary rock layers about 65 million years ago. Over the epochs since, the softer sandstones and shales that covered and surrounded the intrusion (which had pushed them up), leaving us with this alien-attracting, arrestive tower. The tower is made of constantly-eroding polygonal columns of phonolite lava (similar to the columnar basalt found at the [[Giant's Causeway]] in [[Northern Ireland]], as well as at [[Devils Postpile National Monument]] in [[California]]).\\n\\n[[File:DevilsTowerCloseupByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|300px|A close up of the polygonal columns of phonolite surrounding the tower]]\\n\\nYou might notice that the forest rolling along the hills is a little repetitive. The lack of diversity was caused by fire suppression by ranchers, settlers, and by the U.S. Forest and Park Services, as a means of avoiding fires spreading to settled areas and the burning down of the valuable and beautiful forests. But without the natural cycle renewal caused by (natural) forest fires, the Ponderosa pine has taken over, depriving any smaller ground plants from getting needed sunlight. The Park Service has been undertaking prescribed burns to try and restore the rich, diverse ecosystem that once prevailed.\\n\\n===Flora and fauna===\\n\\nPrairie falcons nest on the monument, and some climbing trails are closed yearly to protect the nestlings.  Annual information about closings is available on the National Park Service web site.\\n\\nThe meadows on the approach roads to the tower are the home to colonies of Prairie Dogs.  Do not approach them because of the risk of contracting rabies if bitten.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{climate\\n| align = none\\n| units = imperial\\n| janhigh =   34    | febhigh =   38    | marhigh =   47    | aprhigh =   58\\n| mayhigh =   67    | junhigh =   77    | julhigh =   86    | aughigh =   85\\n| sephigh =   74    | octhigh =   60    | novhigh =   45    | dechigh =   34\\n| janlow =    6     | feblow =    10    | marlow =    20    | aprlow =    28\\n| maylow =    38    | junlow =    48    | jullow =    54    | auglow =    52\\n| seplow =    40    | octlow =    29    | novlow =    17    | declow =    6\\n| janprecip = 0.6   | febprecip = 0.6   | marprecip = 1.2   | aprprecip = 1.7\\n| mayprecip = 2.7   | junprecip = 3.1   | julprecip = 2.1   | augprecip = 1.7\\n| sepprecip = 1.4   | octprecip = 1.6   | novprecip = 0.8   | decprecip = 0.6\\n| description = {{ForecastNOAA|Devil's Tower|44.5833|-104.7147}} &#160;&#160; Data from [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/normals NOAA (1981-2010)]\\n}}\\n===Visitor information===\\n* [https://www.nps.gov/deto/index.htm Park website]\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Devils Tower National Monument Visitor Center | alt= | url=https://www.nps.gov/deto/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm | email=\\n| address= | lat=44.5903 | long=-104.7207 | directions=at the end of the park road, 3 miles from the entrance station\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| lastedit=2020-07-02\\n| content=The Devils Tower National Monument Visitor Center has interpretive exhibits, and the Devils Tower Natural History Association bookstore and souvenir shop.

However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\\n\\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to [[Costa Daurada]], north to [[Costa Brava]] or out to sea for the [[Balearic Islands]].\\n\\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low. Given the high humidity, {{convert|19|-|23|\\u00b0C|0}} is considered comfortable weather, which is usually the temperature from May to June, and from late August to October. These are the best times to visit the city.  Anything warmer than this can feel too hot, and the period from November to April is quite chilly and at times gloomy.\\n\\n===With children===\\nToddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain. In any public place, people around you will make every effort possible to make your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them.

Fa\\u00e7ana de la Passi\\u00f3.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia church by Antoni Gaud\\u00ed is perhaps the most known landmark of Barcelona]]\\n\\nBarcelona's official languages are [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] and [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]. About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese. On the other hand, FGC announcements \\u2013 either regular or disruptions \\u2013 will be made only in Catalan, and disruption announcements on RENFE's network will usually be made only in Spanish. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a separate Romance language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.\\n\\nYou might find some locals answer in Catalan after being asked in Spanish, that's not because they are being rude but because they assume you are bilingual. In Catalonia, it's not uncommon to hear people code switching between different languages in the same conversation. In case you can't understand what they are saying, tell them you don't speak Catalan and politely ask them to repeat it in Spanish or English.\\n\\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia is a large scale immigration process from the rest of Spain, which occurred over the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language, and 40% use Catalan. The issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere.\\n\\nIn tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak English. If you are a native English speaker, you will have few problems, as Barcelona hosts many tourists.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\n[[File:Aeropuerto de Barcelona (1322744358).jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona International Airport]]\\nThe main airport is {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona El Prat|wikidata=Q56973}} ({{IATA|BCN}}). Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use the airports of ''[[Girona]]'' ({{IATA|GRO}}), nearly {{km|100}} to the north, or ''[[Reus]]'' ({{IATA|REU}}), around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair started operating at BCN, you should check carefully where your flight goes. The three-letter IATA code should be part of your booking process.\\n\\n====Barcelona International Airport====\\n{{main|Barcelona El Prat Airport}}\\n\\n[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Barcelona/en/Barcelona-El-Prat.html Barcelona International Airport] ({{IATA|BCN}}), also known as '''El Prat''', is a major transport hub, with flights from all over Europe and beyond, is by far the closest airport to the city. To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for \\u20ac5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs \\u20ac12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport) , tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (\\u20ac7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya on its way to Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya. See the Public Transport section in Get Around below for more information on tickets & passes as there were major changes in 2023.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Girona-Costa-Brava/en/Home.html Girona\\u2013Costa Brava Airport]====\\nThe Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estaci\\u00f3 del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport, synchronised with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs \\u20ac16 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac25. The journey takes approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Timetables are available [http://www.sagales.com/index.php?nIdioma=LANG3 online]. You can also take a train (you can choose between local ''Rodalies'', ''Media Distancia'' and high speed  AVE trains with different travel times and price points) to Girona main train station and a local bus from there to the airport.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Reus/en/ Reus Airport]====\\nThe easiest way is to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs \\u20ac13 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac24. The journey takes from 1 hr 30 min to 1 hr 45 min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available [http://www.igualadina.com/pdfs/REUS%20AIRPORT.pdf? online]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs \\u20ac7.25 and then the bus costs \\u20ac2.5. This takes about 2\\u00bd hours. Train timetables can be checked at Renfe's [http://www.renfe.com website] and the bus timetable is available at the [http://www.reustransport.cat/pdf/L50.pdf website]{{Dead link|date=November 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} of Reus public transport.\\n\\n[[File:Estacio Barcelona Sants - 1 - 2010-10-18 - JTCurses.jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona Sants railway station]]\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:RENFE AVE S-103 15.jpg|thumbnail|right|Superfast trains will whiz you to Barcelona from across Spain and France]]\\n\\nBarcelona is well-connected to the Spanish railway network, and to the rest of Europe. High-speed trains run frequently from main station {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona Sants|wikidata=Q800453|lat=41.37911238|long=2.139878268|url=https://www.adif.es/w/71801-barcelona-sants}} (in the southwest of the city) to Madrid, Seville and Malaga. There are also regular long-distance connections that partially use high-speed infrastructure to all major Spanish cities. The station is also served by many regional lines including {{rint|catalonia|rdc}}{{rint|catalonia|r1}}{{rint|catalonia|r2}}{{rint|catalonia|r2s}}{{rint|catalonia|r2n}}{{rint|catalonia|r3}}{{rint|catalonia|r4}}{{rint|catalonia|r11}}\\n\\nThe historic {{marker|type=go|name=Estaci\\u00f3 de Fran\\u00e7a|wikidata=Q800449}} now mostly serves regional trains.\\n\\nDirect regular [https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-europe/tgv-inoui-espagne/ high-speed train service] goes to destinations in France. In addition to two daily TGV services from [[Paris]] (travel time ~7 hr to Barcelona), there is a daily service from [[Lyon]] (5 hr), and a daily service from [[Marseille]] (4 hr). Prices start at \\u20ac39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\\n\\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerb\\u00e8re/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\\n\\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7\\u20138 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly \\u20ac30.\\n\\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called ''[http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/larga_distancia/productos/trenhotel.html Trenhotel]'' between Barcelona and Paris. ''Trenhotels'' still do, however, run between Barcelona and [[Granada]], [[A Coru\\u00f1a]] and [[Vigo]].\\n\\nThe security checks are taken seriously and may take some time.

Operation times are 05:00&ndash;24:00 (M&ndash;Th), 05:00&ndash;02:00 (F), and continuous service from Saturday at 05:00 until Sunday at midnight. Stations are marked {{rint|barcelona|metro}} on most maps; every station has a detailed map of exits to the city. Trains are fast, often coming in two minute intervals. However, on holidays and weekends trains only run every 6-8 minutes and can get easily packed. Announcements are made only in Catalan, though signs and ticketing machines generally include Spanish and English too.\\n\\n[[File:Bitllet T-10 (ATM \\u00c0rea de Barcelona).svg|thumb|right|The '''T-10 (1 zone)''' is the discontinued paper ticket. Partially replaced by T-casual]]\\n\\nPay attention to the fact that to get from metro lines operated by TMB ({{rint|barcelona|l1}}, {{rint|barcelona|l2}}, {{rint|barcelona|l3}}, {{rint|barcelona|l4}}, {{rint|barcelona|l5}}, {{rint|barcelona|l9}}/{{rint|barcelona|l10}} and {{rint|barcelona|l11}}) to the ones operated by FGC ({{rint|barcelona|l6}}, {{rint|barcelona|l7}} and {{rint|barcelona|l8}}), or vice versa, you need to exit and then enter through a new pay-gate. In this case, if you had a one-journey ticket, you need to get a new one. If you used a multiple journey ticket you won't be charged for a second time when changing lines as long as you are within the stated travel time for a single journey. Also, you can't repeat operator, so you can't use a FGC ride to make a shortcut. For instance: changing to L9S to L1 via L8 using Fira and Espanya will charge you with two journeys, you should go via Torrassa instead although its way longer. All trains are air-conditioned, but the metro stations themselves are not, so beware because the stations can become very hot during summer months.\\n\\nAlso be aware when travelling to/from the airport by Metro line L9 Sud: while the T-casual is valid for {{rint|catalonia|rdc}} {{rint|catalonia|r2n}} Renfe services (or buses), it is not accepted for the {{rint|barcelona|metro}} Metro. If you use the Metro line L9 Sud to and from the airport using a T-casual ticket, you'll be forced to pay the full fare, which is \\u20ac5.50, and the ticket you've used will not be refunded.\\n\\n====By tram====\\n\\nThere are two main sets of tram lines, Trambaix {{rint|barcelona|t1}}{{rint|barcelona|t2}}{{rint|barcelona|t3}} towards the North West of the city and Trambes\\u00f2s {{rint|barcelona|t4}}{{rint|barcelona|t5}}{{rint|barcelona|t6}} towards the East of the city near the coast. There are interchange points with other modes of transport. These lines are run by [https://www.tram.cat/en Tram] {{rint|barcelona|trambaix}} and all lines are in zone 1.\\n\\nThere is one other tramway run by TMB but is not part of the integrated ticketing system: [https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona/other-transport-tmb/tramvia-blau-tibidabo Tramvia Blau]. This is a historic tram that connects to the Tibidabo Funecular. Unfortunately in 2024 it is closed for maintenance with bus 196 available as a replacement.\\n\\n====By train====\\n\\nRegional suburban trains run through Barcelona and share ticketing with the modes of transport above. There are two operators: RENFE and FGC. Wrongly ignored by some tourists, they provide a useful additional mode of transport for getting across the city or connecting with mainline rail services and the airport.\\n\\nThe trains run by RENFE share tracks with mainline trains and are called Rodalies {{rint|catalonia|rdc}} (known in the rest of Spain as Cercan\\u00edas).

Perhaps the best option in planning your route is to consult with one of the route planners mentioned above.\\n\\nA major reorganisation of bus lines was completed in November 2018, so disregard old bus schedules and recheck routes. For example, bus line 92 to Park G\\u00fcell, used by many tourists to get there after a visit to the Sagrada Familia, has been suspended, and a new line V15 stops there but takes a different route through the city centre (Passeig de Sant Joan).\\n\\nHere are some tips for bus line codes:\\n\\n* Hxx lines run parallel to the coastline, low numbers run on the high side, high numbers on the sea side.\\n* Vxx lines run from the beach to the hills, high numbers on the northern side (Bes\\u00f2s), low numbers on the southern (Llobregat).\\n* Dxx lines run in a somewhat diagonal path, although interestingly none of these cover neither Diagonal or Meridiana avenues, the main oblique streets.\\n* Mxx lines are found at the outer perimeter of metro coverage and link a metro stop to a neighbourhood lacking metro service.\\n* Bxx lines run on the northern area outside Barcelona or linking Barcelona to neighbouring municipalities in the metropolitan area, B stands for Bes\\u00f2s river.\\n* Lxx lines run on the southern area alike Bxx lines, L stands for Llobregat river.\\n* Some municipalities have lines fully inside the town limits with two letters and a digit, theses two letters are reminiscent of the town name, such as BDx for Badalona and LHx for L'Hospitalet\\n* Nxx lines run only at night when all other lines do not run, roughly from 23:00 to 6:00.\\n* Cxx lines link Barcelona the various northern coastal Maresme towns up to [[Matar\\u00f3]].\\n* Exx lines are express buses from Barcelona to various municipalities {{km|10-60}} outside of the metropolitan area.\\n* Lines with one or two digits without any letter follow historical routes from before the H-V-D schema.\\n* Lines between 100 and 199 are usually very local lines served with low-capacity cars and poor frequency, 30 min or worse. Notable cases are line 111 to the Tibidabo amusement park, line 120 through Ciutat Vella, and line 150 to Olympic venues and the Montju\\u00efc castle; others are mostly useless for tourists.\\n* Line numbers from 200 upwards are used for some routes going outside the metropolitan area, while some others of the same kind have no number at all.\\n\\nBuses H-V-D run about every 6\\u201312 min weekdays, 15\\u201320 min weekends. \\n\\nNitbus (N) run every 20 min all night.

It takes little over an hour to walk from Port Vell at the seaside to Park G\\u00fcell at the foothills of the mountain range at the northeastern end of the city, and you can see a range of attractions, including La Rambla and Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia, on your way. There are opportunities all around to sit down and enjoy a drink or a meal everywhere. If you are fit, you can pretty much explore the city by foot alone, unless the heat beats you in the warmer months (and then you can always resort to the air-conditioned metro).\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (\\u20ac3/hour, \\u20ac20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\\n\\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, ''Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes'' is actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\\n\\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\\n* Near ''Moll de Sant Bertran'' (which is south-west from ''Museu Maritim'') - driving at B\\u201310, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\\n* Somewhere near Guell Park.\\n* Near Font M\\u00e0gica, in Pla\\u00e7a Espanya and the Montju\\u00efc hill.\\n\\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.\\n\\n=== By taxi ===\\nAs of January 2019, [[Ride-sharing and carsharing services|ride-sharing services]] such as Uber require at least one hour's notice. For less than one hour's notice, you need to call a regular taxi.\\n\\n==See==\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500}}\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n{{infobox|What to see in the dark|The most spectacular sights in the night are:\\n* ''Musical fountains'', in Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.

Small corner stores are the most visible on city streets, but tend to mark up prices in exchange for convenience.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nAs with all cities which welcome large numbers of tourists, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, but there are plenty of restaurants serving excellent food at very reasonable prices, if you know where to look. The usual rules of thumb apply: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track used by fellow travellers, and seek out caf\\u00e9s and restaurants which the locals frequent. In practice, this usually involves searching out eateries in residential districts away from the main sightseeing attractions. Avoid restaurants with touts outside, and have a basic understanding of the traditional foods served in restaurants, as well as the local drinks. One slightly crafty way of sussing a place's authenticity at a glance is to take note of how they spell a certain word: a menu board advertising ''tap'''a'''s'', written the Spanish/international way, is likely to be somewhere which primarily caters to tourists, whereas somewhere offering ''tap'''e'''s'', using Catalan spelling, is in all probability a venue frequented by locals.\\n\\nSome districts to check out include [[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]], which is a hub of quality, affordable Catalan cooking of both the traditional and more avant-garde varieties, and the [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]], whose chic boulevards have upscale restaurants aplenty worthy of your splurge money. The fishing quarter of Barceloneta (in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]) is an example of a neighbourhood where it pays to be picky: closer to the gentrified seafront, a slew of mojito beach bar-style places serve up expensive tourist tapas; for the real thing, head into the backstreets, where many traditional bars are still tucked away. In all cases, be prepared to \\\"promenade\\\" in search of the most attractive-looking menu; that's what the locals do, after all.\\n\\n{{infobox|Where to eat during siesta|The majority of restaurants and cafes are closed 16:00-20:00 for ''migdiada''. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:\\n* tapas in bars\\n* international chains\\n* food stands in market halls}}\\n\\n'''Set menus (men\\u00fa del migdia / men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda)''' Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a ''men\\u00fa del migdia'' / ''men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' (menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for \\u20ac12 to \\u20ac20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 14:00 to 16:00. The savvy traveller will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve ''platos combinados'', which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.\\n\\n'''Smoking''' is not permitted inside bars and restaurants since 2011, but it's usually allowed in terraces.\\n\\n===Dishes===\\n[[File:Tapas Barcelona.jpg|thumb|250px|A plate of ''tapes'']]\\n\\nYou can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.\\n\\n''See [[Catalonia#Catalan Cuisine|Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article]].''\\n\\nThe selection of '''seafood''' is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).\\n\\nA treat to try that no travel guide mentions is '''waffles''' sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\\n\\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\\n\\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of '''durum''' or '''shawarma''' stands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around \\u20ac5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the '''Asian''' selection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants, while '''Latin American''' offerings, particularly Argentine and [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], are well-represented too.\\n\\n===Food tours===\\n\\nIf you feel lost in the variety of food choices there are \\u2013 Catalan, Basque, Spanish, and beyond \\u2013 it may be helpful to do a food tour to quickly get oriented.

Chupitos is Spanish for \\\"shots\\\" and offers hundreds of unique shots including the \\\"Harry Potter\\\" (a shot that sparks as cinnamon is sprinkled over it), and \\\"Monica Lewinsky\\\" (a variety of flaming shots) among others. As much a show as it is a place to get a drink, it's a fun night out.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n[[File:Hotel Vela (8698052023).jpg|thumbnail|right|The sail-shaped hotel W Barcelona is one of the city's newest landmarks]]\\n\\nBarcelona offers a great range of accommodations, from cheap, decent apartments, hostels and guest-houses to five-star hotels. Every district has plentiful offerings, and thanks to the efficient public transportation you can stay comfortably in any of them, depending on your budget and preferences.\\n\\nDuring festivals (see [[#Festivals and events|Festivals and events]] above), especially during [http://www.mobileworldcongress.com Mobile World Congress], which is a major trade show at the Fira, accommodation in Barcelona and especially near the Fira is much more difficult to find and more expensive than usual.\\n\\n* [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella#Sleep|Ciutat Vella]] offers a mix of luxury hotels and cheerful hostels within a dense urban environment.

Wi-Fi is widely available in public places and on transport.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Pickpockets===\\n\\n[[Pickpockets|Pickpocketing]] is the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona. '''Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents''' in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\\n\\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\\n* At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\\n* A milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\\n* East Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \\\"martial arts\\\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\\n* These people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\\n* Male travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\\n* In the '''subway''', a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance ''and'' exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\\n* Under no circumstances should you '''leave your items''' unattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\\n\\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can [https://denuncies.dgp.interior.gencat.cat/denuncies/ file a report online] if you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices.\\n\\n===Scams===\\n{{Seealso|Common scams}}\\n\\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\\n\\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of [[common scams#Overcharging|methods]] are employed, including the [[common scams#No-change_trick|No-change trick]]. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.\\n\\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\\n\\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\\n\\nA version of [[common scams#Three Card Monte|Three Card Monte]] is one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\\n\\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you.\\n\\n===Violent crimes===\\n\\nIn 2019 there was a surge in violent crimes around Barcelona: in just the summer, there were almost as many violent deaths as there were for the whole previous year. While tourists are only occasionally targeted (and almost exclusively simple robberies), this should be not a going concern, many of these deaths are either drug-related or take place during drunken fights, so you are best advised to avoid such situations.\\n\\n===Football===\\nLocal club '''FC Barcelona''' (also known as \\\"Bar\\u00e7a\\\", a term used by locals to refer strictly to the club and not the city) is seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and has a very heated and politically-charged rivalry with Real Madrid, which is seen as a symbol of the Spanish state and ruling establishment, and violent confrontations between the supporters of both clubs have been known to occur. Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\\n\\nFurthermore, the local ''Derbi barcelon\\u00ed'' between FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain. If you hear Bar\\u00e7a and Espanyol fans having an argument, be careful, as things can quickly escalate.\\n\\n===ATMs===\\nBarcelona offers ATMs in many locations. Many provide a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.), and most accept ATM/debit/credit cards of various banks. Choose an ATM in a secure or highly-public space (e.g., in a bank lobby or airport terminal) to avoid machines modified by criminals to skim/video your card data or where you might be robbed after use.  Ensure early in usage that the ATM supports a language you understand. For a full discussion of safe/effective charge/debit/ATM card usage and their cost trade-offs, see also [[Money]]. They will charge you a usage fee on top of anything your bank charges you which should be declared on the screen before you proceed (2,90\\u20ac for a 500\\u20ac withdrawal as of Oct. 2024 across different banks).\\n\\n===Areas of caution===\\n\\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (''cercanias'' in Spanish or ''rodalies'' in Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\\n\\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montju\\u00efc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\\n\\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\\n\\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\\n\\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\\n\\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\\n\\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.\\n\\n===Anti-tourism movement===\\n\\nMany Barcelona residents have the impression that there are too many tourists in Barcelona and that it has increased living costs, as landlords prefer to rent to tourists and not to locals to make more profit. Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024.\\n\\n===Cars===\\n\\nTourist drivers may attract special attention, such as [[common scams#Red light bag snatch|Red light bag snatch]] or [[common scams#Flat tire|Flat tire scams]]\\n\\n===Public transportation===\\n\\nBesides being a particular pickpocket hot spot, there are plenty of fare evaders who will stick to you when crossing a fare barrier. Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean ''carte blanche'' for them. The fare evasion fine is just \\u20ac50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome.\\n\\n===Reporting crimes===\\n\\nIf you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers generally do not speak English, even though the theft report form is in English, Spanish, and Catalan. The police station most often used to report theft is the one underneath Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya beside metro station, where they have some translators for common languages.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n===Hospitals===\\nEU citizens can get free or reduced cost medical treatment on presentation of an EHIC card and passport.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Hospital Clinic I Provincial De Barcelona | url= | email=\\n| address=C/ Villarroel 170 | lat= | long= | directions=Metro Stn Hospital Clinic (Line 5)\\n| phone=+34 932 275 400 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===Consulates===\\n\\n{|\\n|-\\n| style=\\\"vertical-align:top;width:50%;\\\" |\\n* {{flag|Angola}} {{listing\\n| name=Angola | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer del Consell de Cent, 413-415 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 245 02 73 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Argentina}} {{listing\\n| name=Argentina | url=http://cbarc.mrecic.gov.ar/en | email=\\n| address=Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia, 11 (08007) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 304 12 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Australia}} {{listing\\n| name=Australia | url=http://spain.embassy.gov.au/madr/home.html | email=ausconbcn@gmail.com\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 433 Bis, Second Floor, Door 1 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 362 3792 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Austria}} {{listing\\n| name=Austria | url= | email=barcelona@consuladodeaustria.com\\n| address=Carrer de Mari\\u00e0 Cub\\u00ed, 7 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 368 60 03 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bangladesh}} {{listing\\n| name=Bangladesh | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Londres, 35 (08029) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 410 83 89 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belgium}} {{listing\\n| name=Belgium |alt=| url=http://www.diplomatie.be/barcelonafr/default.asp?id=31&mnu=31 | email=barcelona@diplobel.fed.be\\n| address=Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 680 (08010) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 80 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n|wikidata=|lastedit=2020-08-05| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belize}} {{listing\\n| name=Belize | url= | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 469 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 430 30 44 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Benin}} {{listing\\n| name=Benin | url=http://www.consuladobenin.com/ | email=consuladobenein@terra.es\\n| address=Carrer d'Arag\\u00f3, 290 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bolivia}} {{listing\\n| name=Bolivia | url=http://consuladodeboliviaenbarcelona.es/ | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Roger de Flor, 3 (08018) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 322 65 12 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Brazil}} {{listing\\n| name=Brazil | url=http://www.brasilbcn.org/ | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 468 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 488 22 88 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bulgaria}} {{listing\\n| name=Bulgaria | alt= | url=https://www.mfa.bg/es/embassies/spain-barcelona | email=Consulate.Barcelona@mfa.bg\\n| address=Avinguda de la Riera de Cassoles, 54 (08012) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 937 969 950 | tollfree= | fax=+34 937 969 949\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Burkina Faso}} {{listing\\n| name=Burkina Faso | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Muntaner, 261 (08021) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 93 200 99 09 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Canada}} {{listing\\n| name=Canada | url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/spain-espagne/offices-bureaux/consul_barcelona.aspx | email=bclna@internacional.gc.ca\\n| address=Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, 9 (08002) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 412 72 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|France}} {{listing\\n| name=France | url=http://www.consulfrance-barcelone.org/ | email=info@consulfrance-barcelone.org\\n| address=Ronda Universitat 22 bis -

Trace your steps back half a mile, then continue southwest towards Playa Garraf. Playa Grarraf is right by the Garraf train station, allowing easy access back to Barcelona.)\\n*[[Pyrenees]] - A mountain range around {{km|150}} north from the city.\\n*[https://www.visitsantcugat.cat/en/ Sant Cugat del Valles] - Has one of the most interesting Romanesque cloisters in Catalunya, with many interesting carvings. The town itself is full of expensive vilas.\\n* [[Sitges]] - A traditional beachside destination for the locals. Full of fashion shops open on Sundays.

Having a plan of what you want to do and an idea of the \\\"lay of the land\\\" before heading out can also save a lot of time. If you've only got one weekend you can't afford to spend a day just to get oriented.\\n\\nAs intercontinental travel no longer costs a fortune, few destinations are once-in-a-lifetime.\\n\\nOn a multi-stop journey or a road trip, transportation takes much time away from time on the destinations. Detours from your main destination might be a waste of time. If you have a few days in [[Rome]], the historical city centre is enough to keep you busy. Even though [[Metropolitan Naples]] has famous attractions such as [[Vesuvio]] and [[Pompeii]], it is wise to leave them for another visit.\\n\\n[[Time zones]] can work for and against a traveller. When you fly westwards, you \\\"borrow\\\" hours, and might arrive around the same time as you took off. [[Jet lag]] can be a stress factor, though.\\n\\nPublic holidays and school vacations are times when many people travel. Plan for this in advance to avoid surprises. Look for websites with this information \\u2013 for example on [https://www.schulferien.org/ school vacations in Germany]. Countries such as Germany deliberately stagger their school holiday season to relieve congestion on major North-South routes that bring travellers to popular summer destinations along the North and Baltic Sea Coast and in Italy. Countries like France on the other hand have one single day on which all school kids in the entire country start their summer holidays. Try to avoid traveling on that day if you can.\\n\\nCarrying, packing and unpacking excessive [[baggage]] slows down the journey. Flying without check-in baggage allows you to skip the baggage claim area (unless there is no room for your cabin bag and you are forced to check it in). A heavy suitcase might require detours around staircases and passages.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{seealso|Planning your flight|Arriving in a new city}}\\n\\n[[Flying]] is the fastest way to travel long distances. Direct flights are fastest. Multiple-leg flights can differ a lot in total time; use [[aggregators]] to evaluate them against each other.\\n\\nRemember to add your time to get to airport, check in, get through security, clear [[border crossing|border checkpoints]], go to baggage claim if necessary, get to the exit and then get from the airport to wherever you're staying; all of this can add a few extra hours to the journey, making driving or taking a train or bus as quick and more flexible on journey start time for medium length journeys. Check which airport is closest to the city centre. Some cities have more than one airport and one may be located just a few kilometres from the city centre while the other airport is located in the suburbs. Airports like [[Hahn]] are famously nowhere close to cities they are named after, but even places like [[Munich Airport]] can be almost an hour by public transit from the downtown of the city they serve. Others like Taipei Songshan Airport, Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, London City Airport and Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport are so close to the city centre that it takes as little as 15 minutes to reach the downtown core of the city.\\n\\nWhen buying plane tickets that involve changes of plane, make sure you'll arrive at the second airport in time. It's rarely a smart idea to try to save half an hour by choosing an overly tight connection, because the first plane may get delayed. In the case of severe delays and if you're the only passenger the connecting flight would need to wait for, they often aren't going to wait for you even if the second flight is operated by the same airline and the journey is on the same ticket. Even if you make it to the plane, if you have checked luggage it may get left behind. Missing your connecting flight ''will'' even in the best case add hours to your trip, and in the worst case, you could get stuck for days. The same goes to some extent for other forms of transport.\\n\\nIf there is a [[rail travel|rail line]], particularly [[high speed rail]] between two destinations no further than 500 kilometres apart, it is usually faster than flying. In addition, most train stations are in the center of cities or at least much closer to the center than many airports. In Europe and East Asia, railways and airlines are increasingly aggressive in their competition on both speed and price on many busy routes.\\n\\nWhen estimating [[driving]] time, navigation apps usually assume that the driver will drive at the maximum allowed speed. Considering the risk of slow traffic and [[severe weather]] and the need for regular breaks, you might want to dedicate twice the nominal time to reach your destination on long trips, or perhaps even more when driving alone or when there is only one available driver.\\n\\nThink about what you can do during the journey. Flying may be the quickest way of reaching the destination, but even with a window seat you won't see much of the country. Taking a train or coach may be much slower, but what you can see from the window (or even just the vehicle and the people around you, in more exotic environments) may be a valuable part of the experience. On a business trip, if you have a reserved seat on a train, you may be able to prepare for your meeting for most of the journey. If a train takes four hours in a comfortable seat with reliable Wi-Fi whereas a plane takes the same four hours hustling and bustling around through security and taxis with barely a minute to sit down and get the laptop open, that's a good reason to prefer the train.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nIn cities, [[public transportation]] is usually an efficient method to get around. However, transit systems work very differently. Some have long delays or shutdowns. The schematic route maps also rarely give a realistic impression of the time needed for a journey, although quite a few transit systems provide estimated trip times and schedules on their websites.\\n\\nEspecially when you drive, but for other means of transport as well, avoid rush hours. In most urban areas, these are 7\\u20139 AM, and 4\\u20136 PM.  However, for some tourist destinations, such as California's [[wine country]], or any popular beach town, the \\\"rush hour\\\" might start on Friday evening and end on Sunday night. In addition, some big cities, like New York, have extended rush hours that can last most of the afternoon and evening, and any time of day in Paris or Los Angeles is somewhat likely to have bad traffic. In general, even in the rare cases that driving in major cities is faster than public transit, it often tires you faster and leaves you with less energy to do something fun. You can study a map or guidebook on public transit while heading somewhere. You can't do that while driving, but you could delegate this task to a trusty passenger.\\n\\nOn a [[road trip]], plan your route to avoid passing through large metropolitan areas, unless you are planning to visit them. Above all avoid going through them at rush hour.\\n\\n[[Spectator sports]], festivals and other big events can also congest traffic. One method is to have accommodation near the venue, or to arrive early and spend time within walking distance. Parades can really ruin traffic, as streets are reserved for festivities, and fireworks displays on major holidays such as New Year's Eve or a country's Independence Day often involve closing large segments of superhighways, so that spectators can set up lawn chairs or stand in the lanes to watch. Many cities have websites that list all scheduled parades for the year.\\n\\nIf you are using large rental car companies, use their member cards. These will have your driving license and credit card on record. After the first time used, you will not need to stand in line at the counter and fill out paperwork.  Simply walk directly to your booked car and show member card and license at the exit.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n[[Street food]], fast food or a ready-made meal from a supermarket can save time, as well as packing [[camping food]] such as sandwiches, bananas, or nutrition bars (with the consideration that baggage slows you down).\\n\\nEating in a vehicle saves time, and might in some cases be an enjoyable experience (a gourmet meal in a railroad dining car, or on a cruise ferry). While airline food has become better than its reputation, portions are rather small. Eating in [[public transportation]] vehicles and [[taxis]] is sometimes prohibited, and usually bad manners.\\n\\nIn many restaurants, there can be a big difference in the waiting time for different dishes. Some fast food restaurants have a screen showing which dishes they have ready and can give you immediately. For instance the fresh fish may take 25 minutes to be cooked from scratch, but the stew may be ready to be dished in the kitchen. The \\\"meal of the day\\\", where such are offered, is usually served quite fast. Usually your group will all be served at once, so one slow dish can hold everybody up. Ask the waiting staff for suggestions to have a quick meal, and say if you want dishes to come as soon as they are ready. However, there are some countries such as Italy where you simply can't expect to have a quick meal in a restaurant. In those places, you should consider going to a bar or snack bar (such as a d\\u00f6ner/shawarma or falafel place in some countries) if you want to have a quick hot meal.\\n\\nA buffet restaurant usually lets guests eat without waiting.\\n\\nIf waiting for a meal is unavoidable, the wait can be a good time to double check your itinerary, message local contacts about plans, use the [[toilet]] or take some photos. Prefer a restaurant which is enjoyable in its own right; where you have a comfortable seat without noise or bad smell; ideally a good view or quaint furnishing.\\n\\nAs a general principle, more expensive restaurants are intended for longer visits. A [[fine dining]] experience is intended to be around two hours or more.\\n\\nAn empty restaurant looks bad. If there are very few guests, the staff might want to lengthen your stay. Make it clear that you expect a bill as soon as the food is served so your time is spent efficiently.\\n\\n==Do==\\nIf you stay more than a day in a city, a [[guided tour]] is usually a good starter activity. It gives you an overview of the city, advice on other attractions, and possibly new companions.\\n\\nTourist attractions are usually crowded on weekends and holidays. If you have the chance, visit them on weekdays.\\n\\n[[Museums]] and other attractions vary a lot in size, and in the time needed to see them. While a small art collection can be experienced in a few minutes, you could easily spend a week visiting a large institution such as the [[Louvre]].\\n\\n==Drink==\\nAlways have a bottle of [[water]] or juice with you to avoid spending time searching for a place to get it. At the airport remember to purchase after the last security check area, or bring an empty bottle that you can fill at the airport.\\n\\n==Buy==\\nYou can save time if you are careful to bring all [[equipment]] you need from home, instead of buying it at the destination. This makes your baggage heavier, though.\\n\\nHigh-end hotels have a convenience store or a travel store on site. If not, you should scout out a supermarket or other supply store nearby.\\n\\n[[Shopping]] takes time, and makes baggage heavier. If you want souvenirs or other things to take home, wait until the end of the journey, when you know how much time and money you can spare, and have a sense for local price levels. This way, you minimize the distance you need to carry your souvenirs.\\n\\n[[Bargaining]], or going between stores to find a better deal, is not always worth it if your time is valuable.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\nWhile sleep deprivation is a health hazard (and will usually ruin your travel experience) you could save some time and money if you sleep on a train, bus, plane, or ship. See [[Sleeper trains]], [[Bus travel#Sleep|Bus travel]] and [[Ferries#Sleep|Ferries]] for advice.\\n\\nBeing well-rested before a journey is usually a good start.\\n\\nHotel loyalty cards can save time at check-in. In the morning there is often a wait to check out, particularly in Europe on a business day. Consider checking out and settling your bill the night before when this is possible, then simply handing over your key in the morning (ignoring the queue). Most hotels are fine with this.\\n\\nChoose where you are going to stay carefully. You may save time if you choose a hotel which is close to public transport connections, perhaps next to an urban rail station which is on several different routes. In huge cities, Wikivoyage provides district articles. They will usually give you a feel for what awaits you in each part of town. If you're looking for avant-garde artists, bars that are open until sunup and a slightly unkempt but charming look, you're better off in [[Berlin/East Central]] than in [[Berlin/Reinickendorf and Spandau]] meanwhile if \\\"quiet\\\" is what you're after, you should likely avoid [[Berlin/Mitte]].\\n\\n==See also==\\nIn many ways, saving time is in opposition and contrast to [[budget travel]], but there are sometimes options that save both time and money.\\n{{outlinetopic}}\\n\\n{{PartOfTopic|Concerns}}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.5900280477950645, "reason": "The actual output correctly identifies January and February as off-season like the expected output, but introduces additional details about temperatures and other months, which are not present in the expected output.

Its population was 36,000 in the 2020 census. Its main attraction is beaches.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:SanLuisBatangasjf2021 11.JPG|thumb|Town plaza]]\\nThe town is typical for the Philippines with a lovely Catholic church, a market, quite a few candelarias serving cheap Philippine food, and not much else.\\n\\nOutside town there are a number of beach resorts with the usual amenities. Most have boats available for diving trips out to nearby reefs. There is also one public beach where you can swim without paying a resort entry fee.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{Mapframe}}\\nThere are two highways to San Luis. The usual route is from [[Taal]] or [[Lemery]] either by [[jeepney]] or car. That highway is short and in good shape; traffic is rarely horrible but often heavy enough to be somewhat annoying. Beyond San Luis it continues south along the coast to Balite.\\n\\nThe other highway leads to [[Bauan]] where it connects to the main highway between Lemery and [[Batangas City]]; if you are coming from Batangas, this is the shortest route. That highway is two-lane blacktop, mostly good but with a few rough patches, does not wind much, and generally carries only light traffic.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\n==See==\\n[[File:SanLuisChurchjf1924 10.JPG|thumb|San&nbsp;Isidro Labrador Parish&nbsp;Church]]\\n* {{see\\n| name=San Isidro Labrador Parish Church | alt= | url=https://www.facebook.com/PSILsanluis/ | email=\\n| address=Bauan\\u2014San Luis Rd | lat=13.8549 | long=120.9179 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=<!--does this listing pass [[WV:WORSHIP]]?-->.\\n}}\\n\\n==Do==\\n* {{do\\n| name=Beach | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n==Buy==\\n* {{buy\\n| name=Public market | alt= | url= | email=\\n| address=Bauan\\u2014San Luis Rd at San Luis Coastal Road | lat=13.8548 | long=120.9165 | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| wikidata=\\n| lastedit=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n==Eat==\\n* {{eat\\n| name=Caf\\u00e9 Stefania | alt= | url=https://www.facebook.com/CafeStefaniaPH | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=in Malibiran Resort\\n| phone= | tollfree=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=Pizza, pasta, Filipino dishes, Western-style baked goods, all the usual variations on espresso.

Although none of these items are sold in San Luis, it bears this part of its name.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By bus===\\nBuses from various transportation companies leave every 20 minutes or so from the old central bus station (la central vieja) in Guadalajara.

You will reach San Luis mid-route.\\n\\n===By car===\\nFrom Guadalajara, follow the sings to Colima, Michoacan or Mazamitla, Jalisco using the interstate road Mexico 15 (Mexico 15 Mexico City \\u2013 Nogales). This road passes right through San Luis. You will start seeying signs to San Luis once outside the metropolitan area but staying on the MX 15 road. Assuming you're in central Guadalajara, it take around an hour and a half to reach San Luis. \\n\\n==Get around==\\nSan Luis is a common-size town; anyone is able to reach virtually every corner by foot.

Nestled around two of these peaks is San Luis Obispo (\\\"SLO\\\", \\\"slow\\\", or \\\"San Luis\\\" to locals), a small college town that also is one of California's oldest communities. San Luis and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing; outstanding natural beauty; a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission; a small but thriving art gallery scene; and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.\\n\\n===Getting Oriented===\\nSan Luis Obispo is bounded by the imposing line of Cuesta Ridge to the northeast, the Irish Hills to the southwest, dramatic Bishop Peak to the northwest and Islay Hill to the southeast. The town clusters around the feet of the 1,000-foot (300-meter) Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white \\\"M\\\" (for Mission High School). Both locals and visitors frequently refer to Cerro San Luis as \\\"Madonna Mountain\\\" and a common misconception is that the \\\"M\\\" represents the surname \\\"Madonna;\\\" the famous Madonna Inn sits at the foot of the mountain and the city of San Luis Obispo negotiated public access to the peak with the Madonna family. Cal Poly sits hard against Cuesta Ridge (with its big white \\\"P\\\") and the downtown area runs from Cerro San Luis roughly toward campus around two parallel streets, Higuera and Monterey. Most restaurants, bars and shops are located on Higuera Street, nearer the Mission and Cerro San Luis; hotels are mostly located on Monterey Street, nearer the university but still within a mile (2 km) of the central downtown. A few restaurants are located in the charming Railroad District, about 5 blocks east of Higuera via Santa Rosa Street, near the train station and youth hostel.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Visitors Center | alt= | url=http://visitslo.com/ | email=visitorcenter@slochamber.org\\n| address=895 Monterey St. | lat= | long= | directions=in the same building as the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, on the corner of Morro and Monterey Streets in the heart of downtown\\n| phone=+1 805 781-2777 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Su-W 10AM-5PM; Th-Sa 10AM-7PM | price=\\n| content=The Visitor Center offers San Luis Obispo city maps, visitor guides, books about San Luis Obispo, and San Luis Obispo souvenirs.

The Santa Lucia mountains and the \\\"Nine Sisters\\\" offer many beautiful views of the city and the countryside. The two most popular hikes are Bishop Peak (no bikes allowed) and Cerro San Luis (multiple biking trails). If you're interested in other mountain biking trails around the county check out the list at [http://cccmb.org/ CCCMB], a volunteer organization that creates and maintains trails countywide.\\n*Visit '''Montana de Oro State Park'''. Take Los Osos Valley Road {{convert|10|miles}} west of town to a park named one of the state's best-kept secrets by the L.A. Times a few years back, and with good reason; it's filled with an abundance of hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails both along the ocean along the bluffs and inland into the coastal peaks; a dramatic cove with caves that kids and adults love; and miles of sandy beach and tidal pools. Trails range from casual ambles along the bluffs to the steep climbs up Valencia and Oats Peaks. Oats is the longer hike (about 5.5 miles / 9 km) but more rewarding, as it offers views of Valencia against the Pacific, as well as northward and eastward to the Nine Sisters and Cuesta Ridge; the trail also is less steep. A terrific nine-mile (14-km) loop can be made by continuing over the summit to the Coon Creek trail, then crossing back in front of the range along Rattlesnake Flats Trail. Take water! The \\\"Mountain of Gold\\\" also reigns as a popular out-and-back destination for the many road cyclists in the county, but cyclists ride westward early as strong winds pick up through Los Osos Valley in the early afternoon.\\n*Walk or bike to '''Poly Canyon'''. Located on the north east side of the Cal Poly campus. Poly Canyon is a hilly, open, grassy area where many Cal Poly engineering and architecture students have constructed senior projects. The road up can be reached by taking the main road towards the Poly Canyon Village housing complex and taking a right before the road dips down the hill on a smaller road with a gate that quickly turns to dirt/gravel. Public vehicles are not allowed to drive on it, though be alert for university vehicles travelling up and down on occasion and student runners/cyclists.\\n* Kayaks and other outdoor gear can be rented at reasonable prices by students and the public from '''Poly Escapes''' on the Cal Poly campus. Kayaking is possible in many places in the county, but the most exciting place to kayak is between Shell Beach and Pismo Beach where there are sea caves you can explore.

Its central location makes it a popular extended weekend getaway for people from the San Francisco Bay Area and greater Los Angeles area.\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo County's largest city is [[San Luis Obispo]], home to California Polytechnic State University (\\\"Cal Poly\\\"). To the south of San Luis Obispo is the unincorporated community of [[Avila Beach]] and the towns of [[Arroyo Grande]] and Pismo Beach. To the north of San Luis Obispo are [[Morro Bay]] and [[Los Osos]] on the coast, and [[Atascadero]] and [[Paso Robles]] along with the county's fast-growing wine country.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[Image:Neptune Pool, Hearst Castle (5569577705).jpg|thumb|300px|Neptune Pool, Hearst Castle]]\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nHighway 101 is the main north-south highway through the county, traversing the inland portions of the county and providing the fastest route for travelers.

The northern part of the county contains every manner of amenity for travelers, ranging from chain motels to five star resorts, while the southern portion of the county is remote and accessible mainly by the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] or on foot by hikers.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Kings County]]|wikidata=Q156358}} - Located northeast of San Luis Obispo County, rural Kings County is responsible for billions of dollars of annual agricultural production, much of it from the dairy industry.  Travelers passing through on [[Interstate 5]] may find the area lacking in attractions, although there are a few hotels and other amenities in the county's small towns.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Kern County]]|wikidata=Q108047}} - Bordering San Luis Obispo County to the east, Kern County extends across a number of geographic regions: the western portion is in the [[San Joaquin Valley]], the northeastern portion is in the [[Sierra Nevada]] mountains, and the southeastern part is in the [[Desert (California)|Desert]].  Visitors to the county are most likely to be heading to [[Bakersfield]], one of California's largest cities, or traveling along Interstate 5 past oil fields and agricultural areas.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Ventura County]]|wikidata=Q108127}} - While to some extent it is an extension of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, San Luis Obispo County's neighbor to the southeast is home to rural getaways like the town of [[Ojai]] that share more with the remote Central Coast region than they do with the massive cities to the south.  While the county is heavily populated (with services to match), the Los Padres National Forest dominates the northern part of this county and provides recreational opportunities for those who want to spend time outdoors.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Santa Barbara County]]|wikidata=Q108106}} - San Luis Obispo County's southern neighbor is most famous for the town of [[Santa Barbara]] and is sometimes considered the northern boundary of Southern California. While mountains run through the region, the county is well served by a network of highways, making road trips to the many beautiful wineries a popular activity. The Danish town of [[Solvang]] is a popular destination, and rocket launches can sometimes be viewed near Vandenberg Air Force base, America's west coast spaceport.\\n\\n{{geo|35.38|-120.45|zoom=9}}\\n{{IsPartOf|Central Coast (California)}}\\n{{outlineregion}}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.8539118207171617, "reason": "The actual output accurately identifies Highway 101 as the major route to San Luis Obispo, aligning with the expected output.

Nestled around two of these peaks is San Luis Obispo (\\\"SLO\\\", \\\"slow\\\", or \\\"San Luis\\\" to locals), a small college town that also is one of California's oldest communities. San Luis and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing; outstanding natural beauty; a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission; a small but thriving art gallery scene; and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.\\n\\n===Getting Oriented===\\nSan Luis Obispo is bounded by the imposing line of Cuesta Ridge to the northeast, the Irish Hills to the southwest, dramatic Bishop Peak to the northwest and Islay Hill to the southeast. The town clusters around the feet of the 1,000-foot (300-meter) Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white \\\"M\\\" (for Mission High School). Both locals and visitors frequently refer to Cerro San Luis as \\\"Madonna Mountain\\\" and a common misconception is that the \\\"M\\\" represents the surname \\\"Madonna;\\\" the famous Madonna Inn sits at the foot of the mountain and the city of San Luis Obispo negotiated public access to the peak with the Madonna family.

Trails range from casual ambles along the bluffs to the steep climbs up Valencia and Oats Peaks. Oats is the longer hike (about 5.5 miles / 9 km) but more rewarding, as it offers views of Valencia against the Pacific, as well as northward and eastward to the Nine Sisters and Cuesta Ridge; the trail also is less steep. A terrific nine-mile (14-km) loop can be made by continuing over the summit to the Coon Creek trail, then crossing back in front of the range along Rattlesnake Flats Trail. Take water!

Its central location makes it a popular extended weekend getaway for people from the San Francisco Bay Area and greater Los Angeles area.\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo County's largest city is [[San Luis Obispo]], home to California Polytechnic State University (\\\"Cal Poly\\\"). To the south of San Luis Obispo is the unincorporated community of [[Avila Beach]] and the towns of [[Arroyo Grande]] and Pismo Beach.

The northern part of the county contains every manner of amenity for travelers, ranging from chain motels to five star resorts, while the southern portion of the county is remote and accessible mainly by the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] or on foot by hikers.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Kings County]]|wikidata=Q156358}} - Located northeast of San Luis Obispo County, rural Kings County is responsible for billions of dollars of annual agricultural production, much of it from the dairy industry.

Nestled around two of these peaks is San Luis Obispo (\\\"SLO\\\", \\\"slow\\\", or \\\"San Luis\\\" to locals), a small college town that also is one of California's oldest communities. San Luis and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing; outstanding natural beauty; a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission; a small but thriving art gallery scene; and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.\\n\\n===Getting Oriented===\\nSan Luis Obispo is bounded by the imposing line of Cuesta Ridge to the northeast, the Irish Hills to the southwest, dramatic Bishop Peak to the northwest and Islay Hill to the southeast. The town clusters around the feet of the 1,000-foot (300-meter) Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white \\\"M\\\" (for Mission High School). Both locals and visitors frequently refer to Cerro San Luis as \\\"Madonna Mountain\\\" and a common misconception is that the \\\"M\\\" represents the surname \\\"Madonna;\\\" the famous Madonna Inn sits at the foot of the mountain and the city of San Luis Obispo negotiated public access to the peak with the Madonna family. Cal Poly sits hard against Cuesta Ridge (with its big white \\\"P\\\") and the downtown area runs from Cerro San Luis roughly toward campus around two parallel streets, Higuera and Monterey. Most restaurants, bars and shops are located on Higuera Street, nearer the Mission and Cerro San Luis; hotels are mostly located on Monterey Street, nearer the university but still within a mile (2 km) of the central downtown. A few restaurants are located in the charming Railroad District, about 5 blocks east of Higuera via Santa Rosa Street, near the train station and youth hostel.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=San Luis Obispo Visitors Center | alt= | url=http://visitslo.com/ | email=visitorcenter@slochamber.org\\n| address=895 Monterey St. | lat= | long= | directions=in the same building as the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, on the corner of Morro and Monterey Streets in the heart of downtown\\n| phone=+1 805 781-2777 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Su-W 10AM-5PM; Th-Sa 10AM-7PM | price=\\n| content=The Visitor Center offers San Luis Obispo city maps, visitor guides, books about San Luis Obispo, and San Luis Obispo souvenirs.

The Santa Lucia mountains and the \\\"Nine Sisters\\\" offer many beautiful views of the city and the countryside. The two most popular hikes are Bishop Peak (no bikes allowed) and Cerro San Luis (multiple biking trails). If you're interested in other mountain biking trails around the county check out the list at [http://cccmb.org/ CCCMB], a volunteer organization that creates and maintains trails countywide.\\n*Visit '''Montana de Oro State Park'''. Take Los Osos Valley Road {{convert|10|miles}} west of town to a park named one of the state's best-kept secrets by the L.A. Times a few years back, and with good reason; it's filled with an abundance of hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails both along the ocean along the bluffs and inland into the coastal peaks; a dramatic cove with caves that kids and adults love; and miles of sandy beach and tidal pools. Trails range from casual ambles along the bluffs to the steep climbs up Valencia and Oats Peaks. Oats is the longer hike (about 5.5 miles / 9 km) but more rewarding, as it offers views of Valencia against the Pacific, as well as northward and eastward to the Nine Sisters and Cuesta Ridge; the trail also is less steep. A terrific nine-mile (14-km) loop can be made by continuing over the summit to the Coon Creek trail, then crossing back in front of the range along Rattlesnake Flats Trail. Take water! The \\\"Mountain of Gold\\\" also reigns as a popular out-and-back destination for the many road cyclists in the county, but cyclists ride westward early as strong winds pick up through Los Osos Valley in the early afternoon.\\n*Walk or bike to '''Poly Canyon'''. Located on the north east side of the Cal Poly campus. Poly Canyon is a hilly, open, grassy area where many Cal Poly engineering and architecture students have constructed senior projects. The road up can be reached by taking the main road towards the Poly Canyon Village housing complex and taking a right before the road dips down the hill on a smaller road with a gate that quickly turns to dirt/gravel. Public vehicles are not allowed to drive on it, though be alert for university vehicles travelling up and down on occasion and student runners/cyclists.\\n* Kayaks and other outdoor gear can be rented at reasonable prices by students and the public from '''Poly Escapes''' on the Cal Poly campus. Kayaking is possible in many places in the county, but the most exciting place to kayak is between Shell Beach and Pismo Beach where there are sea caves you can explore.

During wet years it boasts spectacular wildflowers in the spring, and Soda Lake is an important wintering area for waterfowl when precipitation is sufficient to flood the seasonal lakebed. The park is also home to Painted Rock, a Native American site that has been adorned with pictographs over thousands of years. Services are extremely limited, with just a small visitor center, two primitive campgrounds, and a handful of marked trails available.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo County is in central, coastal California, halfway between the metropolitan hubs of San Francisco and Los Angeles. The county is known for its fast-growing wine scene, centered on Paso Robles, and, to a lesser extent, its food. With a generally mild climate and a host of outdoor activities, San Luis County makes for a year-round, family-friendly destination. Its central location makes it a popular extended weekend getaway for people from the San Francisco Bay Area and greater Los Angeles area.\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo County's largest city is [[San Luis Obispo]], home to California Polytechnic State University (\\\"Cal Poly\\\"). To the south of San Luis Obispo is the unincorporated community of [[Avila Beach]] and the towns of [[Arroyo Grande]] and Pismo Beach. To the north of San Luis Obispo are [[Morro Bay]] and [[Los Osos]] on the coast, and [[Atascadero]] and [[Paso Robles]] along with the county's fast-growing wine country.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n[[Image:Neptune Pool, Hearst Castle (5569577705).jpg|thumb|300px|Neptune Pool, Hearst Castle]]\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nHighway 101 is the main north-south highway through the county, traversing the inland portions of the county and providing the fastest route for travelers.  Travelers looking for a more scenic route will enjoy the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] (Highway 1), which runs at a slower pace along the coast and offers scenic views out onto the ocean.\\n\\n[[El Camino Real]] (The Royal Road), a historic route connecting all of California's 21 Spanish missions, passes through the county, roughly following Highway 101\\n\\n=== By plane ===\\nThe San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport ({{IATA|SBP}}) operates service to several western hubs.\\n\\n=== By bus ===\\nAmtrak stops in Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, and Grover Beach.  Several Thruway bus routes traverse SLO County as well.\\n\\nFlixbus runs between San Luis Obispo and Los Angeles.\\n\\nGreyhound stops in Santa Maria.  To reach SLO County, take the RTA route 10.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\n[http://www.slorta.org/ San Luis Obispo Regional Transit Authority] provides bus service between cities and is an affordable way to travel, but service is limited at night and on the weekends.\\n\\nTaking Amtrak can be a fun way to travel or sightsee, but check timetables as the trains only run a few times a day.\\n\\n==Go next==\\n\\n{{mapgroup\\n| width=450\\n| height=450\\n| name=Neighboring counties\\n| target=Q49014\\n}}\\n\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Monterey County]]|wikidata=Q108072}} - Located north of San Luis Obispo County, Monterey County is what many people think of when they think of the Central Coast - the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the beautiful 17-Mile Drive, Cannery Row, Pebble Beach golf course, and the rugged beauty of [[Big Sur]]. The northern part of the county contains every manner of amenity for travelers, ranging from chain motels to five star resorts, while the southern portion of the county is remote and accessible mainly by the [[Pacific Coast Highway]] or on foot by hikers.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Kings County]]|wikidata=Q156358}} - Located northeast of San Luis Obispo County, rural Kings County is responsible for billions of dollars of annual agricultural production, much of it from the dairy industry.  Travelers passing through on [[Interstate 5]] may find the area lacking in attractions, although there are a few hotels and other amenities in the county's small towns.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Kern County]]|wikidata=Q108047}} - Bordering San Luis Obispo County to the east, Kern County extends across a number of geographic regions: the western portion is in the [[San Joaquin Valley]], the northeastern portion is in the [[Sierra Nevada]] mountains, and the southeastern part is in the [[Desert (California)|Desert]].  Visitors to the county are most likely to be heading to [[Bakersfield]], one of California's largest cities, or traveling along Interstate 5 past oil fields and agricultural areas.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Ventura County]]|wikidata=Q108127}} - While to some extent it is an extension of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, San Luis Obispo County's neighbor to the southeast is home to rural getaways like the town of [[Ojai]] that share more with the remote Central Coast region than they do with the massive cities to the south.  While the county is heavily populated (with services to match), the Los Padres National Forest dominates the northern part of this county and provides recreational opportunities for those who want to spend time outdoors.\\n* {{mapgroup-item|name=[[Santa Barbara County]]|wikidata=Q108106}} - San Luis Obispo County's southern neighbor is most famous for the town of [[Santa Barbara]] and is sometimes considered the northern boundary of Southern California. While mountains run through the region, the county is well served by a network of highways, making road trips to the many beautiful wineries a popular activity. The Danish town of [[Solvang]] is a popular destination, and rocket launches can sometimes be viewed near Vandenberg Air Force base, America's west coast spaceport.\\n\\n{{geo|35.38|-120.45|zoom=9}}\\n{{IsPartOf|Central Coast (California)}}\\n{{outlineregion}}\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Citation Correctness (DAG)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.877663449425695, "reason": "The actual output correctly identifies Highway 101 as the major highway to San Luis Obispo, aligning with the expected output.

Use the arrows below to navigate to the surrounding sections:\\n\\n{{center|[[At the airport|'''\\u2190 At the airport''']] \\u2022 [[Arriving by plane|'''Arriving by plane \\u2192''']]}}</div>}}\\n[[Image:Lufthansa 737 interior.jpg|thumb|300px|If only all flights had this much room to spread out!]]\\n\\nThis part of Wikivoyage's guide to flying focuses on what may be the most critical part of your journey \\u2013 sitting in a chair for hours, perhaps many hours. While this may seem a tame exploit, the fact that the chair is hurtling through the air at hundreds of miles an hour adds a welcome ''frisson'' to proceedings. So, with that in mind, this article seeks to make your chair-bound experience as safe and comfortable as possible.  This begins as you enter your airplane.\\n\\n==Help the cabin crew==\\n\\nWhile you'll receive especially attentive service in first- and business-class, '''cabin attendants are not waiters'''.  Their duties require many tasks as they try to make you and all others safe and comfortable while boarding.  They ensure that all food and supplies are properly delivered and stowed.  They also scan and help passengers who may be distressed, ill, unable to find seats, find their seats already occupied, are inebriated or misbehaving, or perhaps on the wrong flight.  ''They do all this as they appear to just stand around''.  You can and should help at least in these ways...\\n* ''Use storage near your seat(s) for carry-ons.'' (1) Using space farther forward adds little convenience for you, but can create great inconvenience for others seated forward.  Because you've helped fill storage in their locale, they may have to store bags near or behind you and go against the flow of others boarding to return to be seated.  When disembarking, they again must go \\\"against the flow\\\" to get to their belongings...likely after everyone else has departed.  And (2), if you store ''anything out of sight'' anywhere, it ''can be pilfered in-flight'' (yes, it happens; thieves watch to ensure no one else knows who your carry-ons belong to).\\n* Don't ask crew to put your carry-ons in overhead bins...many folks pack them heavily.  Carefully close any nearby overhead bin once ''completely'' full if you're not already seated.  Crew will often close others once finally and fully filled because you are already seated, and they're masters at (re)packing them for people arriving late.\\n* Put your items in bins or under the seat in front of yours in such a way that they take up the least space possible, e.g. wheeled luggage ''wheels-in'' or ''out'', not sideways if possible (good pieces are designed to fit perfectly in standard overhead bins).\\n* Take your seat promptly after you've stored your carry-ons.\\n* Don't block aisles as others try to reach their seats, nor while in-flight.\\n* Use the call-button ''only'' if you need assistance ''only'' cabin crew can provide.\\n* Take care with food and liquids as you enter and get seated; eat and drink (after airborne at cruise altitude) to avoid unpredictable spills or (embarrassing) bloating/gas.\\n* Make your fastened seat belt visible to crew, e.g., fasten it over any blanket/jacket/coat you use, especially if you plan to sleep while airborne. Otherwise they'll wake you to check it.\\n* Even if the seat belt sign is off, keep your seat belt bucked when you are seated in case of unexpected turbulence. There have been cases of people being seriously injured, or even killed when the aircraft ran into unexpected but exceptionally violent turbulence.\\n* Use the lavatory facilities in your own cabin, and only when the seat belt sign is not illuminated.  \\n* Follow crew instructions promptly and ''immediately.''\\n\\n==Flying with children==\\n{{seealso|Travelling with children#By plane}}\\nChildren can get restless and irritable while flying and in airports. There are strategies you can follow to ensure your children enjoy the trip. \\n* Arrange entertainment.  The best way is to bring a portable media player, books, or anything else they can use to stay occupied with themselves. Be creative. Phones, tablets and handheld consoles also play video these days, and are much easier to carry than a DVD player and DVDs.  Kids don't seem to mind the fact that the screen is 1\\\" square, and the batteries will last far longer than a DVD player for longer flights.\\n* Have something for them to suck on while ascending and descending.  Don't give it to the child when you get onto the plane - wait until you are taxiing to the runway, or it will be finished before you take off.  Similarly, wait until well into the descent.\\n* Bring favorite snacks for fussy eaters.  If children don't like the airplane food and get hungry, irritability can increase.  ''If flying to another country, ensure snacks not consumed won't violate its regulations.''\\n* Aim for a window seat for the child, and sit by the window at the airport.  Airports are a hive of activity, usually enough to keep any child occupied for a little while.\\n* Get an airport book. There are many picture books for young children that name the many things at the airport. For older children at a large airport, an airplane identification chart can pass some time.\\n\\nConsider safety.  If you are traveling with a child who is less than three, have them sit '''on an approved child carrier, not on your lap.''' (Approved or airline carriers may have special seat belts that improve their protection.)  In the unlikely event of an emergency, a lap child may impede your ability to brace.  Be aware of whether there is an oxygen mask for infants on the aircraft/row.\\n\\nAnd generally, anticipate delays.  Even the shortest flights can be delayed, involving additional time both in the terminal and on the aircraft.  Ensure you have sufficient food, clothes, nappies, and entertainment to avoid turning a couple of hours delay into a nightmare.\\nThis will free them to do truly essential flight tasks.\\n\\nSome airlines, rather controversially, do not permit male passengers to be seated next to unaccompanied children. If you are seated next to an unaccompanied child, you may be made to swap seats with a female passenger.\\n\\n==Before take-off==\\n[[File:Flight attendants performing a pre-flight safety demonstration on an Aeroflot Sukhoi Superjet.jpg|thumb|Flight attendants performing a pre-flight safety demonstration on an Aeroflot Sukhoi Superjet]]\\n* Buckle up and strap your children, in safety seats as needed, then yourself.\\n* Count the number of seat backs between your seat and the emergency exits, keeping in mind that your nearest exit may be behind you. If you ever need to evacuate an aircraft in an emergency you may need to do it in a darkened cabin that could be full of thick black smoke. If the aisle is full of people you will at least know the number of seats you need to climb over to get out in that one in a million emergency.\\n* Put your mobile phone and any other transmitting device into flight mode or switch it off. Using a phone while the plane is in the air is a violation of some air travel safety regulations. In some countries, switching the phone off is ''mandatory'' throughout the entire flight. Switching the phones off was intended to prevent electromagnetic interference with automated flight control systems (especially during the landing process), but it has the additional benefit of preserving your phone's battery: Most phones cannot connect with cell phone towers at typical cruising altitudes, and searching for a signal is a battery-draining task. Also, even if your phone were powerful enough to connect to a tower, airplanes can move 10 times faster than cars, so it would have to engage in this battery-draining search for a new cell phone tower up to 30 times each hour.\\n** If you wish to use Bluetooth headphones or the in-flight Wi-Fi service, you still have to place your device in airplane mode before takeoff to block the mobile phone signals. Once you are allowed to use your device in the air, you can individually turn on the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi functions. For tablets and laptops with no mobile phone service, you can turn off the airplane mode altogether.\\n** If you need to make a call while at altitude, your aircraft's telephone carrier partner ''may'' provide in-flight service. This is ''very expensive''. Consult your in-flight magazine, especially for details on charges. Typically these cost about $5/minute (plus connection charges) even if you are directly above the place you are calling. SMS on these in-seat handsets may also be available.\\n* Read the emergency instructions and watch the safety briefing even if you have ridden on the airline before as safety features may vary per aircraft and airline. It may be boring but if an emergency happens you will remember what to do, rather than having to read the safety card then and thereby saving precious time.\\n* Place anything containing items you'll use in-flight under the seat in front of you to eliminate obstructing the aisle, if they are small, in the seat pocket facing you. This will minimize disturbance caused to those sitting in aisle seats. If you later need the leg/foot room, and overhead space is available, you can then move to there what you no longer need.\\n* Keep within sight anything you put in overhead bins that contains valuables. As mentioned previously, thieves operate on flights. As necessary, put valuables under the seat at your feet.\\n* If you are sitting near the windows, you might be requested to raise the window blind. This is to ensure any possible dangers outside can be spotted. The exception is when you are taking off/arriving at an airport with military presence, where the window blind is to be lowered to prevent espionage.\\n* Once seated, and if you have them, use sanitizer/sanitizing wipes to clean your hands, tray table, arm rests and (when convenient) the handles on overhead bins.\\n\\n==During flight==\\n[[File:London2007zurich img 5733.jpg|thumb|Keep your seatbelt fastened when seated]]\\n* In cases of an open flight in economy class when nobody is beside you, feel free to put up the armrests (except in exit rows where the armrests can't be lifted) to claim the extra space to yourself. On wide-body aircraft, you can sometimes get a middle block to yourself and turn this into a flat bed of sorts.   \\n* '''Wear your seat belt at all times while seated.'''  Though it doesn't happen often, more people are injured (a few even killed) by failing to use \\\"belts\\\" than from all other causes of flying injuries.  Severe air turbulence can occur without warning even in clear air, and it can violently throw you and others about.  When the seat belt sign is off, it only indicates that you'll probably be reasonably safe to move about the cabin briefly.\\n* When getting up from other than the aisle seat, first ask seatmates to let you out, and try not to disturb people behind or in front of you.\\n* Avoid getting in the way of the food trolley. If you get up during the food service, you may have to wait for a while before you can get back to your seat. \\n* As a good neighbor, check in advance with the folks behind you if you may/must tilt your seat-back backwards...and just before you do so.  The pitch of many economy seats has gotten so small that tilting seat-backs can greatly intrude into space they really need.\\n* On medium-to-long flights, drink lots of liquids without caffeine or alcohol because the latter will dehydrate you at an even faster pace than the airplane's very low humidity.  That can worsen jet lag and may induce headaches.  Don't hesitate to ask the cabin crew for water, or walk up to the galley to get it. Some airlines (e.g., Emirates, Qantas, Cathay Pacific) offer self-service water fountains (and more) at each galley for passengers to fill their own water bottles. If sanitation is an unknown, ask for bottled water.\\n* '''Don't sit still for the duration of a multi-hour flight'''. Your body isn't designed to stay that way for hours.\\n** Adjust your body position occasionally (you do this in your sleep anyway).  On long flights especially...\\n** Stretch, flex knees, move your feet in circles...anything you can do in your seat. Some airlines now periodically show video programs showing how to exercise in your seat.  Follow them, or do your own thing (or both).  By changing position, and moving around a little, you make sure every part of your body gets the circulation it needs, e.g., to avoid deep vein thrombosis (DVT).   \\n** Consider walking around the aircraft occasionally during long flights.  Feeling self-conscious about just walking around?  Stroll off to the lavatory or galley, or stand up and pretend that you need something out of the overhead bin once an hour.  If you have an aisle seat, stand up every time your neighbors want to move, instead of hoping that they'll squeeze past you.\\n** You might remove your shoes if convenient.  On very long flights, better airlines offer slippers upon request, but you'll likely also need warm socks.  Always wear shoes in the lavatory, where the floor may be wet.\\n* With the exception of some private charters, ''smoking (even electronic cigarettes) is not allowed on any commercial flight worldwide''. Do not smoke at your seat, in the lavatories or tamper with the smoke detectors in the lavatories to avoid being caught \\u2013 at minimum you'll be in trouble with the airline and in some jurisdictions subject to prosecution. In U.S. \\\"flagged\\\" aircraft (and many others), '''federal law prohibits tampering with, disabling, or destroying smoke detectors in aircraft lavatories'''. It's a serious crime, and violation can lead to fines of thousands of dollars, and even a prison sentence. Worried about how you'll survive?  Try nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or other tobacco cessation tools.  Plan for ways to handle anxiety, if that's one of your triggers.  Also, plan other things to do.  The immediate urge to smoke, even when it's strong, will subside while you're busy watching funny cat videos or listening to your favorite music.  You may also take advantage of the long flight as an opportunity to quit smoking.  If you resist lighting up and using other forms of nicotine for 72 hours since your last cigarette, the physical urges will have passed, and you'll be well on your way to staying tobacco-free.\\n* Avoid placing passports and other essentials in the seat pocket, where they can easily be forgotten.\\n* Stow any loose items during times of turbulence and before landing. Put magazines and books in the seat pocket.  Don't leave anything lying on an empty seat or loose under your feet. Under heavy braking on landing, light articles and even things like laptops can slide/roll quite far forward or even become potentially injury-causing projectiles. The smaller items may be difficult to find, and they may be accidentally damaged by exiting passengers, if not by being thrown across the cabin.\\n* '''Always follow the instructions of flight attendants''', as well as lighted and posted signs.  They are there for your safety and for that of all passengers.\\n** Flight attendants are trained to be responsible for your safety. Do not argue with them. Resolve any conflict you may have with their orders later on the ground.\\n** If an \\\"unruly passenger\\\" becomes a serious problem, the captain of the plane may divert to a nearby airport where the passenger will be arrested by local police and escorted off the airplane. Diversions cost the airline a lot of money, and the unruly passenger may be billed for these costs.\\n** Flight attendants are often backed by law, and interfering with or physically assaulting a flight attendant is a serious crime. Short of that, you still can face severe fines and costs for disobeying.\\n* Most airlines (including all US flagged carriers, due to local civil aviation law) prohibit the use of mobile phones in flight, unless placed into \\\"flight safe mode\\\" or \\\"aircraft mode\\\" before departure. A few carriers (e.g. Emirates and Virgin Atlantic on some aircraft types) are now permitting the use of mobile data and even voice calls while airborne. Keep in mind that you'll need an international roaming contract with your carrier and rates tend to be ''very'' high (US$1-$3 per minute or $10+ per gigabyte is fairly standard.), so be careful with your usage. If voice calls are permitted, be courteous to your fellow passengers and keep conversations brief. Fortunately, many airlines also offer free Wi-Fi onboard.\\n* Other electronic devices are usually permitted once the aircraft is at cruise and the seat belt sign is switched off. Rules regarding when and which devices can be used vary by country and airline:\\n** In Australia and the United States, airlines typically list categories of devices that ''cannot'' be used on the safety card (TVs, remote controlled toys, etc...) in their magazines.\\n** In Canada, however, aviation law requires a more precautionary approach. No electronic devices are permitted unless a crew member individually checks and authorizes their use. \\n*** Laptops are the only devices that are explicitly stated in safety briefings as being allowed \\u2013 as long as you check with a flight attendant and any mobile data capabilities are disabled before use. In the past, Air Canada used to state that the use of external laptop accessories (such as hard drives, mice, printers, etc...) was prohibited. The current safety video doesn't mention this, but always check first.\\n*** Other devices such as tablets, iPods, and game systems are at the crew's discretion but are almost always permitted if you ask.\\n* If you are travelling internationally, the flight attendants will give information about any immigration and customs prodedures at your destination.\\n\\n==Sleeping==\\n\\nA short flight can be scheduled during the day, but for intercontinental flights you may have no choice but to fly overnight. Some preparations can help you get a little shut-eye.\\n\\nFlying '''first class or business class''' helps a lot (but is much more expensive than economy), with seats that recline further (sometimes even to a flat bed) and maybe a little care package with a sleep mask, toiletries, etc. Even for economy passengers, airlines often provide a pillow and blanket, especially for long-haul flights.\\n\\nBring an '''eye mask''', and consider earplugs, a pillow (some flyers love neck pillows; others find them uncomfortable), blanket, and relaxing music or an audiobook.\\n\\n'''Avoid alcohol''', which can disrupt your sleep, and '''sleeping pills''', which can cause weird or embarrassing behavior if the less-than-restful atmosphere of the airplane stops you from getting to sleep. If you're on a long overnight flight and you really need something to help you fall asleep, try taking '''melatonin''' instead. If you take it in pill form, it takes 90 minutes to be effective; in sublingual form it's effective in less than a half hour. But if you're woken up too soon, melatonin may make you feel groggy. Mayo Clinic Dr. Lois Krahn recommends 3 milligrams of the short-acting version.\\n\\nEven if you prepare, accept that '''you're unlikely to really get a good night's sleep'''. Most airline seats are uncomfortable and hard to stretch out in, and on most flights there will be noise, activity, and lights turning on and waking you up. A better strategy may be to plan accordingly. Give yourself time to recover when you arrive\\u2014which may be necessary anyway due to [[jetlag]]. To make yourself alert when you land, have a cup of tea or coffee, which the flight attendants will probably offer you when you're getting close to landing.\\n\\n==Eating and drinking on board==\\n[[File:A Meal In Planes Of British Airways.jpg|thumb|A larger in-flight meal]]\\n[[File:Delta Air Lines Meal.jpg|thumb|A smaller in-flight snack]]\\nThe range, price and quality of airline food varies a lot between airlines.\\n\\nWhile meals, as well as generous servings of [[alcoholic beverages]], used to be included with the ticket in the \\\"good old days\\\", passengers are usually required to pay for food; except in [[flying business class|first and business class]], long intercontinental flights, and flights of over an hour in length on full-service carriers within Asia and Australia. Scheduled meals (if any) will often be timed and typed to complement the time zone of the flight's destination. If you pass many time zones, early servings may not match your departure time.  \\n\\nFor flights that promise no [[food]] during meal hours, consider bringing food with you or buying something at the airport; most airlines will allow you to carry it on board, though budget airlines are often an exception to this.  Containers of \\\"solid\\\" food from home or a favorite restaurant can usually be run through the same security procedures as any other item of carry-on luggage, but you'll need to buy drinks and other liquids or semi-liquid foods (including peanut butter, jelly, or yogurt) inside the secure area.  The food selection at some airports may be poor and/or overpriced.  The crew would prefer that you didn't bring drippy or messy foods, and your fellow passengers would prefer that you didn't bring smelly foods, so leave the tray of barbecue chicken wings or that awesome curry on the ground.  Especially if you or a travel companion have diabetes or similar health issues, always bring an \\\"emergency\\\" snack.  A small bag of nuts, an apple, or a granola bar can be handy if your flight is delayed.  If you are crossing international boundaries, or going between states in Australia, choose a snack that can be imported to your destination legally (e.g., baked goods), or make sure to either eat it or discard it before getting off the airplane (e.g., fresh fruit).\\n\\nOn-board meals for some airlines may be brought in from one of its base or hub airports rather than from a local source. This takes considerable time.  Meals kept at serving temperatures too long, for any reason, may have to be discarded to prevent food poisoning.  Scheduled meals may then be limited to packaged snacks/cookies and drinks.  This is not the fault of the crew.  If an airline ''only'' offers \\\"buy on board\\\" food, prices may well be outrageous to take advantage of a captive market, but the airline will likely make sure that something is available in order to improve their bottom line, as they can't make money on food not sold.\\n\\nTap water on the plane may be unsanitary, so it is a good idea to ask where the water is coming from. The tea and coffee served aboard, as well as the ice cubes, may be made from the same tap water and thus possibly unsafe, and even then the taste may be negatively affected. Most non-budget airlines provide a range of non-alcoholic beverages to choose from, especially on longer flights, often for free.\\n\\nThe low-pressure and low-humidity environment on the aircraft alters how food tastes, particularly making them less sweet compared to food on the ground. To counteract this, airlines tend to over-season food, adding unnecessary calories. On the other hand, savory (umami) flavor is stronger at altitude, which makes tomato juice, as well as some meats and cheeses, tastier than they would be on land. Newer aircraft models have technologies that allow for higher humidity and pressure, lessening the impacts on taste.\\n\\nSpecial meals such as [[Kashrut|kosher]], [[Islam#Eat|halal]], [[Hinduism#Eat|Hindu]] and [[Travel as a vegetarian|vegetarian]] food are available from most major airlines, but typically must be requested at least several days in advance. For some additional information, see [[Travel as a vegetarian#Air travel]].  Some airlines provide special meals for children, sometimes including jars of baby food. These also must be requested in advance.\\n\\nExpect no service in [[general aviation]], except in business jets.\\n\\n==Buy==\\nDuring the flight, most major airlines, with the exception of US-based airlines, also provide inflight duty free shopping for international flights. Items on sale are rarely top-end luxury items, and are rarely bargains price-wise, though they typically include travel accessories and some airline-exclusive products.\\n\\n==Toilets==\\n[[File:Aircraft Lavatory.JPG|thumb|An aircraft toilet]]\\nAirliner toilets are infamously small, and the line might be long. On short flights, using the airport toilet before or after the flight is usually a more comfortable option. On some flights, most notably flights to and from the United States, forming a line at the front (near the cockpit) may be prohibited because of security concerns. If so, look at the lit-up bathroom sign and wait for an opportunity when it isn't already occupied.\\n\\n==Health==\\n{{seealso|Flying and health}}\\n===Pressure changes===\\nAir pressure is much lower at high altitude, and while a commercial aircraft cabin holds much of the pressure, in-flight cabin pressure is still significantly lower than at sea level.\\n\\nAir pressure can cause discomfort in the inner ear, especially for passengers with nasal congestion. This most often occurs during descent, and can be quickly remedied by closing mouth, pinching nostrils and trying to exhale, perhaps several times until landing.\\n\\n===Deep vein thrombosis===\\n{{cautionbox|The following discussion should not be taken as medical advice. Consult a doctor if you think you might have or be at risk for DVT during planned travel.}}\\nPassengers on long flights may be prone to deep vein thrombosis (DVT); blood clots forming in the veins. The elderly tend to have greater risk than the young. Early symptoms are pain or swelling in the legs. Some precautions are to stretch and/or walk at least every 2 hours or so, doing in-seat exercises, and drinking water, or other non-alcoholic, caffeine-free beverages. High-risk patients could choose an aisle-seat, use compression-hose socks, and prescription blood thinners or over-the-counter aspirin with physician approval.\\n\\nSee a more comprehensive article at [[w:Deep vein thrombosis]].\\n\\n==Landing==\\nLanding might be delayed because of traffic or weather conditions. Applauding the pilot at touchdown is a custom that can be frowned upon in some countries like the United States, but is an etiquette in other countries like [[Russia]].\\n\\nRemain seated and buckled up until the plane has taxied all the way to the gate. Do not smoke until you have fully passed the terminal building or reached a designated smoking room.\\n\\n{{flyingtopics}}\\n\\n{{ombox|type=custom|image=[[File:BSicon FLUG.svg|link=Flying|30px]]|text=<span style=\\\"color:black\\\"> Done?

It links the region with [[Vancouver]] in the south and [[Lillooet]] and Highways 97 and 1 in the north. It is a beautiful but windy and, at times narrow, road. The highway was significantly upgraded and widened prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics and is now much safer compared to the past, when it had a slightly dangerous reputation, but care should still be taken when driving, especially in winter conditions. The section along Howe Sound between Vancouver and Whistler via Squamish is probably one of the most scenic routes to be found anywhere. Typical driving time from Vancouver to Whistler is 2-2\\u00bd hours. Winter tires are required on the Sea to Sky Highway from October 1 to March 31.\\n\\nThere are a number of rideshare sites available [https://www.poparide.com/] where you can find people to share the drive or find a ride for $0-20.

There are bus and limousine companies that provide direct shuttle service from the airport to [[Squamish]] and [[Whistler]], see \\\"By bus\\\" above. Car rental is also available at the airport (in winter, always request snow tires and inspect to confirm they were installed).\\n\\nVisitors arriving from the United States may find flying domestically to [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]] or [[Bellingham (Washington)#By plane|Bellingham International Airport]] and taking bus services across the border to be a cheaper option. The bus journey will be upwards of 5 hours. '''[https://quickcoach.com/ Quick Shuttle]''' offers bus services to those airports from Vancouver.\\n\\nWhistler and Pemberton both have small air facilities that handle a few regional chartered flights.\\n\\n=== By train ===\\n\\n* '''Lillooet - Shalalth - Seton Portage''' The 2 car passenger train provides, besides daily round trip service, limited service farther south to Ponderosa Ranch near D'Arcy & can be chartered to extend the Ponderosa Run to D'Arcy - 45 min North of Pemberton - at the head of Anderson Lake. Expect occasional minor delays by Mountain Goats &/or Big Horn Sheep. They scatter at sight of the '''CN''' freight trains on the '''BCR''' Line but show no fear of the 2 car self-propelled passenger cars.  See \\n* The '''[[Rocky Mountaineer]]''' stops at Whistler on the ''Rainforest to Gold Rush'' route from Vancouver to Jasper via Whistler and [[Quesnel]].\\n\\n==Get around==\\nAccess to some provincial parks and recreation areas is by Forest Service Roads (FSRs). Care should be taken when driving on these roads as some of them are in rough condition (possibly 4x4 or All Wheel Drive only) and they may still be actively used by logging trucks.  Many such roads are \\\"radio-controlled\\\" so having a CB Radio will help avoid serious accidents.\\n\\nConstruction is under way to build the Sea to Sky Trail, a multi-use trail that will connect Pemberton to Squamish and make it easier to bike through the region. The trail will be gravel in parts however, so it is suitable for mountain bikes rather than road bikes.\\n\\n=== By public transit ===\\n[https://www.bctransit.com/ BC Transit] operates bus services in [[Squamish]], [[Pemberton (British Columbia)|Pemberton]], and [[Whistler]], all which operate throughout the day.  Bus service within Whistler is frequent.  Bus service is available between Pemberton and Whistler, but otherwise is not available between cities.\\n\\n==See==\\n[[File:Trips 04 - Joffre Group - 02 (90976273).jpg|thumb|275px|Lower Joffre Lake in [[Joffre Lakes Provincial Park]]]]\\nThe region's biggest attraction is '''the scenery''' \\u2014 exquisite alpine lakes, craggy peaks, waterfalls, glaciers \\u2014 and a surprising amount of it is easily accessible from the Sea to Sky Highway. Highlights include:\\n* '''Shannon Falls''' drop 335 meters, making them the third tallest waterfall in the province. They are just south of [[Squamish]] and it is about a 10-minute walk from the parking lot to a viewpoint at the bottom of the falls.\\n* '''Brandywine Falls''' are located south of [[Whistler]]. It is about a 10-minute walk from the parking lot to a lookout above the spectacular falls.\\n* '''Nairn Falls''' are in [[Pemberton (British Columbia)|Pemberton]]. The falls are 60 m high and accessed by a 10-20 minute walk from the parking lot.\\n* '''Lower Joffre Lake,''' in [[Joffre Lakes Provincial Park]], is a beautiful turquoise alpine lake set against the backdrop of the Matier Glacier. It's northeast of Pemberton and is accessed by a five-minute walk from the parking lot. If you're looking for a more serious hike, continue on the trail to the Middle and Upper Joffre Lakes (it's 5.5 km) for more stunning views.\\n* '''Garibaldi Lake''', in [[Garibaldi Provincial Park]], requires a 20 km round trip hike to see, but it's spectacular.\\n\\nIf you're keen to learn about the region's history, a couple of museums are worth checking. The BC Museum of Mining in [[Lions Bay-Britannia Beach|Britannia Beach]] is the site of an old copper mine and now has a number of exhibits and activities.  In [[Whistler]], he Squamish Lil'wat Cultural Centre showcases the art, history and culture of the Squamish and Lil'wat First Nations, while the Audain Art Museum has an excellent collection of art by British Columbia artists, and visiting exhibitions.\\n\\n==Do==\\n[[File:Beautiful clouds in Whistler (45866925295).jpg|right|thumb|Skiing at [[Whistler]]]]\\nIf you want to do something outdoors, the Sea to Sky region is your place to be. [[Whistler]] is home to the biggest '''ski resort''' in North America \\u2014 Whistler-Blackcomb \\u2014 with a season that lasts from Nov to May and glacier skiing in the summer. Starting in May (most years), Whistler mountain is converted into a mountain bike park where the lifts are used to transport riders and bikes up so they can get the full experience of biking down a mountain with a few jumps and obstacles along the way. Mountain bike trails (without the lifts) also exist throughout much of the region.\\n\\n'''Hiking''' is very popular and there are a range of trails from short fairly flat routes (Shannon Falls in [[Squamish]], Brandywine Falls near Whistler, Lower Joffre Lake outside of [[Pemberton (British Columbia)|Pemberton]]) to rigorous climbs up mountains (The Lions in [[Lions Bay-Britannia Beach|Lions Bay]] and Wedge Mountain in [[Garibaldi Provincial Park]]) to the multiday options of Garibaldi Provincial Park. Some of the most rewarding hikes are The Stawamus Chief (Squamish), Garibaldi Lake (Garibaldi Provincial Park) and Upper Joffre Lake (Pemberton). The best book for information about hiking in this area (and all of the Lower Mainland) is '''103 Hikes of Southwestern  British Columbia'''  {{ISBN|1550547755}}.\\n\\nSquamish is renowned for '''rock climbing''' and has a number of routes and bouldering options in the town and nearby. Other adrenaline inducing activities include white water kayaking and rafting on the rivers between Squamish and Whistler, bungee jumping in Whistler and kiteboarding in Squamish. There's also an artificial reef for scuba diving in [[Lions Bay-Britannia Beach|Porteau Cove]].\\n\\nOn the less strenuous side, '''golf''' is popular with a number of courses throughout the region. Whistler has the largest number and most celebrated, with courses designed by Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Robert Trent Jones Jr. There is also a course just north of Porteau Cove and two clubs in each of Squamish and Pemberton.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nYou won't go hungry when visiting the Sea to Sky region, but the number of restaurants and the range of choice depends on where you are. [[Whistler]] has the widest array of restaurants and food options consistent with its status as a major resort. [[Squamish|Squamish's]] dining scene is lower profile but it does have a number of good caf\\u00e9-style restaurants. It also has the largest number of fast food restaurants if you want or need something in a hurry.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n[[File:Whistler, 8 juin 2008, 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Whistler]] village]]\\nSuiting its young population and streams of visitors, Whistler has a large mix of bars, clubs and DJs to dance, drink or socialize the night away. During busy periods, expect line-ups at the popular spots but you may get a chance to party with a celebrity. At least one or two bars in town will usually have live music. A good source of information for current events and entertainment info' are the local papers: ''The Pique'' and ''The Question'' give Whistler and Pemberton Listings, and the ''Chief'' for Squamish.\\n\\nSquamish and Pemberton both have local bars and pubs. The scene is lower key than Whistler, with more character and less flash.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\nThe Sea to Sky region has a full range of accommodation options. The higher end hotels and apartment/condo rentals are mostly in Whistler, with some cheaper options in Squamish and Pemberton. There are B&Bs in all three towns, but hostels are surprisingly under represented, with just a handful in Whistler.\\n\\nCamping is available in the provincial parks and recreation sites scattered throughout the region. For summer weekend, it's recommended to book in advance, early in the new year, as they sell out. Many of the sites are drive-in (Nairn Falls and Birkenhead Lake) although there are some spectacular campsites if you're willing to hike for a bit at parks like Garibaldi and Joffre Lakes.\\n\\nThere are also many free, unmaintained forestry campsites, such as along Lillooet Lake and River. Be warned you could have your tranquility broken by loud yahoos. No matter how wild the party the cops won't come unless they are burning down the forest. Recommend these sites only in off season, while school is still in session.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nWeather can change quickly due to the rapid changes to elevation.\\n\\nDespite the upgrades to Highway 99, some sections remain steep and windy. They are often marked by lower maximum speed limits.\\n\\n==Go next==\\n* '''[[Fraser Canyon and Bridge River Country|Lillooet Country]]''' to the north is the gateway to the Cariboo. The [[Bridge River Valley]] has more camping, fishing and hiking.\\n* '''[[Sunshine Coast (British Columbia)|Sunshine Coast]]''' - more laid back small towns and vacation areas\\n\\n{{IsPartOf|Lower Mainland}}\\n{{usableregion}}\\n\\n\\n\\n{{geo|49.9361|-123.1667|zoom=10}}\", \"{{pagebanner|WV banner Clothing sizes Shoe sizes.jpg}}\\nMany voyagers like to [[shopping|shop]] for [[clothes]] abroad. Some types of clothes might be significantly cheaper in another country, and often you can find things that you're unable to find in your home country.\\n\\nWhen buying clothes abroad (or from a foreign online store) you may however run into a number of different systems for '''clothing sizes'''. In some stores (let alone in open-air markets and similar places) there are not facilities available for trying clothes, so having a reference of the local size system at hand can be useful. \\n\\nIn some cases clothes are marked by letters like S(mall), M(edium), L(arge), XL (extra large) and so on \\u2014 souvenir t-shirts are often marked this way. However these do in practice vary \\u2014 for example clothes of a certain size sold on the [[Asia]]n market are often a bit smaller than [[USA|American]] equivalents. Finally, clothing markings may be faulty or entirely missing.\\n\\n== Women ==\\n\\n===Comparison tables===\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\"\\n|+ Women's dresses and suits \\n!

Click for larger view.]]\\n\\n'''Time zones and daylight hours''' affect travellers in many ways. Watches and smartphones may show a time different from the local one, friends may call in the middle of the night as it is afternoon at home, and the sun may rise at wall clock times you wouldn't expect. The official local time affects opening hours, but for outdoor activities you may need to also consider when it is morning or noon according to the sun. This article discusses most of those issues. Below is also a list of countries, regions, and territories grouped by time zone. For extreme sunrise and sunset times, occurring in the far north and south, see also [[Midnight sun]].\\n\\n==Understand==\\n{{seealso|Timepieces}}\\n{{quote|Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore<br />So do our minutes hasten to their end|author=William Shakespeare, Sonnet 60}}\\n\\nAlthough many time zones have descriptive names used by people in them, they are least ambiguously identified by their relationship to '''UTC''' (Universal Time, Co-ordinated). '''GMT''' (Greenwich Mean Time) is nearly synonymous, named after the Royal Observatory located in the [[London/Greenwich|Greenwich]] area of London, but its definitions have varied over time and may vary slightly by context. UT, UT0, UT1 and UT2 are other nearly synonymous standards.\\n\\nUTC is also sometimes called '''Z''' or '''Zulu''' time. A time may be written as e.g. 21:45Z with the Z indicating UTC. The \\\"Z\\\" is for \\\"zero\\\", and \\\"Zulu\\\" is the two-way radio pronunciation of \\\"Z\\\". It comes from the nautical system in which each time zone was assigned a letter.\\n\\nTime zones east of UTC and west of the International Date Line are specified by the number of hours ''ahead'' of UTC (e.g. UTC+4); zones west of UTC and east of the Date Line are specified by the number of hours ''behind'' UTC (e.g. UTC-6). Crossing the Date Line going eastward, clocks are turned back a full 24 hours, and vice versa in the opposite direction. The total span of time zones covers more than 24 hours because the Date Line jogs westward and eastward to keep certain national island groups on the same calendar day, although they are not within a single time zone.\\n[[File:Solar_time_vs_standard_time.png|thumb|Map showing the difference between clock time and solar time (ignoring DST)]]\\nWhile when observing \\\"sun time\\\", the sun is at its highest at noon, the political time zones can be stretched out or biased to differ even a few hours from this. Often the only thing that matters is wall clock time, but in areas where you'd prefer indoor activities in the hottest hours, or where daylight hours are few, check times of the hottest hours, the hours with most UV-radiation, or times of sunrise and sunset, depending on your needs. If you don't have these times available, note that the sun moves 15\\u00b0 of longitude by hour, so 30\\u00b0 east of Greenwich, the sun is at its highest at 10:00 UTC; if the time zone is UTC+1, that's 11:00. The hottest time is usually the hours after noon. Darkness comes soon after sunset near the equator, while real dusk comes half an hour after sunset at latitudes of 60\\u00b0.\\n\\nSunrise and sunset can occur at vastly different times than you might be used to, varying from east to west across each time zone. As such, it might be a good idea to check sunrise and sunset times for the time of year you'll be travelling to your destination. As an example: in the American Eastern Time Zone, [[Boston]] and parts of Maine and New England, see daybreak around 4:45\\u20135:45AM in the summer and sunset by 8PM, but in the western edge, [[Indiana]] Michigan, sunrise isn't until 6:30AM and it isn't dark til 9:15\\u201310:15PM. Another example is [[Vorkuta]] in Russia, where sunrise and sunset annually average out at 4:40AM and 4:40PM \\u2013 with \\\"yesterday\\\" sunrises in May and July. In western [[Spain]], [[China]], and [[Alaska]], daylight averages from 8:30AM to 8:30PM.\\n\\n==Travel across time zones==\\nYou need to take some care when planning trips that cross several time zones, e.g.,\\n*  Your \\\"body clock\\\" may experience some stress as you tell it to meet business appointments, tours and other obligations during hours when you'd be asleep if at home. See [[Jet lag]].\\n*  You may miss an important obligation, or connections with scheduled transport, simply by not understanding what will be the correct local time \\u2013 or a different time used in your timetable \\u2013 as you travel.\\n*  Crossing the International Date Line can cause confusion about on what date you'll arrive:\\n**  Starting a 12\\u201315 hour flight from the U.S. west coast to Japan or Hong Kong in late evening can land you there in the morning '''two''' calendar days later.\\n**  If starting the reverse course by midday, you may, in a way, travel back in time, as you land earlier than you started. For example a typical flight from [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]] to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LA]] will take off at lunchtime and land early in the morning on the same calendar date!\\n* Even just crossing from one time zone to another can be confusing, as you still may arrive before you left, such as when flying from [[Minsk]] to [[Warsaw]]. You don't even need to fly, or travel east to west. The same happens when taking the north-bound bus from [[Utsjoki]] to [[Tana]]. Crossing from [[Kirkenes]] south to [[Murmansk Oblast]] (from November to March), you instead lose two hours, in addition to the travel time.\\n\\nIf your travel has time zone complexities or possible impacts on your health or comfort, consult an expert as you plan it.\\n\\nIf you're in another part of the world, family and friends should be aware of the time zone issue when contacting you. You don't want them calling you in the middle of your night, even if it for them is the time they are used to calling.\\n\\n==Jet lag==\\n{{Main|Jet lag}}\\n\\n'''Jet lag''' is a mismatch between your body clock and the local time wherever you are. It's caused by rapid travel across time zones, and compounded by the fact that long hours spent on a plane can cause you to sleep too much, or not enough, possibly at the wrong time. Flights from east to west, where you gain a few hours, are usually a bit easier, as most people find it easier to stay up a little later than to go to bed earlier. A rule of thumb is that you recover about 1 hour difference per day. You may find that on your way out, you are fine after just a couple of days, but you will really notice the recovery period '''on your way home'''. At that point your body clock will be ''really'' confused and it will take a while for it to sort things out.\\n\\nYou can aid the process a bit by trying to operate on your new local time as early as possible, and spending the daylight hours in your new time zone outdoors the first few days. If you're going to land early in the day, try to sleep on the plane so you arrive refreshed and ready for a full day of activity. Conversely, if you're going to arrive near the evening, try to stay awake on the plane so that you'll be tired when you arrive and can get a lengthy sleep.\\n\\n==Political time zones==\\nAs can be seen on the map above, some time-zones seem to defy logic and were mostly drawn by national or regional governments to make commerce and administration easier. This can have strange consequences, most notably in the case of [[China]] which \\\"should\\\" span five time zones but for political reasons observes the same (Beijing) time in all its territory. To complicate matters, in the restive province of [[Xinjiang]], Beijing time is used by ethnic Han, but UTC +6 is used by ethnic Uyghurs. Departure times of long distance transport are given in one time zone (usually that of the departure point, although the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] used to run on Moscow time throughout Russia). On international waters, ship time is decided by the captain (to avoid unnecessary hassle); some [[Baltic ferries]] claim to use local time, while what they use is ship time, which corresponds to time at the departure port (with some confusion at arrival). Sir Sandford Fleming, inventor of time zones, was a railway man as rail travel was the advance that made standard time zones necessary. Some railways published schedules with disclaimers like \\\"all times are X time\\\" even before time zones legally existed. Stations sometimes had a clock showing railway time while the town hall or church showed a different \\\"local time\\\" a few minutes off \\u2013 some stations in Central Europe had a row of clocks for different lines.\\n\\nThe time zones (and the International Date Line) often snake around political boundaries; [[Chicago]] lags a full hour behind [[Thunder Bay]] because the latter is on [[Ottawa]]'s side of a provincial boundary. There's a 21-hour time difference between the [[Diomede Islands]], a mere {{km|3}} apart but separated by the International Date Line. Visiting the Aroostook Valley Country Club? By the time you get to the 19th hole, you may be wondering where that extra hour went... as the clubhouse was built in [[New Brunswick]] as a measure to circumvent Prohibition, putting it an hour ahead of the same course's pro shop in [[Maine]].\\n\\nAnother odd time-zone border lies in Europe where (also mostly due to political reasons) going west from [[France]] lets you stay in the same time zone \\u2013 when you ''should'' have to change from Central European time (UTC+1) to UTC or even UTC-1 \\u2013 but going north from France to [[Great Britain]] you will have to change time-zone to GMT (UTC).\\n\\nA bunch of odd time zones also exist in [[Australia]] where the central states and territories of [[South Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]] are meant to follow UTC+9, but instead, they follow UTC+9.5 to minimise the difference and disruption when going to the eastern states. Unusually, the outback New South Welsh city of Broken Hill, is completely situated in New South Wales, 30km away from the SA border, follows ACST, and not AEST. And worst of all, there are small towns scattered across the middle of nowhere in WA close to the NT border. The problem here is, that some choose to follow AWST (UTC+8) or ACST (UTC+9.5). There's no discrete border between these time zones, and as such, you could be turning your watches back and forth by 1.5 hours frequently in these areas. And finally, in the Gold Coast-Tweed Heads (Qld-NSW), during summer, you may unexpectedly cross the border, you might have travelled an hour ahead or behind. Daylight Saving Time can further complicate matters. \\n\\nA handful of time zones differ from UTC not by full hours but by (usually) some other multiple of 15 minutes. [[North Korea]] adopted UTC+8:30 briefly (which differs from [[South Korea]]'s UTC+9 by half an hour) only to drop it just as abruptly during a 2018 thaw in relations; both moves were deemed political by some. [[Newfoundland]] island (UTC-3.5, summer UTC-2.5) differs from its neighbours [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]] (UTC-3 year-round), [[Cape Breton]] (UTC-4, summer UTC-3) and [[Blanc Sablon]] (UTC-4 year-round); continue into [[Labrador]] and Newfoundland time returns, only to fall back to Cape Breton's time zone somewhere between Red Bay and [[Cartwright (Labrador)|Cartwright]].\\n\\n===Daylight Saving Time===\\nIn many jurisdictions, local time is set forward by an extra hour in summer to \\\"shift\\\" daylight hours to the end of the day. This is known in the UK as British Summer Time (BST, GMT+1) and almost anywhere else as Daylight Saving Time (DST) or with \\\"Daylight Time\\\" appended to the name of the local time zone.\\n\\nBorn as a wartime energy conservation measure, the adoption of DST is inherently political and its abolition (as proposed by the [[European Union]] for the near future) just as political. Most tropical countries see absolutely no need for DST, keeping standard time year round. Southern Hemisphere countries have opposite summer and winter to the Northern Hemisphere. There is no universally agreed point of the year to change from standard to daylight saving time, leaving wild leaps and fluctuations where one country has already changed and the other has not. Sometimes, one subnational jurisdiction (like [[Saskatchewan]] or [[Arizona]]) politically chooses to not use DST at all; tee off at the 9th hole of the Gateway Cities Golf Course in North Portal, Saskatchewan and the ball rolls into the cup in Portal, [[North Dakota]] an hour later. Sometimes, one country makes a political decision to start daylight saving time early during a conflict or an energy crisis; the US did this during the 1973-74 oil embargo, leaving the [[Thousand Islands]] briefly in two different time zones and disrupting TV/radio broadcast schedules. If you travel during that time or call home, inform yourself of the local time at both your destination and point of origin.\\n\\nIn temperate northern countries, DST usually starts late March or early April and ends late October or early November; exact start dates (and times) vary by country (but are harmonized across [[European Union|EU]]). Equatorial nations typically use no DST; southern nations will use dates that match their local summer. It's not unheard of for an individual subnational jurisdiction \\u2013 or even a piece of one province \\u2013 to opt out of a DST scheme in effect in the rest of the same nation. Due to the nature of daylight saving time the difference in time zones may vary during the year as one country doesn't have daylight saving time while the other does, or both have it but start at different times. However due to increasing commerce and international communication via the internet and other nearly instantaneous modes, there are increasing efforts to harmonize those things, especially among direct neighbors or political entities with good relations with each other.\\n\\n==Sports and time zones==\\nSports fans notice the impact of being in a different time zone any time they plan to view or listen to a live broadcast of a sporting event. For example, someone from the East Coast of the United States who is on the country's West Coast would watch a game three hours earlier per local time than they would while at home. By contrast, Super Bowl Sunday is actually Monday afternoon in Australia.\\n\\nGlobal sporting organizations tend to schedule events according to when they would be viewed live in the U.S.A. and Europe. This happened with the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, when the swimming finals took place in the early morning.\\n\\n==List of time zones==\\n\\n===UTC+14===\\n* [[Kiribati#Line Islands|Kiribati Line Islands]]\\n\\n===UTC+13===\\n[[File:Stratford clock tower.jpg|thumbnail|13:48, Stratford, New Zealand]]\\n* [[Kiribati]]: Phoenix Islands\\n* [[Tokelau]]\\n* [[Samoa]]\\n* [[Tonga]]\\n\\n===UTC+12:45===\\n* [[New Zealand]]: [[Chatham Islands]]\\n\\n===UTC+12===\\n* [[Fiji]]\\n* [[France]]: [[Wallis and Futuna]]\\n* [[Kiribati]]: Gilbert Islands\\n* [[Marshall Islands]]\\n* [[Nauru]]\\n* [[New Zealand]]\\n* [[Russia]]: MSK+9 \\u2014 [[Anadyr]], [[Chukotka]], [[Kamchatka]], [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]], [[Yuzhno-Kurilsk]]\\n* [[South Pole]]\\n* [[Tuvalu]]\\n* [[Wake Island]]\\n\\n===UTC+11===\\n[[File:Central Station Sydney seen from Pitt St.JPG|thumb|15:15, Sydney Central station]]\\n\\n* [[Australia]]: [[Norfolk Island]]\\n* [[Federated States of Micronesia]]: [[Kosrae]], [[Pohnpei]] \\n* [[New Caledonia]]\\n* [[Papua New Guinea]]\\n* [[Russia]]: MSK+8 \\u2014 [[Chersky]], [[Khonuu]], [[Kuril Islands]], [[Magadan Oblast]], [[Srednekolymsk]], [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]], [[Zyryanka]]\\n* [[Solomon Islands]]\\n* [[Vanuatu]]\\n* [[Australia]]: NSW, Vic, ACT and Tasmania (DST)\\n\\n===UTC+10:30===\\n* [[Australia]]: [[Lord Howe Island]]\\n\\n===UTC+10===\\n* [[Australia]]: [[Australian Capital Territory]], almost all of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]] (''Australian Eastern Standard Time'')\\n* [[Federated States of Micronesia]]: [[Chuuk]], [[Yap]]\\n* [[Guam]]\\n* [[Northern Mariana Islands]]\\n* [[Papua New Guinea]]\\n* [[Russia]]: MSK+7 \\u2014 [[Birobidzhan]], [[Khabarovsk Krai]], [[Vladivostok]]\\n\\n===UTC+09:30===\\n* [[Australia]]: [[Northern Territory]], [[South Australia]], [[Broken Hill|Broken Hill (New South Wales)]], Blackstone, Irrunytju, Warakurna, Wanarn, Kiwirrkurra, and Tjukurla (''Australian Central Standard Time'')\\n\\n===UTC+09===\\n[[File:Wako Ginza Chuo Tokyo 2 16 November 2003.jpg|thumbnail|13:53, Tokyo, Japan]]\\n\\n* [[Indonesia]] (eastern): [[Maluku]], [[Papua]]\\n* [[Japan]]\\n* [[Palau]]\\n* [[Russia]]: MSK+6 \\u2014 [[Blagoveshchensk]], [[Chita]], [[Yakutia]]\\n* [[South Korea]]\\n* [[Timor-Leste]]\\n* [[North Korea]]\\n\\n===UTC+08:45===\\n* [[Australia]]: [[Eucla]], [[Cocklebiddy]], [[Madura (Western Australia)|Madura]], [[Mundrabilla]] and [[Border Village]] (''Also known as Australian Central Western Standard Time'')\\n\\n===UTC+08===\\n[[File:Sultan Abdul Samad Building clock at night, 10 Aug 2013.JPG|thumbnail|23:25, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]]\\n\\n* [[Australia]]: [[Western Australia]] (''Australian Western Standard Time'')\\n* [[Brunei]]\\n* [[China]]: While China should geographically be in several time zones the Central Government has declared Beijing time to be official in all of China even as far west as Tibet.

A major port on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain, Barcelona has a wide variety of attractions that bring in tourists from around the globe. The many faces of Barcelona include the medieval Old Town, and the unique street grid resulting from 19th-century urban planning. The city has long sandy beaches and green parks on the hills, pretty much side-by-side. It is also famous for a number of prominent buildings, of which the most-known are by the architect Antoni Gaud\\u00ed, including his ''Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia'', which became Barcelona's symbol to many.\\n\\nFounded more than 2,000 years ago as the [[Roman empire|ancient Roman]] town ''Barcino'', Barcelona is as historic as it is modern, with a constant flow of projects changing the face of the city and long-standing penchant for design and innovation. Thanks to the wealth of attractions, a very well-developed accommodation base, a lively nightlife and a robust transportation system, Barcelona has become one of Europe's, and pretty much the world's, most popular tourist destinations.\\n\\n==Districts==\\n\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500|show=mask,go}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q941385|fill=#bdbd7b|title=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q64124|fill=#8888dc|title=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q852697|fill=#75bb75|title=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q753075|fill=#aa6baa|title=[[Barcelona/Sants-Montju\\u00efc|Sants-Montju\\u00efc]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q250935|fill=#67b7b7|title=[[Barcelona/Sant Mart\\u00ed|Sant Mart\\u00ed]]}}\\n{{Mapshape|type=geoshape|wikidata=Q959944, Q1765582, Q1771488, Q1641049, Q1650230 |fill=#c9815e|title=[[Barcelona/Inland Suburbs|Inland Suburbs]]}} <!-- Les Corts, Sarri\\u00e0-Sant Gervasi, Horta-Guinard\\u00f3, Nou Barris, Sant Andreu -->\\n\\n{{Mapshapes|Q237189|stroke-opacity=0.6}} <!-- metro -->\\n\\n{{Regionlist\\n| region1name=[[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]\\n| region1color=#bdbd7b\\n| region1description=Barcelona's old town, including the medieval Barri G\\u00f2tic, La Rambla (Les Rambles), Raval, and El Born (also known as La Ribera)\\n\\n| region2name=[[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]]\\n| region2color=#8888dc\\n| region2description=Modernist quarter, central hub of the city, and ''the'' area to go to find Antoni Gaud\\u00ed's work.\\n\\n| region3name=[[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]]\\n| region3color=#75bb75\\n| region3description=Formerly an independent town, it joined the city in the 20th century.

However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\\n\\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to [[Costa Daurada]], north to [[Costa Brava]] or out to sea for the [[Balearic Islands]].\\n\\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low. Given the high humidity, {{convert|19|-|23|\\u00b0C|0}} is considered comfortable weather, which is usually the temperature from May to June, and from late August to October. These are the best times to visit the city.  Anything warmer than this can feel too hot, and the period from November to April is quite chilly and at times gloomy.\\n\\n===With children===\\nToddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain. In any public place, people around you will make every effort possible to make your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them.

Fa\\u00e7ana de la Passi\\u00f3.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia church by Antoni Gaud\\u00ed is perhaps the most known landmark of Barcelona]]\\n\\nBarcelona's official languages are [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] and [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]. About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese. On the other hand, FGC announcements \\u2013 either regular or disruptions \\u2013 will be made only in Catalan, and disruption announcements on RENFE's network will usually be made only in Spanish. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a separate Romance language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.\\n\\nYou might find some locals answer in Catalan after being asked in Spanish, that's not because they are being rude but because they assume you are bilingual. In Catalonia, it's not uncommon to hear people code switching between different languages in the same conversation. In case you can't understand what they are saying, tell them you don't speak Catalan and politely ask them to repeat it in Spanish or English.\\n\\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia is a large scale immigration process from the rest of Spain, which occurred over the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language, and 40% use Catalan. The issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere.\\n\\nIn tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak English. If you are a native English speaker, you will have few problems, as Barcelona hosts many tourists.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n===By plane===\\n[[File:Aeropuerto de Barcelona (1322744358).jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona International Airport]]\\nThe main airport is {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona El Prat|wikidata=Q56973}} ({{IATA|BCN}}). Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use the airports of ''[[Girona]]'' ({{IATA|GRO}}), nearly {{km|100}} to the north, or ''[[Reus]]'' ({{IATA|REU}}), around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair started operating at BCN, you should check carefully where your flight goes. The three-letter IATA code should be part of your booking process.\\n\\n====Barcelona International Airport====\\n{{main|Barcelona El Prat Airport}}\\n\\n[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Barcelona/en/Barcelona-El-Prat.html Barcelona International Airport] ({{IATA|BCN}}), also known as '''El Prat''', is a major transport hub, with flights from all over Europe and beyond, is by far the closest airport to the city. To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for \\u20ac5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs \\u20ac12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport) , tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (\\u20ac7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya on its way to Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya. See the Public Transport section in Get Around below for more information on tickets & passes as there were major changes in 2023.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Girona-Costa-Brava/en/Home.html Girona\\u2013Costa Brava Airport]====\\nThe Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estaci\\u00f3 del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport, synchronised with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs \\u20ac16 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac25. The journey takes approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Timetables are available [http://www.sagales.com/index.php?nIdioma=LANG3 online]. You can also take a train (you can choose between local ''Rodalies'', ''Media Distancia'' and high speed  AVE trains with different travel times and price points) to Girona main train station and a local bus from there to the airport.\\n\\n====[http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Reus/en/ Reus Airport]====\\nThe easiest way is to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs \\u20ac13 and a return ticket costs \\u20ac24. The journey takes from 1 hr 30 min to 1 hr 45 min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available [http://www.igualadina.com/pdfs/REUS%20AIRPORT.pdf? online]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs \\u20ac7.25 and then the bus costs \\u20ac2.5. This takes about 2\\u00bd hours. Train timetables can be checked at Renfe's [http://www.renfe.com website] and the bus timetable is available at the [http://www.reustransport.cat/pdf/L50.pdf website]{{Dead link|date=November 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} of Reus public transport.\\n\\n[[File:Estacio Barcelona Sants - 1 - 2010-10-18 - JTCurses.jpg|thumbnail|right|Barcelona Sants railway station]]\\n\\n===By train===\\n[[File:RENFE AVE S-103 15.jpg|thumbnail|right|Superfast trains will whiz you to Barcelona from across Spain and France]]\\n\\nBarcelona is well-connected to the Spanish railway network, and to the rest of Europe. High-speed trains run frequently from main station {{marker|type=go|name=Barcelona Sants|wikidata=Q800453|lat=41.37911238|long=2.139878268|url=https://www.adif.es/w/71801-barcelona-sants}} (in the southwest of the city) to Madrid, Seville and Malaga. There are also regular long-distance connections that partially use high-speed infrastructure to all major Spanish cities. The station is also served by many regional lines including {{rint|catalonia|rdc}}{{rint|catalonia|r1}}{{rint|catalonia|r2}}{{rint|catalonia|r2s}}{{rint|catalonia|r2n}}{{rint|catalonia|r3}}{{rint|catalonia|r4}}{{rint|catalonia|r11}}\\n\\nThe historic {{marker|type=go|name=Estaci\\u00f3 de Fran\\u00e7a|wikidata=Q800449}} now mostly serves regional trains.\\n\\nDirect regular [https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-europe/tgv-inoui-espagne/ high-speed train service] goes to destinations in France. In addition to two daily TGV services from [[Paris]] (travel time ~7 hr to Barcelona), there is a daily service from [[Lyon]] (5 hr), and a daily service from [[Marseille]] (4 hr). Prices start at \\u20ac39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\\n\\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerb\\u00e8re/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\\n\\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7\\u20138 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly \\u20ac30.\\n\\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called ''[http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/larga_distancia/productos/trenhotel.html Trenhotel]'' between Barcelona and Paris. ''Trenhotels'' still do, however, run between Barcelona and [[Granada]], [[A Coru\\u00f1a]] and [[Vigo]].\\n\\nThe security checks are taken seriously and may take some time.

It takes little over an hour to walk from Port Vell at the seaside to Park G\\u00fcell at the foothills of the mountain range at the northeastern end of the city, and you can see a range of attractions, including La Rambla and Sagrada Fam\\u00edlia, on your way. There are opportunities all around to sit down and enjoy a drink or a meal everywhere. If you are fit, you can pretty much explore the city by foot alone, unless the heat beats you in the warmer months (and then you can always resort to the air-conditioned metro).\\n\\n=== By car ===\\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (\\u20ac3/hour, \\u20ac20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\\n\\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, ''Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes'' is actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\\n\\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\\n* Near ''Moll de Sant Bertran'' (which is south-west from ''Museu Maritim'') - driving at B\\u201310, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\\n* Somewhere near Guell Park.\\n* Near Font M\\u00e0gica, in Pla\\u00e7a Espanya and the Montju\\u00efc hill.\\n\\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.\\n\\n=== By taxi ===\\nAs of January 2019, [[Ride-sharing and carsharing services|ride-sharing services]] such as Uber require at least one hour's notice. For less than one hour's notice, you need to call a regular taxi.\\n\\n==See==\\n{{Mapframe|41.3917|2.1416|zoom=12|height=600|width=500}}\\n{{SeeDistricts}}\\n{{infobox|What to see in the dark|The most spectacular sights in the night are:\\n* ''Musical fountains'', in Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.

Head off into some of the side streets for a cheaper, more local, and authentic experience of Barcelona.

El Born means jousting field, and its history and stories can fill one of those huge books stored in old libraries. There are interesting and quirky details to uncover while walking around, such as the name given to its streets, the medieval signs to brothels, and remnants of the secession war of the end of the 18th century.

Moreover on the Port Vell, right at the end of The Ramblas there is Maremagnum, a shopping mall that stays open all Sundays.\\n\\nIf you see people selling items on the street on a blanket, do not buy from them.

Bon\\u00c0rea, Bonpreu and Condis are the most popular supermarket chains from Catalonia. Mercadona, Consum, and Dia are other popular chains from the rest of Spain. All of them are a cost-effective way to purchase grocery items. There are also organic/specialty supermarkets like Casa Ametller or Veritas which are pricier. Small corner stores are the most visible on city streets, but tend to mark up prices in exchange for convenience.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nAs with all cities which welcome large numbers of tourists, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, but there are plenty of restaurants serving excellent food at very reasonable prices, if you know where to look. The usual rules of thumb apply: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track used by fellow travellers, and seek out caf\\u00e9s and restaurants which the locals frequent. In practice, this usually involves searching out eateries in residential districts away from the main sightseeing attractions. Avoid restaurants with touts outside, and have a basic understanding of the traditional foods served in restaurants, as well as the local drinks. One slightly crafty way of sussing a place's authenticity at a glance is to take note of how they spell a certain word: a menu board advertising ''tap'''a'''s'', written the Spanish/international way, is likely to be somewhere which primarily caters to tourists, whereas somewhere offering ''tap'''e'''s'', using Catalan spelling, is in all probability a venue frequented by locals.\\n\\nSome districts to check out include [[Barcelona/Gr\\u00e0cia|Gr\\u00e0cia]], which is a hub of quality, affordable Catalan cooking of both the traditional and more avant-garde varieties, and the [[Barcelona/Eixample|Eixample]], whose chic boulevards have upscale restaurants aplenty worthy of your splurge money. The fishing quarter of Barceloneta (in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]]) is an example of a neighbourhood where it pays to be picky: closer to the gentrified seafront, a slew of mojito beach bar-style places serve up expensive tourist tapas; for the real thing, head into the backstreets, where many traditional bars are still tucked away. In all cases, be prepared to \\\"promenade\\\" in search of the most attractive-looking menu; that's what the locals do, after all.\\n\\n{{infobox|Where to eat during siesta|The majority of restaurants and cafes are closed 16:00-20:00 for ''migdiada''. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:\\n* tapas in bars\\n* international chains\\n* food stands in market halls}}\\n\\n'''Set menus (men\\u00fa del migdia / men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda)''' Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a ''men\\u00fa del migdia'' / ''men\\u00fa del d\\u00eda'' (menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for \\u20ac12 to \\u20ac20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 14:00 to 16:00. The savvy traveller will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve ''platos combinados'', which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.\\n\\n'''Smoking''' is not permitted inside bars and restaurants since 2011, but it's usually allowed in terraces.\\n\\n===Dishes===\\n[[File:Tapas Barcelona.jpg|thumb|250px|A plate of ''tapes'']]\\n\\nYou can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.\\n\\n''See [[Catalonia#Catalan Cuisine|Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article]].''\\n\\nThe selection of '''seafood''' is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).\\n\\nA treat to try that no travel guide mentions is '''waffles''' sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\\n\\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\\n\\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of '''durum''' or '''shawarma''' stands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around \\u20ac5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the '''Asian''' selection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants, while '''Latin American''' offerings, particularly Argentine and [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], are well-represented too.\\n\\n===Food tours===\\n\\nIf you feel lost in the variety of food choices there are \\u2013 Catalan, Basque, Spanish, and beyond \\u2013 it may be helpful to do a food tour to quickly get oriented.

The following areas tend to be restaurant \\\"hubs\\\", with a large variety of restaurants to choose from:\\n* [[Barcelona/Barceloneta|Barceloneta]]: A popular quarter for locals, where you can try fish based dishes, such as ''Paella'' (a name that may hide many different kinds of rice concoctions) or ''Arr\\u00f2s negre'' (''Black Rice''), that takes its colour because it is made using squid ink. Barceloneta is a very good place to eat ''tapas'' as well.\\n* Sant Antoni is the new addition to the culinary scene in Barcelona where old and trendy cuisine mingle.\\n* Eixample Esquerra (between Gran Via and Mallorca)\\n* Barri G\\u00f2tic (especially for tapas)\\n* \\\"El Born\\\" (next to Barri G\\u00f2tic)\\n\\nAround Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya there are dozens of restaurants serving ''tapas''. One should be careful with the tourist traps as the area is highly populated with tourists.\\n\\nFor budget eating you may choose \\\"men\\u00fa del migdia\\\" in small bars on the Avinguda del Parallel for \\u20ac9-11 per person. Be aware that sometimes the menu and the staff are only in Spanish.\\n\\nThe large cafes that line the Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia and the Rambla Catalunya, just north of the Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, offer a variety of acceptable tapas. This part of the town is quite touristy and a bit expensive.\\n\\n{{eatpricerange|Up to \\u20ac10|\\u20ac10\\u2013\\u20ac25|\\u20ac25 and up}}\\n\\n=== Groceries ===\\n\\nIn several supermarkets you can find a wide stall with a great selection of ready-to-eat dishes.

Chupitos is Spanish for \\\"shots\\\" and offers hundreds of unique shots including the \\\"Harry Potter\\\" (a shot that sparks as cinnamon is sprinkled over it), and \\\"Monica Lewinsky\\\" (a variety of flaming shots) among others.

Every district has plentiful offerings, and thanks to the efficient public transportation you can stay comfortably in any of them, depending on your budget and preferences.\\n\\nDuring festivals (see [[#Festivals and events|Festivals and events]] above), especially during [http://www.mobileworldcongress.com Mobile World Congress], which is a major trade show at the Fira, accommodation in Barcelona and especially near the Fira is much more difficult to find and more expensive than usual.\\n\\n* [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella#Sleep|Ciutat Vella]] offers a mix of luxury hotels and cheerful hostels within a dense urban environment.

Wi-Fi is widely available in public places and on transport.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Pickpockets===\\n\\n[[Pickpockets|Pickpocketing]] is the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona. '''Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents''' in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\\n\\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\\n* At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\\n* A milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\\n* East Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \\\"martial arts\\\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\\n* These people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\\n* Male travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\\n* In the '''subway''', a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance ''and'' exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\\n* Under no circumstances should you '''leave your items''' unattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\\n\\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can [https://denuncies.dgp.interior.gencat.cat/denuncies/ file a report online] if you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices.\\n\\n===Scams===\\n{{Seealso|Common scams}}\\n\\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\\n\\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of [[common scams#Overcharging|methods]] are employed, including the [[common scams#No-change_trick|No-change trick]]. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Pla\\u00e7a d'Espanya.\\n\\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\\n\\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\\n\\nA version of [[common scams#Three Card Monte|Three Card Monte]] is one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\\n\\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you.\\n\\n===Violent crimes===\\n\\nIn 2019 there was a surge in violent crimes around Barcelona: in just the summer, there were almost as many violent deaths as there were for the whole previous year. While tourists are only occasionally targeted (and almost exclusively simple robberies), this should be not a going concern, many of these deaths are either drug-related or take place during drunken fights, so you are best advised to avoid such situations.\\n\\n===Football===\\nLocal club '''FC Barcelona''' (also known as \\\"Bar\\u00e7a\\\", a term used by locals to refer strictly to the club and not the city) is seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and has a very heated and politically-charged rivalry with Real Madrid, which is seen as a symbol of the Spanish state and ruling establishment, and violent confrontations between the supporters of both clubs have been known to occur. Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\\n\\nFurthermore, the local ''Derbi barcelon\\u00ed'' between FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain. If you hear Bar\\u00e7a and Espanyol fans having an argument, be careful, as things can quickly escalate.\\n\\n===ATMs===\\nBarcelona offers ATMs in many locations. Many provide a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.), and most accept ATM/debit/credit cards of various banks. Choose an ATM in a secure or highly-public space (e.g., in a bank lobby or airport terminal) to avoid machines modified by criminals to skim/video your card data or where you might be robbed after use.  Ensure early in usage that the ATM supports a language you understand. For a full discussion of safe/effective charge/debit/ATM card usage and their cost trade-offs, see also [[Money]]. They will charge you a usage fee on top of anything your bank charges you which should be declared on the screen before you proceed (2,90\\u20ac for a 500\\u20ac withdrawal as of Oct. 2024 across different banks).\\n\\n===Areas of caution===\\n\\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (''cercanias'' in Spanish or ''rodalies'' in Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\\n\\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montju\\u00efc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\\n\\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\\n\\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\\n\\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\\n\\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\\n\\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.\\n\\n===Anti-tourism movement===\\n\\nMany Barcelona residents have the impression that there are too many tourists in Barcelona and that it has increased living costs, as landlords prefer to rent to tourists and not to locals to make more profit. Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024.\\n\\n===Cars===\\n\\nTourist drivers may attract special attention, such as [[common scams#Red light bag snatch|Red light bag snatch]] or [[common scams#Flat tire|Flat tire scams]]\\n\\n===Public transportation===\\n\\nBesides being a particular pickpocket hot spot, there are plenty of fare evaders who will stick to you when crossing a fare barrier. Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean ''carte blanche'' for them. The fare evasion fine is just \\u20ac50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome.\\n\\n===Reporting crimes===\\n\\nIf you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers generally do not speak English, even though the theft report form is in English, Spanish, and Catalan. The police station most often used to report theft is the one underneath Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya beside metro station, where they have some translators for common languages.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n===Hospitals===\\nEU citizens can get free or reduced cost medical treatment on presentation of an EHIC card and passport.\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Hospital Clinic I Provincial De Barcelona | url= | email=\\n| address=C/ Villarroel 170 | lat= | long= | directions=Metro Stn Hospital Clinic (Line 5)\\n| phone=+34 932 275 400 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n\\n===Consulates===\\n\\n{|\\n|-\\n| style=\\\"vertical-align:top;width:50%;\\\" |\\n* {{flag|Angola}} {{listing\\n| name=Angola | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer del Consell de Cent, 413-415 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 245 02 73 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Argentina}} {{listing\\n| name=Argentina | url=http://cbarc.mrecic.gov.ar/en | email=\\n| address=Passeig de Gr\\u00e0cia, 11 (08007) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 304 12 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Australia}} {{listing\\n| name=Australia | url=http://spain.embassy.gov.au/madr/home.html | email=ausconbcn@gmail.com\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 433 Bis, Second Floor, Door 1 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 362 3792 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Austria}} {{listing\\n| name=Austria | url= | email=barcelona@consuladodeaustria.com\\n| address=Carrer de Mari\\u00e0 Cub\\u00ed, 7 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 368 60 03 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bangladesh}} {{listing\\n| name=Bangladesh | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Londres, 35 (08029) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 410 83 89 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belgium}} {{listing\\n| name=Belgium |alt=| url=http://www.diplomatie.be/barcelonafr/default.asp?id=31&mnu=31 | email=barcelona@diplobel.fed.be\\n| address=Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 680 (08010) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 80 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n|wikidata=|lastedit=2020-08-05| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Belize}} {{listing\\n| name=Belize | url= | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 469 (08036) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 430 30 44 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Benin}} {{listing\\n| name=Benin | url=http://www.consuladobenin.com/ | email=consuladobenein@terra.es\\n| address=Carrer d'Arag\\u00f3, 290 (08009) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 467 70 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bolivia}} {{listing\\n| name=Bolivia | url=http://consuladodeboliviaenbarcelona.es/ | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Roger de Flor, 3 (08018) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 322 65 12 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Brazil}} {{listing\\n| name=Brazil | url=http://www.brasilbcn.org/ | email=\\n| address=Avinguda Diagonal, 468 (08006) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 488 22 88 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Bulgaria}} {{listing\\n| name=Bulgaria | alt= | url=https://www.mfa.bg/es/embassies/spain-barcelona | email=Consulate.Barcelona@mfa.bg\\n| address=Avinguda de la Riera de Cassoles, 54 (08012) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 937 969 950 | tollfree= | fax=+34 937 969 949\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Burkina Faso}} {{listing\\n| name=Burkina Faso | url= | email=\\n| address=Carrer de Muntaner, 261 (08021) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 93 200 99 09 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|Canada}} {{listing\\n| name=Canada | url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/spain-espagne/offices-bureaux/consul_barcelona.aspx | email=bclna@internacional.gc.ca\\n| address=Pla\\u00e7a Catalunya, 9 (08002) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+34 93 412 72 36 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{flag|France}} {{listing\\n| name=France | url=http://www.consulfrance-barcelone.org/ | email=info@consulfrance-barcelone.org\\n| address=Ronda Universitat 22 bis -

See the historical centre, the churches and cathedral, and visit many architectural works of Llu\\u00eds Dom\\u00e8nech i Montaner. Canet is the smallest town in [[Catalonia]] with many historical and modernist buildings. It also has a lot of ''blue flag'' beaches, recognised at the European level for their quality.\\n*[[Col\\u00f2nia G\\u00fcell]] \\u2014 is a tiny settlement famous for its modernist architecture. It is on the railway to [[Montserrat (Spain)|Montserrat]].\\n*[[Costa Brava]] - The coast North of Barcelona has rocky cliffs and a mix of pebble beaches and sandy beaches.\\n* [[Figueres]]- Home of the most impressive Salvador Dal\\u00ed museum.\\n*[[Girona]] - A quiet town with an ancient Jewish section, narrow streets, imposing walls and plenty of cafes. See directions to the north airport above.\\n* Montseny - UNESCO Biosphere Reserve {{km|40}} northeast of Barcelona. Go there by car or bus/train\\n* [[Montserrat (Spain)|Montserrat]]  - Visit the monastery nestled high in the mountains to see the Black Madonna or hike to the peak to earn a fantastic view of the surroundings. {{km|50}} from Barcelona.\\n* [[Parc del Garraf]] - Large natural area southwest of Barcelona. Many hikes can be reached by train. Be sure to bring sun protection and plenty of water. (An eleven mile hike, with some decent elevation gain: Take train to Castelldefels station, head up to Castel de Castelldefels, follow trail about 5 miles to La Morella, where you can take in some great views. Trace your steps back half a mile, then continue southwest towards Playa Garraf. Playa Grarraf is right by the Garraf train station, allowing easy access back to Barcelona.)\\n*[[Pyrenees]] - A mountain range around {{km|150}} north from the city.\\n*[https://www.visitsantcugat.cat/en/ Sant Cugat del Valles] - Has one of the most interesting Romanesque cloisters in Catalunya, with many interesting carvings. The town itself is full of expensive vilas.\\n* [[Sitges]] - A traditional beachside destination for the locals. Full of fashion shops open on Sundays. Is a popular gay destination too.\\n* [[Castelldefels]] - Another typical beachside destination for the locals. It is very popular for its wide range of gastronomy.\\n*[[Tarragona]] - Old Roman period capital of eastern Spain, and today small seaside city off the tourist trail compared to Barcelona.\\n* Visit the [[Nature parks in Barcelona province]].\\n{{routebox\\n| image3=C-16.svg\\n| imagesize3=50\\n| directionl3=N\\n| majorl3=[[Image:Tabliczka E9.svg|30px]] [[Girona Pyrenees]]\\n| minorl3=[[Terrassa]]\\n| directionr3=S\\n| minorr3=\\n| majorr3=ENDS AT VIA AUGUSTA\\n}}\\n\\n{{related|Ferries in the Mediterranean}}\\n\\n{{IsPartOf|Barcelona (province)}}\\n{{geo|41.3879|2.1699|zoom=12}}\\n{{usablecity}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Prague Town Hall Clock Wikivoyage banner.jpg|caption=Prague Town Hall clock}}\\nTravellers might often find themselves short of '''time''' for a journey, or at a destination. [[Business travel]]lers might need to devote most of their time for work.\\n\\nEven pleasure travellers might want to be time-efficient. Expenses for [[sleep|accommodation]] and [[food and drink|food]] rack up as a journey gets longer (especially in high-income countries), and [[returning home]] for work and daily life is usually necessary.\\n\\nWeekend journeys and [[bachelor(ette) parties]] usually feature ambitious plans, but have a short time to complete them.\\n\\n==Prepare==\\n{{seealso|Timepieces}}\\n{{quote|He must rise betimes who fain of another<br>or life or wealth would win;<br>scarce falls the prey to sleeping wolves,<br>or to slumberers victory in strife.|author=H\\u00e1vam\\u00e1l}}\\nPeople who are not in full-time employment have more time to travel. [[Studying abroad]], [[gap year travel]] and [[senior travel]] are opportunities to have a long journey.\\n\\nPlanning and preparation take time before the journey. While the planning itself is a pleasure for some people, a [[travel agencies|travel agency]] might make it faster.\\n\\nA common mistake among new travellers is to be too optimistic about itinerary planning.\\n\\nMust-do activities at a destination should not fill more than half your schedule on the destination. This is especially true for huge cities with many well-known attractions (such as [[New York City]] or [[Paris]]). Having a plan of what you want to do and an idea of the \\\"lay of the land\\\" before heading out can also save a lot of time. If you've only got one weekend you can't afford to spend a day just to get oriented.\\n\\nAs intercontinental travel no longer costs a fortune, few destinations are once-in-a-lifetime.\\n\\nOn a multi-stop journey or a road trip, transportation takes much time away from time on the destinations. Detours from your main destination might be a waste of time. If you have a few days in [[Rome]], the historical city centre is enough to keep you busy. Even though [[Metropolitan Naples]] has famous attractions such as [[Vesuvio]] and [[Pompeii]], it is wise to leave them for another visit.\\n\\n[[Time zones]] can work for and against a traveller. When you fly westwards, you \\\"borrow\\\" hours, and might arrive around the same time as you took off. [[Jet lag]] can be a stress factor, though.\\n\\nPublic holidays and school vacations are times when many people travel. Plan for this in advance to avoid surprises. Look for websites with this information \\u2013 for example on [https://www.schulferien.org/ school vacations in Germany]. Countries such as Germany deliberately stagger their school holiday season to relieve congestion on major North-South routes that bring travellers to popular summer destinations along the North and Baltic Sea Coast and in Italy. Countries like France on the other hand have one single day on which all school kids in the entire country start their summer holidays. Try to avoid traveling on that day if you can.\\n\\nCarrying, packing and unpacking excessive [[baggage]] slows down the journey. Flying without check-in baggage allows you to skip the baggage claim area (unless there is no room for your cabin bag and you are forced to check it in). A heavy suitcase might require detours around staircases and passages.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n{{seealso|Planning your flight|Arriving in a new city}}\\n\\n[[Flying]] is the fastest way to travel long distances. Direct flights are fastest. Multiple-leg flights can differ a lot in total time; use [[aggregators]] to evaluate them against each other.\\n\\nRemember to add your time to get to airport, check in, get through security, clear [[border crossing|border checkpoints]], go to baggage claim if necessary, get to the exit and then get from the airport to wherever you're staying; all of this can add a few extra hours to the journey, making driving or taking a train or bus as quick and more flexible on journey start time for medium length journeys. Check which airport is closest to the city centre. Some cities have more than one airport and one may be located just a few kilometres from the city centre while the other airport is located in the suburbs. Airports like [[Hahn]] are famously nowhere close to cities they are named after, but even places like [[Munich Airport]] can be almost an hour by public transit from the downtown of the city they serve. Others like Taipei Songshan Airport, Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, London City Airport and Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport are so close to the city centre that it takes as little as 15 minutes to reach the downtown core of the city.\\n\\nWhen buying plane tickets that involve changes of plane, make sure you'll arrive at the second airport in time. It's rarely a smart idea to try to save half an hour by choosing an overly tight connection, because the first plane may get delayed. In the case of severe delays and if you're the only passenger the connecting flight would need to wait for, they often aren't going to wait for you even if the second flight is operated by the same airline and the journey is on the same ticket. Even if you make it to the plane, if you have checked luggage it may get left behind. Missing your connecting flight ''will'' even in the best case add hours to your trip, and in the worst case, you could get stuck for days. The same goes to some extent for other forms of transport.\\n\\nIf there is a [[rail travel|rail line]], particularly [[high speed rail]] between two destinations no further than 500 kilometres apart, it is usually faster than flying. In addition, most train stations are in the center of cities or at least much closer to the center than many airports. In Europe and East Asia, railways and airlines are increasingly aggressive in their competition on both speed and price on many busy routes.\\n\\nWhen estimating [[driving]] time, navigation apps usually assume that the driver will drive at the maximum allowed speed. Considering the risk of slow traffic and [[severe weather]] and the need for regular breaks, you might want to dedicate twice the nominal time to reach your destination on long trips, or perhaps even more when driving alone or when there is only one available driver.\\n\\nThink about what you can do during the journey. Flying may be the quickest way of reaching the destination, but even with a window seat you won't see much of the country. Taking a train or coach may be much slower, but what you can see from the window (or even just the vehicle and the people around you, in more exotic environments) may be a valuable part of the experience. On a business trip, if you have a reserved seat on a train, you may be able to prepare for your meeting for most of the journey. If a train takes four hours in a comfortable seat with reliable Wi-Fi whereas a plane takes the same four hours hustling and bustling around through security and taxis with barely a minute to sit down and get the laptop open, that's a good reason to prefer the train.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nIn cities, [[public transportation]] is usually an efficient method to get around. However, transit systems work very differently. Some have long delays or shutdowns. The schematic route maps also rarely give a realistic impression of the time needed for a journey, although quite a few transit systems provide estimated trip times and schedules on their websites.\\n\\nEspecially when you drive, but for other means of transport as well, avoid rush hours. In most urban areas, these are 7\\u20139 AM, and 4\\u20136 PM.  However, for some tourist destinations, such as California's [[wine country]], or any popular beach town, the \\\"rush hour\\\" might start on Friday evening and end on Sunday night. In addition, some big cities, like New York, have extended rush hours that can last most of the afternoon and evening, and any time of day in Paris or Los Angeles is somewhat likely to have bad traffic. In general, even in the rare cases that driving in major cities is faster than public transit, it often tires you faster and leaves you with less energy to do something fun. You can study a map or guidebook on public transit while heading somewhere. You can't do that while driving, but you could delegate this task to a trusty passenger.\\n\\nOn a [[road trip]], plan your route to avoid passing through large metropolitan areas, unless you are planning to visit them. Above all avoid going through them at rush hour.\\n\\n[[Spectator sports]], festivals and other big events can also congest traffic. One method is to have accommodation near the venue, or to arrive early and spend time within walking distance. Parades can really ruin traffic, as streets are reserved for festivities, and fireworks displays on major holidays such as New Year's Eve or a country's Independence Day often involve closing large segments of superhighways, so that spectators can set up lawn chairs or stand in the lanes to watch. Many cities have websites that list all scheduled parades for the year.\\n\\nIf you are using large rental car companies, use their member cards. These will have your driving license and credit card on record. After the first time used, you will not need to stand in line at the counter and fill out paperwork.  Simply walk directly to your booked car and show member card and license at the exit.\\n\\n==Eat==\\n[[Street food]], fast food or a ready-made meal from a supermarket can save time, as well as packing [[camping food]] such as sandwiches, bananas, or nutrition bars (with the consideration that baggage slows you down).\\n\\nEating in a vehicle saves time, and might in some cases be an enjoyable experience (a gourmet meal in a railroad dining car, or on a cruise ferry). While airline food has become better than its reputation, portions are rather small. Eating in [[public transportation]] vehicles and [[taxis]] is sometimes prohibited, and usually bad manners.\\n\\nIn many restaurants, there can be a big difference in the waiting time for different dishes. Some fast food restaurants have a screen showing which dishes they have ready and can give you immediately. For instance the fresh fish may take 25 minutes to be cooked from scratch, but the stew may be ready to be dished in the kitchen. The \\\"meal of the day\\\", where such are offered, is usually served quite fast. Usually your group will all be served at once, so one slow dish can hold everybody up. Ask the waiting staff for suggestions to have a quick meal, and say if you want dishes to come as soon as they are ready. However, there are some countries such as Italy where you simply can't expect to have a quick meal in a restaurant. In those places, you should consider going to a bar or snack bar (such as a d\\u00f6ner/shawarma or falafel place in some countries) if you want to have a quick hot meal.\\n\\nA buffet restaurant usually lets guests eat without waiting.\\n\\nIf waiting for a meal is unavoidable, the wait can be a good time to double check your itinerary, message local contacts about plans, use the [[toilet]] or take some photos. Prefer a restaurant which is enjoyable in its own right; where you have a comfortable seat without noise or bad smell; ideally a good view or quaint furnishing.\\n\\nAs a general principle, more expensive restaurants are intended for longer visits. A [[fine dining]] experience is intended to be around two hours or more.\\n\\nAn empty restaurant looks bad. If there are very few guests, the staff might want to lengthen your stay. Make it clear that you expect a bill as soon as the food is served so your time is spent efficiently.\\n\\n==Do==\\nIf you stay more than a day in a city, a [[guided tour]] is usually a good starter activity. It gives you an overview of the city, advice on other attractions, and possibly new companions.\\n\\nTourist attractions are usually crowded on weekends and holidays. If you have the chance, visit them on weekdays.\\n\\n[[Museums]] and other attractions vary a lot in size, and in the time needed to see them. While a small art collection can be experienced in a few minutes, you could easily spend a week visiting a large institution such as the [[Louvre]].\\n\\n==Drink==\\nAlways have a bottle of [[water]] or juice with you to avoid spending time searching for a place to get it. At the airport remember to purchase after the last security check area, or bring an empty bottle that you can fill at the airport.\\n\\n==Buy==\\nYou can save time if you are careful to bring all [[equipment]] you need from home, instead of buying it at the destination. This makes your baggage heavier, though.\\n\\nHigh-end hotels have a convenience store or a travel store on site. If not, you should scout out a supermarket or other supply store nearby.\\n\\n[[Shopping]] takes time, and makes baggage heavier. If you want souvenirs or other things to take home, wait until the end of the journey, when you know how much time and money you can spare, and have a sense for local price levels. This way, you minimize the distance you need to carry your souvenirs.\\n\\n[[Bargaining]], or going between stores to find a better deal, is not always worth it if your time is valuable.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\nWhile sleep deprivation is a health hazard (and will usually ruin your travel experience) you could save some time and money if you sleep on a train, bus, plane, or ship. See [[Sleeper trains]], [[Bus travel#Sleep|Bus travel]] and [[Ferries#Sleep|Ferries]] for advice.\\n\\nBeing well-rested before a journey is usually a good start.\\n\\nHotel loyalty cards can save time at check-in. In the morning there is often a wait to check out, particularly in Europe on a business day. Consider checking out and settling your bill the night before when this is possible, then simply handing over your key in the morning (ignoring the queue). Most hotels are fine with this.\\n\\nChoose where you are going to stay carefully. You may save time if you choose a hotel which is close to public transport connections, perhaps next to an urban rail station which is on several different routes.

Old bridge abutments are in the river at roughly Norton Street and Dock Street. A par of cars are just after the bridge abutments. Exiting at the Chippawa Public Boat Ramp is recommended.

While you can certainly get by without a car in the major cities, many scenic smaller towns and parks are only accessible by car.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n[[File:Transcanadienne2.jpg|thumb|Signage to the Trans-Canadian highway in Manitoba]]\\n\\nThe history of automobile travel in Canada is inextricably linked to its southern neighbour, the [[United States]]. The Canadian automobile market had long been dominated by American companies, and driving culture is for the most part similar to that of the United States. Like the United States, Canada is a very car-dependent country, and most adult Canadians own cars. While the cities of [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]] can be traversed using public transport, in most other places a car is almost essential due to the infrequency or even absence of public transport. \\n\\nAll road signs in Canada use metric units. Distance and speed are marked in kilometres and kilometres per hour. Most American cars have speedometers that display both units, or have a switch that allows you to change units, but if yours doesn't, see [[Metric and imperial equivalents#Driving speed]] (one mile is about 1.6 km).\\n\\nLike most countries, Canadians drive on the right in left-hand drive cars. Most rental cars are automatic transmission. Stick-shift (manual transmission) cars are rarely available unless you have made special arrangements in advance.\\n\\nAlthough Canada is the second largest country in the world by land area after Russia, its population size is similar to that of [[Poland]] or [[Morocco]]. Outside the [[Windsor-Quebec corridor]], distances are often vast and easy to underestimate; you may have to travel hundreds, or even thousands of kilometres before you can see the next trace of civilization. Motorists who wish to head off the beaten track need to be prepared for the elements, especially during Canada's notoriously harsh winters, and a [[mobile telephones|satellite phone]] may be worthwhile investment if you are travelling to really remote areas.\\n\\n===Automobile clubs===\\n\\nThe largest motoring group in Canada is the '''[https://www.caa.ca/ Canadian Automobile Association (CAA)]''', which is comprised of numerous regional [[automobile association|automobile clubs]] located throughout the country. Their services to members include roadside assistance and maps, a travel agency and discounts at various establishments. It is worth considering getting in touch with your local club before you set off on a road trip, as their assistance can be valuable in the event of something unexpected. The CAA also has reciprocal agreements with motoring groups in other countries, so some of their services may be available to travellers who are members of their local motoring group back home. \\n\\nAmerican Automobile Association (AAA) members may obtain the three CAA/AAA TourBooks (Western Canada, Ontario, Quebec-Atlantic) from their home club stateside.\\n\\n===Border crossings===\\nCrossing the border with the United States in either direction with a rental car is fairly straightforward with one of the large multinational car rental companies, but be sure to let them know in advance, even if you don't intend to stay overnight, as additional documentation will be required. Most of these companies will allow you to pick up a car in Canada and drop it off in the U.S. and vice versa.\\n\\n==Signage==\\nThe most noticeable difference for travellers may be the language of road signage; road signs are in English in most of the country, in [[French phrasebook|French]] in [[Quebec]], bilingual in English and French in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Ottawa]], and bilingual in English and the local indigenous language (such as [[Inuktitut phrasebook|Inuktitut]]) in [[Nunavut]]. Aside from the language, the design of Canadian road signs is fairly consistent throughout the country and inspired by those in the United States. In Quebec, while road signs are solely in French, for the most part their meaning is obvious. Unlike the U.S., the majority of road signs in Canada are mainly icons rather than words.\\n\\n==Traffic laws==\\n\\nDriving laws in Canada are regulated at the provincial level, and rules of the road vary slightly from province to province. Differences in driving laws between the provinces are, for the most part, fairly minor.\\n\\n[[File:RCMP IRSU Ford Taurus PI.jpg|thumb|Traffic enforcement unit car of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]\\n\\n* Pedestrians have the right of way at intersections and crosswalks, provided they are not crossing against a signal.\\n* In Canada, you must always yield to a police car, fire truck, or ambulance when their emergency lights are flashing \\u2013 if they are approaching from behind, you must pull to the right and stop.\\n* Private vehicles displaying flashing green lights in Ontario are volunteer fire fighters responding to an emergency, and should be yielded to as a matter of common sense.\\n* In many jurisdictions, including British Columbia, motorists are also required to slow down and move into a non-adjacent lane when passing a stopped emergency vehicle. Slowing to 60&nbsp;km/h is the norm on a highway.\\n* The use of hand-held mobile devices while driving is banned in all provinces. Yukon is considering such a ban as well. Use of hands-free devices while driving is legal throughout Canada, although the Canadian Automobile Association is lobbying for such a ban. Some provinces such as Alberta expand upon this basic ban with Distracted Driving laws that also forbid other activities such as reading maps, doing makeup, and programming on-board GPS systems while driving.\\n* Some provinces have blood alcohol limits of 0.05%.  The national Criminal Code limit is 0.08% \\u2013 a foreign national exceeding this can expect to be fined heavily and deported \\u2013 See respect below. Police in some provinces such as B.C. and Alberta may impound vehicles temporarily if the driver is between 0.05% and 0.08%, even though this doesn't violate national laws. Most provinces have \\\"Checkstop\\\" programs in place \\u2014 these are randomly placed police checkpoints, usually set up at night, during which an officer will ask motorists if they've been drinking and gauge based upon their response and other factors whether to initiate further roadside sobriety or breathalyser tests. If you encounter one while driving \\u2014 and assuming you ''haven't'' been drinking \\u2014 in most cases you'll be let through after only a few seconds, though you may be asked to show your driver's licence (have your car rental agreement handy too, if it's requested).\\n* During winter, a flashing blue light usually identifies a snow removal vehicle in the six eastern provinces.  Snow removal vehicles in the four western provinces use amber lights.\\n* In British Columbia, a (slow) flashing green light means the traffic light is green (you can go) but it is controlled by the pedestrian. The light will remain flashing green until a pedestrian pushes the button to cross the street; when you see a flashing green light, traffic coming towards you will also see a flashing green light. In Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, a (fast) flashing green light indicates advanced turn, signalling the driver can make a left hand turn across oncoming traffic because oncoming traffic has a red light.\\n* Most provinces allow studded tires in the winter months (roughly October 15 to April 15; depends on the province), and some provinces allow studded tires all year; however, southern Ontario prohibits them year-round.\\n* In British Columbia, there are many roads, mainly in mountain passes, which require vehicles to be equipped with winter tires or carry chains from October 1 to April 30.\\n* In Quebec, winter tire use is mandatory for all taxis and passenger vehicles from December 15 to March 15. (This applies only to vehicles registered in the province; tourists driving into the province can use all season tires.)\\n\\nCanadian winter tires have the mountain snowflake logo on the sidewall. Except for Quebec, Canadian rental (hire) cars do not routinely come with winter tires, but vehicles with winter tires are often available by request. \\n\\n===Licences===\\n[[File:International Driving Permit-ROK.jpg|thumb|An International Driving Permit (design may vary by issuing country) is necessary if your driving licence isn't in English or French]]\\n\\nAll drivers in Canada are required to have a valid licence. While the precise requirements vary from province to province, foreigners in Canada on tourist or business visas are generally allowed to drive with their foreign licence for the duration of their stay provided their licence is in English or French. Foreign licences in other languages must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or an official translation before they can be used.\\n\\nForeigners on longer term visas (e.g. work, student or permanent residence visas) are usually allowed to drive in Canada on their foreign licence for 3-6 months depending on their province of residence, after which they will have to obtain a Canadian licence from the province they reside in. Driver's licences are issued by the respective province and territory governments, and licensing laws vary from province to province. Most foreigners will be required to sit for theory and practical tests before they can obtain a Canadian licence, and the list of countries whose licence holders are exempted from testing requirements varies from province to province. As new Canadian drivers are usually required to go through a graduated licensing process, be sure to obtain an extract of your driving record from the issuing authority of your foreign licence before arriving in Canada, as many provinces require proof of your driving experience in order to exempt you from the full process.\\n\\nAll Canadian provinces require motorists to carry proof of liability insurance and the car's registration papers in the vehicle. If you are driving a rented car, the rental agreement will suffice for those.\\n\\n===Drunk driving===\\n\\nCanada has very strict laws on drunk driving.  It is a criminal offense, not a mere traffic violation, and it carries a serious social taboo as well.\\n\\nUnder provincial laws, penalties for drunk driving usually have two levels: \\n* BAC over 0.05 (0.04 in [[Saskatchewan]]), also known as a ''warn'', and\\n* BAC over 0.08 (80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood), a ''fail''.\\n\\nA ''warn'' reading will result in immediate roadside suspension of your driver's license for 1\\u20137 days, in addition to any other penalties.  A ''fail'' reading will result in criminal charges, a lengthy license suspension, and in some provinces, immediate impoundment of the vehicle you were driving, lasting for 3\\u201330 days.\\n\\nCanada's federal Criminal Code provides criminal charges for anything above 0.08, with offenders being subject to fines and imprisonment.  Refusing to provide a breathalyser sample carries the same penalties as a ''fail''.  Even if you do not exceed the legal limit, you can still be charged with drunk driving if the police have reasonable grounds to believe that you are intoxicated (e.g. if you are caught driving erratically, or if you are involved in an accident). \\n\\nAs a foreigner, a drunk driving conviction will almost certainly mean deportation, and a ban from re-entering Canada for at least 5 years.\\n\\nSimilarly, driving while under the influence of drugs is not tolerated in Canada, and is treated in the same way as drunk driving.\\n\\n===Stunt driving===\\n\\nMost provinces have ''Stunt driving'' laws, which are intended to remove drivers from the road if they engage in exceptionally dangerous acts, such as street racing, chasing another vehicle through traffic, or exceeding the speed limit by more than 50 km/h.  If you are charged with this category of offense, the vehicle you were driving will be immediately impounded for 7 to 30 days, in addition to other penalties.\\n\\n===Traffic lights===\\n\\nin Canada, with the exception of the Island of [[Montreal]], turning right on a red light is legal in Canada unless specifically prohibited by signage, provided you first come to a complete stop before entering the intersection, and yield to all cross traffic entering the intersection.\\n\\n===Speed limits===\\n\\nSpeed limit signs in Canada are white rectangles with black text reading \\\"MAXIMUM\\\" with the speed below. In the absence of signage, the default speed limit on urban roads is 45 km/h in the Northwest Territories and 50 km/h (~30 mph) anywhere else. On rural roads, the default speed limit is 50 km/h in the Yukon, 80 km/h (~50 mph) in Alberta (most rural roads), British Columbia and Ontario, 100 km/h (~60 mph) in Alberta (on highways), Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories and Saskatchewan, and 90 km/h anywhere else. For those not used to driving in North America look out for playground and school signs as these are not automatically on your vision radar. Within playground and school zones, that is roads passing by one, the limit will be 30 km/h (~20 mph), although this may only be at particular times. \\n\\nWith the exception of a few jurisdictions in Western Canada, radar detectors are banned in most Canadian provinces. A few provinces (Quebec and Alberta in particular) are infamous for using photo radar to mass-generate tickets which are sent not to the driver but to the vehicle's owner, long after the alleged offence - effectively compromising the ability of the hapless motorist to defend themselves against the accusations. Red light cameras exist in a few large cities.\\n\\n===Lane markings===\\nLane markings in Canada are similar to those in the United States. Lines dividing lanes of traffic moving in the same direction are painted in white, while those dividing traffic moving in opposite directions are painted in yellow. \\n\\nOn rural undivided highways, the center dividing line indicates whether or not passing is legal. A broken dividing line indicates that you may move to the other side of the road to pass if it is clear. A single solid dividing line indicates that passing is allowed but should be done with extreme caution due to potentially limited visibility, while a double solid dividing line indicates that no passing is allowed. A broken line next to a solid line means that you may move to the other side of the road to pass if you are driving on the side of the broken line but not if you're driving on the side of the solid line.\\n\\n===School buses===\\nYou are required to stop when you see a school bus picking up or letting off passengers regardless of which side of the road you are on. You are allowed to pass a stopped school bus from the opposite direction in a divided highway, except in British Columbia, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut and Prince Edward Island.\\n\\n==Road networks==\\n[[File:Yellowhead Highway - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Impressive view of Mt Robson on the Yellowhead Highway in British Columbia]]\\n\\nThe road network in Canada is less developed than in the United States, largely owing to its lower population density. Freeways are ubiquitous around major cities and along the densely populated Windsor-Quebec corridor. Elsewhere, Canadian intercity highways are mostly either four-lane divided highways (2 in each direction) or two-lane undivided highways. The [[Trans-Canada Highway]] is Canada's national highway. It is a network of paved provincial highways connected to each other that span the length of the country from [[Victoria (British Columbia)|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]] to [[St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. However, there are no bridges connecting [[Vancouver Island]] or Newfoundland to the mainland, meaning that you will have to cross the sea by car ferry. It is a freeway only for small parts of its length.\\n\\nIn the northern Arctic regions of the country, the road network is considerably less developed, with only a few roads linking the main population centres with major cities in the south. There are no roads into [[Nunavut]] from the other provinces and territories, and no roads connecting the different population centres within Nunavut; the only way to get there with your car would be to ship it over on a freighter in the summer months.\\n\\nWhen driving through the expanses of Canada keep an eye out for changes of road colour ahead, even on numbered roads they can change from tarmacked to stone-gravel road surfaces without any warning. If you do hit one at speed, do not brake or turn quickly until you have your speed down.\\n\\nAlthough the Trans-Canada Highway is fully paved, gravel roads are prevalent in many parts of rural Canada. Be very careful when driving on gravel roads, as it is much easier to skid and lose control of the vehicle than on paved roads.\\n\\n===City driving===\\nWith the exception of [[Vancouver]] and [[Winnipeg]], most major Canadian cities have a system of urban freeways that allow rapid driving from the city centre to the suburbs. Driving habits in Canadian cities are similar to that in most other Western cities, and congestion can be expected during the morning and evening peak hours. Particularly in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, parking in the city centre can be hard to find and expensive, and you may want to consider leaving your car in a garage and using public transport instead.\\n\\n=== Logging roads ===\\nIf you go a little off the main roads, be careful on roads used by logging trucks. These trucks require the full road and tend to drive very fast. Be aware of milepost marking on the sides of the road, by which other road users will be transmitting their position on CB. Also keep a look out for dust clouds, and pull over to the side of the road when you do see them.\\n\\n=== Toll roads ===\\n[[File:Electronic Toll Equipment in Ontario.jpg|thumb|Toll gantry on Highway 407 in Ontario]]\\n\\nToll roads are less common in Canada than in the United States; a difference which is more than made up for by Canada's high fuel taxes. There are a few notable exceptions. On a per-km basis, Highway 407, which bypasses [[Toronto]] by going north into [[York Region]], is one of the most expensive in North America (though it's a godsend for long-distance travellers through the Toronto area who are keen on avoiding the ever-present, sometimes hours-long traffic snarls on Highway 401). [[Nova Scotia]] operates one toll on the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] at the Cobequid Pass, despite imposing fuel taxes which are a nickel a litre higher than neighbouring [[New Brunswick]]. Access to islands such as [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Newfoundland]] or [[Vancouver Island]] by car will inevitably incur ferry or bridge tolls.\\n\\nAlthough not strictly toll roads, if you drive through a national park, for example Highway 1 [[Trans-Canada Highway]] through [[Banff National Park]], you will have to pay the park fee if you intend to stop or park your vehicle within the park boundaries.\\n\\n=== Fuel ===\\nFuel in Canada is sold by the litre; there are 4.5 litres in an imperial gallon, or 3.78 litres in a U.S. one. Fuel taxes, while not as high as those in Europe, are painful by U.S. standards. Montreal Island, [[Quebec City]] and Vancouver tax fuel heavily in an attempt to force local commuters onto public transit. Fuel in remote areas (such as [[Labrador]]) tends to be the most expensive in the nation.\\n\\nIn some remote locations (such as the [[Trans-Labrador Highway]] or the [[James Bay]] Road) the distance to the next filling station may be more than 400 km (250 miles). Don't set out without a full tank (and preferably a spare can), as well as enough supplies to survive stranded for hours if the vehicle breaks down.\\n\\n=== Distances ===\\nDo not underestimate distances between towns. It is easy to forget when you arrive by plane in a major Canadian city with a gas station on every corner that once you get out into the country you can drive for a number of hours without coming across a large settlement. Make sure you have a full tank of fuel and drinking water before a journey of any length.\\n\\n== Stay safe ==\\n[[Image:Gros Morne NP 03.jpg|thumb|Moose collisions can be deadly]]\\n[[Image:2019-05-31 Pepsi delivery truck in \\\"turnpike double\\\" configuration on Queen Elizabeth II Highway south north of Lacombe 0092.jpg|thumb|A double semi-trailer on Alberta Highway 2]]\\n\\nOne of the reasons for visiting Canada is for the great outdoors and the wildlife. Be aware however that the wildlife does not always stay in the woods; keep an eye out for bears, deer, elk and mountain goats on the road. A moose on the highway is a Newfoundland stop sign and [[animal collisions]] can be deadly.\\n\\n[[Winter driving]] can be dangerous due to [[ice safety|snow and ice]]. Peak afternoon traffic travels in darkness for most Canadians in winter; blowing snow further lowers visibility on slippery roads during storms. A few remote communities rely on ice roads across frozen lakes or rivers; under the wrong conditions, taking a vehicle onto the open ice can be suicide. In mountainous areas in winter, roads may sometimes be closed due to avalanche conditions.\\n\\nBe careful driving near heavy trucks, particularly in the Prairies. Keep an adequate distance from them, watch for spray that can damage your windshield, and pass them with care. In the Prairies and rarely in other provinces, there are also a lot of double semi-trailers \\u2013 much like Australia's road trains \\u2013 on the highways; these can be at the form of B-trains or two {{m|16.2}} semi-trailers, and can reach {{m|38}} in length.\\n \\nTake extra care to look out for pedestrians, Canadians expect people to be polite and expect cars to stop for them even when they step out into the road unexpectedly without looking.\\n\\n==Itineraries==\\n*[[Trans-Canada Highway]]\\n*[[Yellowhead Highway]]\\n*[[Icefields Parkway]]\\n*[[Trans-Labrador Highway]] and [[Quebec Route 389]]\\n*[[Alaska Highway]] and [[Dempster Highway]]\\n*[[Stewart-Cassiar Highway]]\\n*[[Mackenzie Highway]]\\n*[[Driving between the Pacific Coast and the Rockies]]\\n*[[Sunshine Coast-Vancouver Island Circle Tour]]\\n*[[Windsor-Quebec corridor]]\\n*[[Driving between the contiguous United States and the Alaska Highway]]\\n*[[Pan-American Highway]]\\n\\n==See also==\\n*[[Canada without a car]]<!--If this redlink is not desirable, comment this out and keep this link until it is created; then remove this inline comment-->\\n*[[Driving in the United States]]\\n\\n{{usabletopic}}\\n{{PartOfTopic|Driving|Canada}}\", \"{{pagebanner|Paleontology in Canada banner.jpg}}\\nWhen it comes to '''palaeontology''', Canada never falls short.

Each community [https://maigeiko.tumblr.com/post/185722195819/hai-first-of-all-beautiful-tumbler-page-the has its own traditions and distinctive appearance]; in some cases, such as in Kyoto, there are as many as five distinct geisha communities in the city. Each community is made up of a number of geisha houses (''okiya''), which function somewhat like a talent agency. Every geisha belongs to one, which handles their booking, training, and in some cases even provides their lodging. Hanamachi also have many ''o-chaya''; these \\\"tea houses\\\" are not for tea, but are private event spaces where patrons go to be entertained by geisha.\\n\\nIn the largest Japanese cities, it can be easy to spot a geisha if you look in the right part of town. That said, many of the people you may see on the streets are not actually geisha or maiko, but are just out for a stroll in a costume. Today there's a burgeoning industry of '''''henshin'' studios''', where Japanese and foreigners alike pay around \\u00a58,000-15,000 to be \\\"transformed\\\" for an hour or so, with extra charges for designer kimono or better photo shoots.

(Much of the ceremony is in contemplative silence punctuated by a few formal comments, but towards the end the lead guest will ask the host to describe the tea, servingware, and decorations.) While casual dress may be acceptable today at informal ceremonies, you should check if there's a dress code, and probably try to dress up a little anyway.
